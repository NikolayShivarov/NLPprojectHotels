"Everything was perfect! Quite, cozy place to relax.",positive
Very friendly host and perfect breakfast!,positive
"It was just what we wanted for a week by the beach in winter,

Location was fab, apartment quiet and very well-equipped. Spotless clean.",positive
My stay in the house was a experiencing bliss in luxury. The house is sheer touch of beauty wrapped by luxury and complimented with kindness and care  from Lisbette & her parents making it a most remarkable stay.,positive
"The building itself has a very musty smell in the hallway (despite being built in 1988), but the apartment itself smells good, which makes it bearable. 
When showering, the hot water goes off every 2-3 minutes for about 20-30 seconds and then only cold water comes out. The hot water then comes back again. This should be checked out. That is the only thing we didn’t like about the apartment. ,

The view was great, the apartment furnished in a modern style and equipped with everything you may need. The apartment was clean. 
There is free, secure parking outside in the building’s parking lot or downstairs in the garage. 
Jan always responded promptly to all messages sent via Booking.com messenger.",positive
"Nothing,

Beautiful home! Great room, most comfortable bed! The hostess couldn’t do enough for you.  Very gracious and welcoming, even gave my husband a lift to his conference.  Thank you for your generous hospitality.  Would stay here again.",positive
"to many messages sending from the owner in the app. But it is only my filling.,

everything great! perfect location, perfect room, very clean, everything what you need inside, but the best of the best is the bath :)",positive
"Spacious, more than enough rooms, a lot of bath rooms. For electric car drivers, free charging at the Lidl in Givet, only 10 kms, 50 KW.",positive
"nothing -- place was perfect,

This is an excellent place to stay and I highly recommend staying there. The stay is extremely helpful. One of the best places I have stayed -- it is that good.",positive
Romantic room just around the corner from the train station.  Nice and different setting from most rooms with cute details. Excellent internet connection and Netflix available.,positive
"Nothing,

Everything- great to have a whole property for less than the price of a hotel",positive
"Would have like more coffee and some tea available in the room,

Bath a bit high to get out of, otherwise good comfortable room",positive
"Room is a bit dull. Some wall decorations or a plant would make the room more enjoyable.,

Unlike most B&B's it has an equiped kitchen.",positive
The breakfast should be better for that hotel level.,positive
"The B&B is located just next to Place Jourdan, so there are various options for dinner in the evening. The family is super nice and helpful and the breakfast is prepared in advance so everything is super COVID-safe!",positive
"Nothing,

The peacefulness, the spectacular decor, the kindness of the hosts, nothing was to much trouble",positive
"Nothing!,

Perfect! Near the central station and another facilities",positive
"Nothing :-),

Lovely area, lovely house, lovely hosts, a very rural area. Dinant 13 miles (20 km) to the North East is beautiful, a must see, drive along the river from Givet (6 miles (10 km) to the South East) to have the best experience.Thank you so much for your warm welcome and lovely stay. We would all love to visit again.",positive
"The stains on the floor in the room because of other customers ... .,

Everything",positive
"nothing,

Breakfast was super and more then enough. Super friendly host and very flexible. The B&B also had a very good parkinglot, easily accesible.",positive
"The rooms seemed a little dated. ,

The location was perfect. The staff was helpful. I recommend parking at the Parking Vrijdamarkt. It was clean and reasonably priced. It fit our minivan as well. Just a 3 minute walk from the hotel.",positive
"there are no negative things 😊,

i like this very much!",positive
"Nothing to dislike. ,

From the first moment we arrived we felt completely welcomed. The calm gardens, the duck pond, the trees, all added to the tranquil setting. Beautiful clean property, extremely comfortable bed, elegant decor. Tea and coffee, plus room fridge and snacks available. Wonderful breakfasts, almond croissants to die for! Owners could not do enough and we will definitely be returning.",positive
Amazing beautiful place! I would definitely recommend this place:),positive
"Excellent breakfastVery professional staff, ready to help to get your preferred room if you already went at this hotel.",positive
"Private parking area, pretty much brand new building, modern but cozy and warm, tastefully decorated, very friendly owner.",positive
"The matrasses where to soft for me, but that's person related.,

Kind staff, good location to explore the city.",positive
"Nothing ,

Lovely welcome. Really clean and real attention to detail with the lovely breakfast. Thank you!",positive
"We especially liked our extra large suite, the luxurious and very fresh bedlinen and soft towels. Breakfast was outstanding: orangejuice, coffee, fresh fruit, all kinds of bread and rolls... We were especially surprised by the kind character and hospitality of Liesbeth.",positive
"Nothing to say,

Very close to the gare. A nice romatic getaway",positive
Staff ap friendly and Helpful. Thank you,positive
"The room setup was a bit strange with a double door, the separation of bathroom and room not ideal and some equipment not of great style.,

Great bed, a lot of space in the room and bathroom, free parking right on premises, snack bar 24/7 and free water in the room. The breakfast area is very pretty especially when the weather permits the terrace space and the breakfast itself is very good. Above all the staff was very friendly.",positive
Excellent breakfast,positive
"It was new, cozy, and the owner was a nice person.  The breakfast was amazing. Very good value!",positive
It needs to be more clean. But it is in an excellent location and the staff was very friendly!!!,negative
"Very small table - not really appropriate for work.,

Very friendly host. Very quiet over night.",positive
"A great private atmosphere, good facilities and the experience of nature and city perfectly united.",positive
"Broken shower and TV.,

The room was satisfactory apart from the bathroom. The hotel has also a nice restaurant which was probably the only place in town to eat in the evening. The staff was very friendly.",positive
"Very good location
cosy and spacious appartment
Very kind hostess",positive
"People are nice.
Wonderful room and cleanness.
Really easy to find!",positive
"Windows opened onto a deep light-well so little daylight. It took a very long time to draw hot water.,

Room comfortable and well equipped. Hotel was quiet (possibly for external reasons) and close to city attractions.",positive
"It was too dark in the room, old wooden floors.,

Small but cute room with a bathroom with whirlpool. Very nice and polite staff!",positive
"The WiFi is very bad :(,

It was very clean",positive
"Bed fabulous but very uncomfortable ( difficult to get in and out, very uncomfortable for sleeping ( you roll in the middle of it, too soft, it feels like a waterbed) Very nice linnen sheets, but a bit smelly for not being dried properly. Shower difficult to use. A modern one with a lot of gadgets, but really not necessary. When getting in, you get a bunch of cold water on your head plus cold water on your body from the sides. Feel horrible. The shower head almost useless ( just a bit of water comes out of it). When arrived and during the breakfast next they the host was calling, so we could hardly talk to each other and ask what we needed in a normal way. She could  pay more attention to her quests. Missed a Tv but for one night ok.,

Location, beautiful room",positive
"Noise from the lift during the night. Bright flashing red lights from the smoke detector. Heavy quilt, too hot.,

The swimming pool and sauna in the basement were a great place to relax! Very good breakfast with a wide choice. Helpful staff.",positive
Lovely B&B with excel.lent owner. All was very tidy and clean.,positive

"La Louviere not a pretty place.  Entry to car park very narrow, through building.,

Good Italian restaurant in the hotel.  Good level parking.",positive
"The bathroom can only be reached through the bedroom.,

It's in the heart of the city, fantastic location!",positive
"Door system didn't work at first, but Johan fixed it very quickly and we didn't have any problems after that.,

Lovely place, very clean and great facilities. Electric lock system meant we were free to arrive later in the evening.",positive
"Very clean and warm chalet. Friendly hosts willing to help and provide everything that is needed.Burning wood to keep the place warm (although there are more than enough electric heaters) gave the place an awsome atmosphere.",positive
"I loved it, brilliant location, sparkling clean, amazing minimal decor. Very comfy bed, amenities fabulous.",positive
"breakfast did not provide a lot of selection and was located in a dark room without windows;,

large conference hotel close to Brussels Noord station; very tidy and functionally equipped room; free coffee and water at the room; all necessities were available;",positive
"Super nice breakfast, keep it up. 
Thank you.",positive
"In the hot weather, a fan would have been a welcome addition",positive
"Attention to allergies, and experience in dealing with them.",positive

Clean and friendly",positive

Family home-like feeling",positive

I cant wait to come back to visit this lovely Bed And Breakfast. 
The host was so kind, lovely and she make the Best breakfast and coffee.",positive
"The airconditioning was too strong. The bedsheets were thin.   ,

The room was big.  Nice shower.",positive
"Doesn't have wifi,

The host was extremely accommodating and the apartment was quiet and comfortable with a good bathroom and a large kitchen area. Durbuy is a lovely town with so much to offer and the property location is fantastic.",positive
"Just everything from the location (city center but still no noise) and accessibility to the host Johan to the room itself. Perfect to stay alone or in couple. I have enjoyed my time here and will definitely come back. 
Tip: tell them the purpose of your stay and they’ll adjust to it and give tips.",positive
"The sleeping couch is in the living room and is a little bit noisy,

The location, the view and the wood interior makes it a beautiful place. Would highly recommend it",positive
"nothing to say,

Very well located, modern and good taste decorated, spacious, all facilities, clean. Good communication with the owner. Very good priced for its quality! Thank you!",positive
"none,

Room, location, breakfast - everything according to prior expectations.",positive
"Vicinity to train stationAttention to detailsStaff",positive
"Nothing,

Large comfortable rooms suited for double occupancy. Bed was very comfortable.
Quiet and serene",positive
The rooms were clean and cozy for a couple... a very good host with delicious breakfast. Was able to visit the nearby places easing car or also by foot.,positive
Alles was tiptop in orde,positive
"I really loved the accommodation. The lady who runs the place is very friendly. The rooms are in an old farm which has been renovated with much taste. The breakfast was very good. Although not far away from a rather busy street, the house is in a quite neighbourhood where you can sleep with an open window and in the morning enjoy the birds singing.",positive
"Taxi service has to be pre-ordered for morning journeys, hotel could make this clear in reception area, so guests are not caught out.,

Great location, right in the middle of historical Gent. Close to tram that goes to business Centre in Gent Zuid.Great breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. Staff are friendly and helpful. Preferred hotel for my business trips in Gent.",positive
"Pleasant welcoming owner, good breakfast.",positive
"Nothing.,

We liked everything - the room, the breakfasts, the hospitality.",positive
"A television with cable channels and not just a terrestrial aerial where the picture was un-watchable. I am sure many business travellers, like me, are keen to catch-up on the news and want to relax watching some entertainment programmes.,

The room was comfortable and clean. The staff on reception were extremely helpful.  I did not get chance to use all the facilities, such as the restaurant and breakfast, but there appeared to be a good atmosphere in the bar.",positive
Location,positive
"On the negative side: The bed was extremely soft and you roll together. The walls are thin, so I could hear other guests and their tv. However, we did book during May holidays so it was probably more expensive than usual.,

On the positive side: the location was very convenient, it is easy to access with a door code, and the owner was clear and communicative.",negative
"It was no problem for us, but it's handy to know that there isn't a separate bedroom. So, the bed is in the living room.,

Excellent location with a lot of privacy. The house is lovely and the view is perfect. Kind host, but only speaks French.",positive
"Needs wine and beer glasses and better hand towels.,

Location was perfect with great transport links. Lovely warm apartment. Spacious for three.",positive
"Unique style, and secret parking made my day",positive
"???,

Everything but especially home-made diner in self-service to be eaten in your room (Covid-19), and nice breakfast à la carte ordered by Internet.",positive
"The wifi is very patchy and prone to disconnects.,

The apartment comprises of a very large room on the top floor of an apartment house, with a bathroom shared with other tenants. It is in close proximity to a metro station as well as the Church of Our Lady of Laeken and the neighbourhood seems rather quiet (although there was some late-night roadworks happening on one of the nights I was staying there). Overall, the apartment offer excellent value and I would not hesitate to recommend it for a short stay.",positive
"This is a very special little cosy place. The breakfast was excellent. We want to thank the host for her kindness and hospitality. We booked it as the start of our hike along the GR571, which is a 20min walk away.",positive
"Hotel advertises they have parking, only when I got to the hotel I was told I had to book and I have to park in public car park 5 minutes away and pay 22 euros per day. It was quiet upsetting when I looked at the booking email and found it at the very bottom of long email I had to pre-book in advance, booked this hotel because it said has parking :(. Also hotel says is 4 stars, sorry but that’s not true, fairly 3 stars. Room needs a refurbishment, clean corridors and lift.,

Croissants was actually very nice, location very good.",negative
"Super friendly and flexible host
Brand new studio, clean and spacious
Huge breakfast!!",positive
"Pillows were not very comfortable. ,

A good hotel in a very central position. Very clean.",positive
"Nothing really as although I did not meet hosts personally we had a good communication channel via email,

Apartment is central close to venue. It is clean and the area is very quiet",positive
"The accommodation was gorgeous, straight out of Pinterest. Great decor, very spacious. Garden was lovely. Box hedges and manicured. The hostess  was gracious, warm and lovely. I would definitely stay there again.",positive
Nice food and excellent wine selection in the restaurant!,positive
very noisy,negative
Very comfortable place and specially the owner is very nice I have 4 days stay..,positive
"Cosy apartment, well connected to the city centre and institutions aerea via public transports.Owner very kind and available for info and clarifications.",positive
"Breakfast, Location, Size of the room.",positive
"The breakfast was good of course but why everything in mini, 1x mini pain au chocolat, 1x mini bun. Would be good to have a normal sized portion for the prize of the breakfast.
Having the mini bar next to my pillow prevented me from falling asleep easily as it gets noisy when it starts up,

Extremely well organised for covid with frozen meals in fridges, microwaves . Really impressive. Loved the jacuzzi bath too !",positive
"No curtains. Poor WiFi. No breakfast,

Comfortable bed",positive
"+location is central and off the beach front
+facilities (pool) and rooms are clean and cosy
+ nice breakfast and staff! Efficient and welcoming",positive
"There were 2 single beds + a sofa cum bed.... I'm just someone who personally prefers a king size bed.,

Probably the best B&B  I've seen; they are actually offering you a service apartment with almost a fully equipped & functional kitchen. The whole property is very tastefully furnished.",positive
"A bit noisy at night outside the window,

Great location and price with parking available and accommodated pet.",positive
"Everything was great.,

An incredibly cosy place really close to the European Quarter (where cosy accommodation is very hard to get). Everything has a friendly, colourful and human touch to it while it still remains trendy and clean. The owners are extremely lovely and nothing's ever a problem for them. The room had everything I could possibly need and was very peaceful. The breakfast was always a highlight of my day – beautifully presented, with so many great healthy and not-so-healthy options, combining organic and locally produced goodies with Belgian classics. This was my second time in B&B Place Jourdan and I hope to come back again.",positive
"-,

This b&b is something very Special. The house is situated right in the middle of huge Garden. The rooms are very big and cosy. I for example hat a bedroom and a seoerate living with a big desk for work. Great. Liesbeth the owner is very frindly and carring, she was still awake, eventhough I arrived at 10:30 pm. The breakfast is perfekt, fresh orange juice , fresh eggs and excelent Quality of Food. Ist really worth the Money Thank you Liesbeth",positive
"Breakfast was a bit limited, not included in the not very cheap price of the room. Water took very long to heat up in the shower, maybe because room was on the top floor but this was rather wasteful.,

Helpful and responsive staff. Room was quite a big apartment. Nice private parking despite being inbthe middle of the city.",positive
"Madam Christine was very helpful. Helped us to bring our car to the parking place and to bring our luggage. She explained everything about the apartment and the city itself. With her hospitality and kindness we felt like at home. The apartment is located in the very centrer of the city, it is big enough to accommodate 4 people (two adults and two kids). Very specious bedroom. Apartment very clean. The kitchen was fully equipped. We spend there very pleasant time.",positive
"Location, facilities and everything was good. Johan and his co-host were nice and excellent at communication.",positive
"The property is spacious, clean, fully equipped and closed to public transport to the inner town.",positive
"Pillows need review.,

Great place which i always consider as top choice, great breakfast and fantastic staff",positive
"Nothing,

Very easy check-in (nobody at reception, but instructions were given via email and were very clear). The room was very clean, beautiful bathroom with rituals soap. The new windows blocked out the noise of  the trains. 
Thanks to the foodcorner we had a very nice dinner (Lasagna and ice cream), and breakfast in the room was also very good (large choice available).
Would love to go again :)",positive
"Paying for everything up front in cash was a little inconvenient,  would have preferred card payment option,

Very big room,  comfortable bed, Belgian beer on arrival.",positive
"Best of everything in the center of the town, short stroll to the beach and shopping around the corner.
Staff is professional and very friendly.
Best breakfast and nice dining.",positive
"Absolutely nothing,

Even though the program fell down the whole day, the desk manager did everything to have a fluid check in check out for all the visitors waiting. Great person!",positive
"the lighting in room - I would prefer more / stronger,

amazingly comfortable and big bedpleasant atmosphere at breakfast thanks to the room and music, the offer was of everything and there were instructions at wall (e.g. to boil the egg) owners ready to help really close to Place Jourdan",positive
Liesbeth was a most amazing host. Lovely person and incredible premises she has on offer. Truly enjoyed the stay.,positive
"The entrance to the hotel's private parking is very narrow, even for a small car. After having been on the road for 5 hours due to a massive traffic jam on the highways around Lille, I was tired, and I sustained some damage to my car on the side of the entrance as I was driving into the parking terrein. Examination of the entrance shows many traces of where other cars have scraped against the sides of the entrance, so it is evident that other motorists have sustained damage to their cars on this entrance. Parking on the street in front of the hotel is possible though, but it is not free, and as it is a fairly busy street, there is thus no assurance that a parked car will not be damaged there either.,

The restaurant served good food, at reasonable prices. The staff were friendly and did their best to accommodate, in spite of the language barrier. However, there were a couple of staff members who did speak reasonable enough English to facilitate communication. Room was clean and comfortable.",positive
"Very central, and easy parking location.
Very helpful , easy check in. Recomend if staying at Durbuy
Thanks again",positive
"Sorting out the bin bags was not straight forward. The picture on the booklet is not very clear. Location is 20 mins walk from the city centre.,

Perfect size one-bedroom apartment. Plenty of lights with big french windows (ceiling to floor) which allows the light to brighten up the flat. I wish I asked the host if we could open them to allow some fresh air in.",negative
"Noise level at night. Room was overlooking the street.,

The hotel was located near the tram station and was walking distance to the grand place. Very convenient. 
Room was big and comfortable.",positive
"small cleaning issues, in cupboard you could see someone didnt clean for a while. one small issue, lack of toilet paper( funny, but we received the room with last "" pieces"".. could be nice to have another roll on the side.,

nice place, quiet, with small terrace, was exactly what we needed",positive
"Despite having a fridge and microwave there were no plates or cutlery to use with the microwave! If you stay in the room facing the road beware it can be incredibly noisy. The tram passes right under your window and as the Brico is just round the corner, the delivery entrance is about 6 doors away and so you can imagine the noise you get from delivery lorries at 04.00. Plus of course rubbish collection at 02.00 and all the other deliveries for the shops and restaurants and the rattle and ding ding of the tram until about midnight!! Also, maybe a glitch, but the WiFi didn’t work at all well for my stay.,

The host was lovely. The accommodation is a large room with a high ceiling. Fridge and microwave in the room, with a table to eat at. Comfy bed, lots of windows and a nice sofa with cushions to lounge on. Nicely decorated and very clean.",negative
"the international standard of everything, the lobby like a passage to nowhere, the bedroom so grey, the invisibility of the sea so close, and the too high price.,

the little swimming pool",negative
"You could hear morning noise from the street and from the room above. Pillows way to hard but in their defense I didn't ask for different ones so not sure if they had better ones. ,

Amazing location right in the center of Ghent. Restaurants bars and shopping less than 5 minutes walk. Tram to get back to train station very close by.",positive
"Although the Etterbeek neighborhood is great, this place is a wee bit too far from the metro stations if you need to get around by public transport. Plus, the host persuaded us not to have breakfast (saving 40€ althogether, though), while other guests could have it.,

My son said that the upstairs apartment – where we were put up – is like a ""den"" but in a good way. We really had our little place, with a kitchen, great sitting spaces, and even a selection of DVDs. The good thing about the location is that there are some great cafés, restaurants close by, as well as a Sunday market on Place Jourdan. (We chose the location for Autoworld in Parc Cinquantenaire.)",positive
"No complaints! I’ll stay here again !,

Felt as if I was back home. Never seen such empathetic service in any hotel. God bless the family running this place.....may it get more & more visitors",positive
"The bed and pillows,

Pleasantly surprised as the surrounding area is very working class and drab.",positive
"Amazing location-literally right in the centre and overlooking lovely back streets of the lovely Durbuy. 
Christine was super helpful and kind.",positive
"Unfortunately style impacted on practical use such as bathroom and no windows. Communication was not proactive by host.,

Great location. Large apartment. Very stylish.",positive
"nothing worth writing about - not much to critique,

quiet room, satisfying breakfast with a reasonable choice of food and drinks, excellent wifi, good coffee making facilities in room",positive
Covid-preparedness was very good. Frozen meals for dinner is a very good idea when restaurants are getting closed.,positive
"Room on the top floor, there was no Wi-Fi, the mattress is very soft, the body collapses like a hammock. Noise outside the window and mosquitoes at night. Couldn't sleep.  The room has no refrigerator or at least a kettle.,

The only thing is the reception of a friendly young girl who helped with the search for some information.",negative
"Pool could be better cleaned,

Excellent service, friendly receptionist, exceptionally good variety breakfast, close to everything in city centre, i.e., shopping, beach, restaurants, pleasant pool",positive
"The hotel was very child friendly. Staff gave our kids little toys and they were very happy.  The room was cozy and we all liked it. Breakfast was very good, everyone ate something they like. While we are eating kids could play at the playing area. Thanks for everything",positive
"Personable, helpful hosts, easy check-in, great breakfast, newer plumbing fixtures (modern and easy to use), cool decor, great selection of books on Brussels to browse, quiet street near the Cinquantenaire Park and EU area.",positive
Super cosy and clean!,positive
"We knew there was no breakfast, but they could have made a little effort providing a kettle and two cups for some instant coffee in the morning. They changed the sheets only once in the week. Towels were changed every day, but some were really old and thin. Plastic glasses were provided only twice. The shower floor was terribly slippery and slopy. Pillows were awful, my neck is still complaining. And last but not least, we had to pay as we arrived, in advance, the very first evening.,

The wifi conexión and the air-co.",negative
It is an old house but the location is excellent. Perfect for a short stay.,positive
"Very nice and modern flat with all comforts. Open space but with the right privacy between the rooms, it's ideal for friends or couple.  Very clean. The position is convenient, near the wonderful Horta's museum and houses. Well connected with the city centre. In few words really comfortable!",positive
It was my boyfriend’s birthday and we were given a complimentary room upgrade .,positive
"I really appreciated the different dinner alternatives once got to the hotel. It was not supposed to be but in this covid time, they set up a small food court.",positive
"As a frequent traveler, it was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had with booking.com. The room was cold in late December and although my booking included heater, the owner refused to turn it on and told me I could change my reservation if I was cold! She also tried to stopped me to use the bathroom on my checkout saying that she had already cleaned it! Apart from the disrespectful behavior of the owner, the shared toilet was so dirty. The WiFi was poor and not work at second floor. I had to walk many steps down (these steps were also another issue!) to get some poor signal. It is not value for money at all. I honestly believe such an awful property should never be listed in booking.com.,

The room was clean and beds were comfortable",negative
"It wasn’t clean, there was mold, rust and generally in need of repairs & deep-cleaning.",negative
"Only small complaint was the pillows on the bed, one very flat, one very high, just needed something more in the middle ground.,

Location is perfect for everything you want to see and do in Ghent, the staff were brilliant as well.",positive
"Less strairs!,

3rd or 4th visit, just right for my purposes.",positive
"Air conditioner varely working. Noisy Place. Could not sleep very well. Many details in the room. The lady in the reception outstandings. She makes de difference. ,

The hotel staff",negative
"Friendly hosts, comfortable stay, amazing location",positive
The toilet door was just a thin glass without any isolation. My boyfriend and I could not use the toilet because of that reason (hope you can understand what I mean). We had to use a toilet outside of the hotel.,negative
"Super friendly hotel, very good breakfast, nice and clean rooms, amazing bathroom. Would definitely recommend!",positive
"The bath tab was super dirty. SO I CLEANED UP!!,

I liked the landscape at night. Can oversee the atomium far away.",negative
"Hotel,

Breakfast",negative
"Beds were a little hard and the pull out sofa bed was not comfortable at all. However, the amenities in the room were adequate and fine for a short stay.,

Perfect location in the heart of Ghent. Food options abundant immediately surrounding to make up for a rather pricey breakfast option. Super fun lobby with a foosball table and interactive video gaming system.",positive
"It is perfectly located, near to European institutions. The owners are really nice, friendly and helpful. Breakfast is amazing, better than 5 stars hotels. The room in well equipped, new and clean and the bathroom has a lot of space, big shower. Definitively the best option in Brussels.",positive
"The entrance to the parking is extremely narrow; I had some problems to avoid scratching the car. Personally I needed some guidance to go straight. So, not suitable for big cars.,

Normal size room, clean, quiet (as on the back of the property). Eager to help receptionist, she explained calmly all the issues. The access to the room and main entrance is done with a code, should keep it with you if not memorize it.",negative
"n/a,

Fantastic stay at this hotel and even got a lovely upgrade that we didn't expect too! Wish every city had a hotel as good this one.",positive
"We knew that before, so it is not really a dislike but the property is relatively far away from the city center. If you want to walk it will take about 30 minutes.,

Very friendly staff, good parking possibilities, very clean rooms. And as a little bonus surprise the mini bar was free :)",positive
"Unfortunately parking was only free from 6pm to 9am. After that only 2h parking so if you want to spend the day in the city you need to find another parking space which is quite expensive in Brussels. ,

Very friendly owner, spacious and beautifully decorated room, bathroom was very clean. Free coffee and tea, very good WiFi.",positive
"Bathroom equipment of poor quality,  reception personnel has a  lack of qualification,

Breakfast, comfort in the room,quiet place",positive
"The breakfast was expensive for a buffet breakfast, but as it was New Year there were limited alternatives.",positive
"The eindow curtins did not block the light. For people that do not sleep with ligh, is dificult,

Excelent. The place is perfet, the size of the rrom ans bathroom, the localisation and breakfast are great!!",positive
"bathroom ... took about 5 minutes before to get hot water in the shower... if we can call this hot.. oh, and be careful with the bed... you can hurt yourself by bumping your legs into the bed structure which sticks out of the mattress. I have a big bruise on my tibia today -_-',

Good breakfast, staff very nice, outside good looking, dedicated parking lot secured via dedicated code.Even if a bit far away from Mons, this hotel gives you an easy access to the Mons city, which is very saturated in term of traffic. This is a very good point.",negative
Staff welcoming and helpful the facility himself and the location,positive
"The staff were exceptional, making our stay eas and comfortable.",positive
"but there was not a table, where I could sit with a PC and it was cold,

The room has a nice view to the Atomium,",negative
"I had trouble sleeping because of noises on the street,

good location, spacious room, good beds, good breakfast, friendly personnel",positive
"Price for breakfast ,

Location",positive
"perfect location in center, very helpful owners, comfort",positive
"Staff stayed chatting while I was try to pay for breakfast and leave,

The room was set out nicely with a comfy bed, the location was in an easy to get to area and breakfast was buffet with plenty of options.",positive
"Modern, great staff, Netflix in our suite",positive
"price  is enormous, location near station not that interesting as Dampoort   is nearer the centre and nearer  Holland as well,

friendly staff, nice breakfast",positive
"A great place to stay in. The room has enough space. Shops, dinner or other facilities just around the corner. Walking distance to the park and Gare du Nord.",positive
"Despite the publication and price range this Is 4* is unworthy.
Hotel is completely outdated and in need of renovation.
Upon arrival the room was not cleaned, fingerprints and hairs of the previous hotel guests were abundant, and this during covid period.
The bathroom was completely worn, mold spots in and around the shower and sink, stains on walls and ceilings, taps worn, rusted and completely calcified. Windows hadn't been cleaned for weeks, the handles were literally black with dirt.
The renovation work already carried out looked more like amateurish bricolage than thorough renovation (laminate simply laid over the old fitted carpet, holes in the walls for extra cabling).
When reported to the counter, the friendliness of the staff quickly deteriorated. A cleaning lady was sent on the spot who apparently lacked a special product (= Antical). Unfortunately she was only in possession of a spray with Javel but would certainly report this to the 'Manager'. A good morning from the staff turned out to be no longer an option. However, the hotel apparently has a rather high reputation when it comes to friendliness of the staff.
Despite the multiple positive scores for breakfast, this was also a disappointment.
A very classic and standard breakfast was offered 'corona proof', but if you wanted a glass of cava, each guest had to take the same bottles to pour themselves during covid. Moreover, the waiter on duty didn't speak the Dutch language. The dining room turned out not to be cleaned either, dust and food remains of previous guests were easily spotted.
This is the first time in 20 years that I am writing a review. However, I have never had such a negative experience (not even in countries where the stars are awarded 'smoother').
Any self-respecting 4* hotel would notice these things for themselves and take action here.
Be warned before booking your overpriced room here.",negative
"I think the price was too high for a 3 stars hotel, even though the hotel provides more than a 3 stars service. My room faced the construction sites of the Town Hall, resulting in scarce natural light from the window and some noise from workers starting at 7am. The staff at the reception didn't inform me at all about the spa and the gym which are shown in the pictures and of which I was not aware. I would have liked to know that.,

I spent 3 nights at Novotel during a business trip in Ghent. The hotel was chosen because recommended by my local partner and because of its convenient location in the city centre and close to the university and all amenities, including public transportation from/to the train station. The room was enourmous, clean and confortable. High quality sleep. Nice hotel staff.",positive
"Många trappor,

Everything was super!!",positive
"Upon arrival at the room after check-in, the air conditioning did not work, the wifi either and the small existing refrigerator did not either. I mentioned it to the reception but they could not give any solution, I had to use a personal network cable to connect to a wall socket and thus be able to have internet. Towards an unbearable heat and with the air conditioning not working could not be in the room, for which I had to open the balcony doors throughout the night, resulting in the entry of mosquitoes that ""fried"" me to bites all the night. I do not find it acceptable, that having booked a suite, upon arrival there will not work main services such as air conditioning and wifi. These things should be checked before offering the room in web portals. The direction of the hotel the first night remained totally passive, and did not react until the next day. To my understanding too late. Any excuse then does not solve anything.,

Friendly staff, but not too resolutive facing incidents. The existing restaurant has a varied menu of elaborate dishes. Existence of a park in the facilities, although yes, to get to it has to go through a door and a fairly narrow corridor, be careful with it.",negative
"Very well looked after, last year we booked this hotel and unfortunately last minute couldn’t make it and the free cancellation had passed, we were promised an upgrade for free and they did not disappoint. Very good value for money and excellent location",positive
"Everything was excellent, thank you everybody, I will definitivelly come back",positive
"Beautiful and very spatious room, very friendly owners",positive
"The hotel has been recently renovated but in our room there were many things that were not in top shape - bathroom door could not be closed and handle was falling off. The mattress was not comfortable it was very thin. The hotel is located in a pedestrian zone so you cannot access it directly by car which makes it difficult to unload and load your car, especially challenging when you have a small child with you.,

Great location very close to the beach and shopping streets. Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby as well.Very friendly and attentive staff. The breakfast was good many things to choose from.",negative
"Carpark was tiny. Spaces were very small and entrance to get in was very tight. If you have a large car it's hard work. Quite difficult to find too, had to drive down the high street to get to the carpark. Not ideal if you're driving to the hotel and need parking. Bar is quite expensive too.,

Lovely hotel, lovely people. Right in the middle of things.",positive
"The only small thing is that is a 3rd floor with no lift, something common in these buildings.,

Super helpful owner, very clean, comfy bed and great location.",positive
"The Receptionist was friendly and helpful and spoke English. Room was small but very modern, cozy and clean. Breakfast fad a great variety of items to choose from and good coffee. Private parking was much appreciated. We would stay again and gladly recommend this hotel.",positive
"Colour scheme was very dull; brown and dark brown with grey. A few colourful cushions or bedspread would have cheered the place up.,

Close to metro and centre of city. The room was quite large and had a superb bathroom with large bath and separate shower. Big desk. Large comfortable bed.",positive
"-,

Really friendly and helpful staff; super excellent breakfast in a lovely setting (home made-made jams, granola, yoghurt, etc.) with good coffee brewed by the cup; everything I needed/wanted in my room; easy walk from train station. I loved this place.",positive
"Right away when manager heard that i'm coming 11pm. He said it charged 30€ extra if i come later than 8 o'clock. There were no mentions on a booking page that they have this kind of arrangement. So i change my train tickets and trying to get there before eight (didn't want to pay 40%extra). My bus from Holland was over hour late,so i missed about 20 minutes from my check-in time.
Which i heard first time six hours earlier, still they demand extra payment.
Wifi didn't work on upstairs, work poorly on down floors.
They didn't even gave my small change back to me when i paid,

Location was only good thing",negative
Alles was in orde.,positive
"Rooms in need of an update- shower room basic. It would also be nice to have bigger family rooms (e.g. twin beds for older children, duvet rather than thin blankets).,

Fantastic location with car park.",negative
"My room was quite dusty, so it didn't feel very clean. It was a very sunny day when I arrived and when I sat on the bed a cloud of dust went up. The stairs to the top floors are very narrow and steep. Which is fine but a bit inconvenient when carrying a suitcase.,

I really like the location, close to Jourdan (cool bars and places to eat) and also close to the EU district, which was great for me, because I was travelling for work. The owners were nice, very kind. The breakfast was great! Offered in a very speical way as well :)Comfy bed.",positive
Excellent breakfast! Nice and confy rooms!,positive
"Pillows could have been bigger.,

Big bed!!",positive
"WiFi connection was weak. Could only connect when I am nearer the corridor.,

Although the hotel is next to the train track, we could hardly hear the train. Good soundproofing.We were surprised that they provided 5 complimentary bottles of drinks every day. - Coke, lemonade, beers and 2 water. :)Friendly and helpful staffBest of the 5 hotels I stayed in this trip !",positive

Friendly helpful staff, a very nice restaurant with delicious food and a bar with every type of beer imaginable.",negative
"Very friendly and helpful staff 
Exceptional breakfast 
Outside the new Low Émissions Zone with easy on site parking- so very car friendly. But also a five minute walk from the main station",positive
"The timing they give you, and they make you adapt to their last-hour issues.,

I needed to pay in the house directly and not thorugh Booking, and they didn't accept card payments. Also we had scheduled the checkin at 15h and once there they told me to come back at 20h. This is not acceptable.",negative

Nice, very quite location, clean and tidy room, friendly people running the hotel. A restaurant downstairs serves delicious food, the service is very nice and friendly.",positive
Smell from the bathroom.,positive
"I can't see room for improvement.,

All round very good. The room was well decorated, comfortable and spotlessly clean (the bathroom in particular was immaculate) and had a little kettle with tea and coffee. You don't get this in France, so we were especially pleased to see that you do in Gent! The hotel is well-situated for the Art Museum, and the city centre is a manageable half-hour walk away. Car parking is paying, but with lots of room for any size of car. Finally, the Northern European style breakfast was excellent, with a fantastic selection of cheese, sausage, different kinds of bread, viennoiseries, teas and so on. All in all, a delightful stay which ended too soon.",positive
"It's not a hotel.. it's like rooms in a big house and they all use the same toilet... no heat in the rooms.. it's December ,cold and rainy and there's no heat ..couldn't even dry out my clothes",negative

Very clean and very close to the city centre. Very good breakfast,positive
"There was noisy refurbishment happening in several rooms, and the workers started at around 8am which felt a bit early given we were on holiday. The breakfast options weren’t that plentiful, we had to ask for more stuff several times.,

Recently refurbished rooms, done to a really high standard. The staff were very friendly and talked us through how to get around Ghent, and offered bike rental at the hotel. The breakfast options were tasty.",positive
"No lighting in the corridor at all, all dark. Very bad location, overall a very bad place to stay and no value for money at all.,

Nothing,literally nothing.",negative
"I selected this hotel mainly because of the sauna. But it wasn't working, which was disappointing...,

The location is excellent. Great breakfast, with good variety.",positive

"Amazing location, very cute and characterful bedrooms Japanese’s style. Very centrally located. What a brilliant stay I would highly recommend! Thank you so much.",positive
"The overal cleaniness was only average. the bathroom was in general clean, but the sink was stained, despite seemingly refurbished recently. The carpet also had dark stains behind the bed towards the window. The carpet tiles are easy to remove, so I wonder why this is not done?",positive

Location was excellent and value for money (for the price I paid because it could be that at other periods of the year the price is more expensive",positive

Beautifully served buffet breakfast. No noise from the railways, despite the location. Nice staff, pretty room.",positive

I stayed there during the heatwave - having a fan in the room would have helped.,

The lady helped me with my suitcase all the way to the 2nd floor.",positive
"Cheaper breakfast,

Been many times always good",positive
"The area to have breakfast is really small so if there are more people who want to have breakfast at the same time, it might be a little bit crowded: there are only two small tables.,

The bed was very comfortable and large and the room spacious and very clean. The breakfast was also great because the owner brings fresh bred and croissants every morning.",positive
"No issues,

Great location, immaculate and well situated for road links and transport",positive
Super location and very friendly staff..,positive

"Big and comfortable house, with very nice garden, close to shops and the beach.",positive

Nice hotel, standard rooms and service",positive

Also, inclusive mini-bar was very welcome, thank you!!",positive
"Close to metro,

If you like invents then it’s not to bad",negative
Everything was perfcet,positive
"There is an elevator available but it is extremely small.,

The location was fantastic, we were right in the middle of all these great restaurants and close to a lot of attractions! It was also a very nice quirky stay - you enter through the owner's bubble tea shop and go to the rooms by the elevator in the back and emerge into a Japanese style room. It was a lovely room, very minimalistic with cute Japanese details like the paper doors and beds on a raised floor, and I totally loved it. The stained windows in the room also added a really nice romantic touch to the room and city view.",positive

Location close to the kinepolis a movie theatre, restaurants are available there.",positive

"Nothing.,

Very attractively converted byre with original features (eg vaulted ceilings). Comfortable beds, great shower and good cooking facilities. There's a nearby bus stop for travel into Namur. Christine could not have been more welcoming, and gave us lots of ideas for places to eat and drink in the city. Beer enthusiasts should sample the huge selection at Barnabeer in Rue de Bruxelles!",positive
"Very nice, large bungalow  in quiet residental area. Very close to beach. Ideal for family holiday.",positive
Bed was great and it was very quiet,positive
Exceptional service and excellent facilities! Super cute rooms and good quality breakfast. Loved that you could hire bikes easily for the day for a reasonable price!,positive
"The environment felt unsafe for  going out in the evening.
The bedsheet was dark brown instead of white. This made me concerned if the bed linen was freshly washed.
Contrary to the online feedback, that the host is nice and homely, I only saw the host once and that is when I arrived, so I didn't know where was the kitchen, where to get drinking water, or ask general questions.
The instructions on where to pick the keys from was not clear, so I spent 1 hour roaming around the street, looking for internet access to connect with the host so as to get the keys.
It would be great, if you place next to the coffee marker, instructions on how to use it. 
The internet strength upstairs was poor, so I had to leave my room to make whatsapp calls. 
,

The presence of a coffee marker (although it would have been great if it was filled with water).
Coffee was replaced the following day.",negative

The cottage was immaculate and very big!  We met the host and felt right at home!  The kitchen and laundry room were perfect for us!  The bedrooms were all comfortable and very large.  We enjoyed the neighbor hood and talked to people locally and everyone was very friendly. We will definitely be back!,positive
very friendly host and very clean room in a quiet location near to Namur,positive
"Our room was nice but felt like it was an after though during construction. We were located past the fire exit stays and near the staff lift. This meant most mornings we had to squeeze past the maids trolley. We had to move the trolley on check out to make room for our luggage.
We found tiny worms/ maggots in our bathroom near a hole at the base of the shower. Wasn’t pleasant.
The breakfast was good but the selection of hot food was limited but creamy mushrooms seemed to be a thing.
I wouldn’t say it was 4 stars 
,

It was easy to get to when coming from the main eurostar station.
The room was spacious.
Fresh bread at breakfast was delicious.",positive
"Nothing,

Breakfast was excellent. Location, fairly close to Gent-St Pieters station was ideal. View from my window of the railway, s a railway fan, was excellent.Info provided by reception regarding the beautiful city, and getting to the football ground, was excellent.Would stay there again if I return to Gent.And there were tea and coffee making facilities in the room, not a given in continental Europe.",positive
"Loved the view over the river from the bed! Breakfast was so good & very healthy, comfortable bed and great bathroom - the photos don’t do it justice.  A great place to stay and a lovely walk along the river into Kortrijk for lunch - Highly recommended",positive
Everything was perfect,positive
The bathroom it was huge,positive
"No kettle in room, room was cold but this was my fault as I left the balcony door open..,

Bed and shower ok, similar price to ibis budget but beds here are better and balcony a nice touch. Check in guy was friendly",positive
"It’s a lovely house with the best owner ever. Christine welcomed us with a bottle of wine and was very kind and helpful during all our stay. I have forgotten my mobile at the apartment and Christine kindly sent it to Russia.

"I usually don't like to spend time rating hotels. However, this place left me with such a great memory that I feel it is necessary to share my view with others.This one bed house is so beautifully decorated and the bed is extremely comfortable. Host was very nice and we were even given a free bottle of red wine, which was amazing! One of the best place I have ever stayed at!!! Definitely recommend to anyone who is staying near Namur.",positive

"There was nothing we didn't like. A microwave in the kitchen would have been useful for us, but the hosts were happy to heat anything up we needed.,

Nadine and Claude were so helpful and welcoming hosts. Quiet location and comfortable beds made for a good night's sleep. The breakfast was an excellent mix of fresh fruit, yogurt, rolls and a platter of cold meats and cheeses.",positive
"There was four of us and we had booked a three bedroom apartment but was told this was not available on arrival. We were given two double rooms which impacted on our stay as we had to share rooms. The hotel blamed booking.com but we doubt this was correct. If the hotel can not provide the accommodation booked they should not be listing on booking.com. We did not feel over welcomed. The reception area is the same area as the restaurant counter area which is strange.,

Continental breakfast was very good Rooms clean and tidy. Location was excellent for what we wanted. Most of the staff were excellent. Restaurant was very popular",positive
"Hotel is too warm, also in the room difficult to get temperature down.Second morning there was no hot water (first time this happened in 5 stays).,

Good location, good breakfast, very nice lobby with free coffee/tea/water",positive
"Perhaps some shampoo and shower gel would have been good. We didn't like leaving.,

Christine is such a lovely lady and she speaks English which was a huge bonus for those of us who do not speak French! The converted barn has been so beautifully renovated and was so cosy and warm. The bed was super comfortable, the shower superb, and we felt completely rested after our two night mid winter stay.",positive

"All OK,

Overall very good",positive
"The elevator wasn't working when I stayed. Also, it must be due to the weather, but I had a hard time sleeping because it was kind of warm. Solved the problem by leaving the balcony door open. Also, TV was not working during stay.,

Unfortunately, I did not eat breakfast. However, they do offer tea/drinks near the reception.",negative

Excellent welcome from owner even though our crossing delayed us 3 hours!",positive
"Nothing!!,

The house is outstanding as a B&BLocation, hosts the welcome, breakfast, house itself.  Everything was exceptionally good.A walk through a woodland path leads into Bessegem which has VG eating places and excellent transport connections.The house is a modern build and is on the river over which there are excellent views.  You can watch the barges glide quietly by.  If you wish the dawn can fill your room with light",positive

ok",positive
"The drilling machine should not run in other room so early....,

it was quite ok",positive
"- the fact the part of the garden we were allowed to use was not really private (it was just beside the parking lot)- the bigger garden (the one with the view) was not open to us as guests as the robot mower was cutting the grass (we were told) -> we were surprised to see the already very short grass needed to be cut extra short 24/7- the doors to the bathroom and bedroom didn't close (1 couldn't be closed, the other only when pushed real hard and with lots of noise) which woke our 1 yar old daughter up- the rooms were quite chilly, even in warm weather (due to the thick walls) + due to the thick walls also quite dark- the house isn't fit for young children: the plates and other delicate stuff were placed in an open cabinet so it was easy for our baby to grasp and break things -> we had to put everything higher so she couldn't reach all of these things & there was no high chair for us to use,

+ lots of utensils ready for use in the kitchen + spacious house+ the garden chairs we were able to use + village was really quiet+ great shower+ tasty bottle of wine given to us by the host upon arrival + warm welcome by the host",negative

Acoustic isolation is very bad. So, if you are sensible to noise...,

Flemish chic feeling.",positive

"The bathrooms are very nice, but the design of the shower is poor.  Although very clean and spacious, the water leaks out.  The towel mat on the floor would be soaked with water.  Not a reason to not stay here, but just some feedback.,

The location was great.  Only a 10 minute walk to the train station, which was nice, as we visited many other areas throughout our stay.  Easy to find with free map you can get at train station ticket area, as it is a hotel actually listed on the map.   Also, the neighborhood was nice - felt safe walking back at night.A bank to get cash was a short walk away, too.  It is decent walk to city center, but there is a tram.  We enjoyed the walk, so not an issue for us.  The room was spacious and very clean.  Loved the fact that you can open the window, especially after a shower to let out the steam and get some fresh air.  Train nearby was NOT an issue.   Very quiet.  Lovely grounds.  Hotel is being renovated, but not an issue.  Management did a great job working this. Would recommend this hotel and would stay again.",positive

The owners were very nice and made sure we had everything we needed, they even took us to the train station when we missed our bus. They will be seeing us again next year!",positive

Simple and fuss free.",negative

"What I liked? Well... This ise easy - EVERYTHING! The hostess was so welcoming that we felt like we stayd in our friend's house.

Great location for the station. Lovely area to stroll around.Quiet location, noise from the trains nearby was inaudible if windows closed, but not if windows open.

"Shared bathroom,

This B&B is clearly a labour of love. Sharon is a top-notch host, and one of the sweetest, most caring and sincere owners of a B&B we have met. The exceptionally well maintained and attention is paid to every detail for your experience.   The location, about an 8 min cycle into historical Diest is perfect if you are travelling by bike. There is also a great little grocery store a few minutes walk away if you need any provisions. Water, tea, coffee, milk (for your tea or coffee) and beer are all available for you in the kitchen and Sharon asks you to make yourself at home. There were even chocolates on the bed when we arrived in our room.  The only downside is that there is a shared bathroom, not an issue during our visit since we were the only guests that night but not something we noticed when we booked and something that we usually avoid. Sharon has gone to efforts to make this work with robes in each room for guests transiting to and from the facilities, an ‘in use or available’ sign on the door and space for storage of toiletries etc assigned for each room in the bathroom.Breakfast was excellent with the same attention paid to detail as in all other aspects of our stay.",positive

"The Hotel was called the Antwerp Harbour Hotel there wasn’t a Harbour insight The hotel was situated on a 11 road network and the volume of traffic night and day was alarming!! The noise of the traffic the trucks that sounded their horns and travelled at high speeds throughout the night made our stay very uncomfortable. Crossing the road took 5 mins or more because of the tramlines and the roads. This hotel is not suitable for families.THERE WAS NO AIR CONDITIONING of any kind in any of the rooms in the hotel and considering the temperature was in the late 30s some days  it was unbearably hot in the hotel.All this spoilt our stay.,

The staff were excellent so helpful The breakfast was better than the average continental The rooms were very clean and the cleaners very friendly The communal rooms were excellent Free coffee and free chilled water were excellent features of the service the hotel provided Free table tennis and the  free pool table  were excellent facilities for  relaxation as was the communal TV area. Our stay at the hotel was fairly priced",positive
"Only one thing may decrease score for this apartment. It is that you have not view from your window. But if it’s not point for you It would be great place for stay. ,

Really clean and comfortable apartment with modern design. They give you full set of kitchen stuff that all clean or new. 
Another good news is supermarket in the next building with working hours 8/9-23 and cafe. But we didn’t visit cafe only looked at menu and it seemed interesting.",positive

Really comfortable and clean room, nice shower. Friendly and professional staff. Good price for everything it offers, especially the astonishing location.",positive
"The mattress can feel very soft to some. I normally don’t like soft mattresses but I slept like a baby on that one. Beware that the hotel is close to a train station (earplugs provided), but otherwise very quiet.,

very close to the center, friendly staffs, satisfactory breakfast with a waffle machine(no Omelet though), Superior Double Room is a quite spacious for two persons with excellent cleanliness.",positive

"I am not 100% satisfied with cleanliness in the rooms. For example, lots of dust were below the bed and on the decorative elements hanging on walls. 
We had two rooms: one of the was staffed with bathrobes and slippers, another - not. In one room we found tea packets, in another - didn’t. ,

Thanks to Marivaux Hotel! 
We did like spacious rooms, stuffed with everything needed from free coffee and tea and tea pot to bathrobes and slippers. Supreme breakfasts! Very special and important point for me. Very nice hotel staff, I had a lot of questions and requests - always was satisfied. The Hotel has its own parking and it costs 20 Euro / night. We prolonged checkout time till 13:00 and it costed us 20 Euro. We also asked a baby cot in advance, then decided to refuse from it - hotel staff did it immediately upon request.",positive

But staffs did nothing and even no answer to my email about the WiFi problem, if like this, I think they should not say they have WiFi.And the room rate should be recalculated.And the staff is not so friendly, while I was asking for a wine opener. I can not understand that a restaurant have no wine opener!",negative

"Policy changes. I arrived at the hotel at 11.30am on a saturday and officially the room is available as from 2pm. On previous visits I never had any issue especially as on weekends the hotel is mostly not full. Now also I estimate occupancy on saturday at 60%. The rooms were already cleaned and ready, yet a new staff member asked me to pay 30 euros for advance occupancy of the room (so for about 2 hours)... They had never done this before. Only when I insisted that I always stay at this hotel when in Belgium did they allow me in the room.  Also the parking is no longer free and is now 12 euros a day... These fee additions no longer make  Ibis the best deal in town. Other hotels come close and should be considered.,

Breakfast is great and some of the longer-term staff recognize and appreciate repeat business and are very friendly",positive

We got a bigger room than we had expected. Everything was really fine, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. They even let us leave our luggage in the reception after check-out. Everybody was very friendly.",positive

Alles was in orde",positive

Sunday, my wife and I checked in in the Alfa inn hotel in Blankenberge. Is already our second stay there. Rooms weren’t ready because we were early, immediately we got an upgrade to another very beautiful room. Wow!! What a room. Amazing. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and kind. The next surprise is the breakfast basket. I am a big eater, but we had to struggle to enjoy it all. Thank you, you have 3 stars, but this place surely deserves 5 stars. We will be back!!!!
To the staff of the Alfa inn hotel. Two thumbs up 👍👍
So if you ever wanna stay at Blankenberge. One place to go overnight. The Alfa inn hotel ♥️",positive

the facilities and the location",positive
"The room we stayed in was not quite as well maintained as the other areas of the hotel but this was only minor - it would not stop me from staying here again.,

The hotel reception, restaurants, and bar area were all well maintained. Breakfast was a pretty good buffet with a choice of hot and cold food. The room we stayed in was comfortable. The hotel is in a fantastic location with a lot of good bars and restaurants seconds away.",positive

Very good breakfast!! 
Staff very friendly!! 
Would definitely come back",positive

Easy to park before the house and free parking available within 10 minutes walk. The city center is very close, within 10 min walking distance. The host, Tatjana was very helpful and was happy to assist in case of any questions, available as well by phone through the whole day. We will definitely come back in Christmas time for another weekend :)",positive
"I don't have any complain about this place.,

This is not a hotel but an airbnb type apartment, but it was very good. We were three people (my girlfriend and her friend and me) and we had two separate rooms: one in the first floor and another in the second floor. Both are spacious. The entire apartment was very clean. The owner was very nice and helpful. I would stay here when I have a chance to visit Bruges again.",positive
"Everything was perfect but if I really have to mention something, I would say the absence of a kettle, tea/infusion bags and cups with grip, as well as the fact that the fridge was empty. Indeed, when I arrived at the hotel I had to work straight away and then I attended an evening course online. Eventually, I did not have time to order any dinner from the list I received and, when I went out to look for restaurants, the majority was already closed and the ones I called did not deliver anymore at that time. So I did not have any dinner at all 😅. Fortunately, I had at least water with me. If in the fridge there had been some snacks, it would have been perfect. Furthermore, as to the absence of a kettle, it is true that a microwave is available in a common room, which was very close to mine. I also used it but I have to say that it was not always so practical. The first night I did not have any cups, so I used two glasses instead, but they burned, so I had to use some tissues to protect my hands😅. The second night I kept a cup from the breakfast but still it burned, as the cup did not have any grip😅. The third night I kept even the charcuterie tray from the breakfast and, like this, it was perfect 👌🏻, so easy to move the hot cup from the common room to my room. In any case, it was not a big inconvenience, I just had to adapt a bit. 
Furthermore, I think that kettles are present in other types of rooms (superior).,

I liked everything. The staff was so kind. They offered me a bigger room for the same price as the smaller. They gave me a list of open restaurants which offered delivery and take-away options - really useful, it would be much difficult to find a place to have lunch or dinner without this list. Moreover, the receptionists were able to face and solve a problem (by mistake, I had booked one night less than I needed) with kindness and professionalism and accommodated my requests and needs.
The position is wonderful, located in one of the main shopping streets of Blankenberge, only a few minutes by foot both from the railway station and from the seafront. Very close to the public library and to the Villa Belle Époque.
The breakfast was gargantuan! So rich, good and varied: both savory (charcuterie, salmon, different types of cheese, eggs, tomatoes) and sweet (viennoiserie, different types of jam, Nutella, lotus, yogurt), chocolate or coffee, butter, milk, fresh orange juice, different types of bread. In this period of pandemic, breakfast was served individually in each room.
My room, even though small, was cozy, confortable and clean. The only thing I would have appreciated might be a kettle with some tea bags and some snacks/drinks in the fridge. The toilet had a confortable shower stall.
The hotel is also equipped with a sauna, hammam and jacuzzi, which I tried one afternoon. You have to book it at the reception. I paid eur 40 and for two hours I had it all for me. Hammam was one of the best ever tried, with different and user-friendly functionalities, such as music which changed depending on the programme chosen (relax, purify), chromoterapy, but what I really adored was the scented rain❤️. Sauna was perfect. Jacuzzi was a coup de cœur as for the hammam. So relaxing! I appreciated that I was provided with everything I needed, such as different towels, a bathrobe and a blanket for the relaxing phase.",positive

All good,positive
"There was a lovely small pool - a bonus in the centre of Gent when it was so hot. Unfortunately people not staying in the hotel seemed to be wandering in and using it despite the notice on the open gate saying it was for hotel guests only. So it was really too crowded for us to use.,

We were pleasantly surprised by how quiet our room was as we stayed during the Gent Festival.With the windows closed and the air conditioning on, we slept well.",positive

We will gladly repeat.Large room, huge bathroom & shower.Very quiet neighbourhood, abundant street-parking available in front of the door to get the luggage in/out (although expensive to stay parked there - as in all of the inner city - parking on the belt is free and 5-10 min walk)Close enough to historical city-center to walk - far enough to use different ways, and to find non-tourist bars and restaurants in the area.Very warm welcome and great breakfast, daily prepared & warm buns/croissants.Fresh water/coffe/thee available, and trusting (affordable) self-service bar at disposal all day/night.",positive

"Hotel is 10 min journey by taxi cost €16 as our flight arrive in the afternoon and shuttle bus only starts again at 6pm.Rooms are a bit tired and could do with a re vamp.  Rooms noisy even with the ""extra"" door shut over. I was in 110 which is right above the front door so also has the added noise of people getting on the shuttle bus.,

Hotel staff made a note of our request to have rooms on same floor. Check in was easy. All staff are very nice and helpful. Breakfast was OK lots of choice but at €15 it should be.",positive
The valet parking and the fact that our car could stay in the parking lot on the check-out day is aan excellent service!,positive

"Was cold! Rooms Radiators wasn't working - we was told at reception that in whole Belarus radiators are turned off in may, no matter what the weather is like. And if you consider that fact, that room is quite big it gives you very cold space to live. The receptionist give us an electric heater so it was a little hotter, but still was cold. Next thing is very low quality breakfast. Really dont waste your money and take room without breakfast. Products served on breakfast are very low quality - and believe me - Belarusians meals are very tasteful and delictions! This things that they give us to eat was awful and old. Better go to nearest grocery and buy something to mornings breakfast (fridge is in the room).,

Really big room with equipment kitchen. Bathroom with bathtub a little bigger than usually. Balcony with cased by windows. Very kind receptionist. Close to metro (about 10 min.), close to glosery (about 5 min.). Clean staircase with lift. Was quiet. Beautiful, believe me or not, modern city.",positive

Right in the heart of the town so very easy to access the city centre. Staff were nice and allowed late check out at no extra cost. Baggage room available to use. Outside pool but full of kids so we didn't use it.",positive

The room was ready for us at 11am instead of 3pm which was very convenient. The room was great with high ceilings making the area feel a lot larger which was nice. The room has all the features you could ask for; two TV’s, a shower/bath, free grooming set etc. Loved this hotel.",positive

just to warn other travellers.. when you book the hotel pay attention to the name of airport you are arriving to/ departing from) there are 2 of them in Brussels... and really far from each other) so dont make the same mistake I did)) mixing the airports and than travelling for almost 3 hours to the hotel)),negative

"I don't have many bad things to say about the hotel but the only thing me and my husband didn't like was the smokers ""room"". And I say ""room"" because in fact it was outside without anything to cover it.. it was not protected from raining, cold.. nothing..
Also the guarantee that the hotel takes from your credit card is really awkward. I've booked many times in different countries from Europe via booking.com and I never had to pay a guarantee before arriving at the hotel... ,

We loved the fact that it was really clean, everything was out of perfection. Comfortable bed, beautiful badroom and very clean, nice lightning in the room.. and close to the station from Gent (Sint-Pieters).",positive

"Room was a little cold, and interior lighting was rather dim. By contrast, being on the first floor facing out, bright exterior spotlights shined into the windows all night. Blackout curtains are provided, though this also blacks out the morning light for those who like to wake up to it, it can be a bit irksome. Train also runs directly in front of the building, so occasionally a little noisy.,

Room was extremely spacious, spa-bath and bed were both extremely comfy after a long day of exploring Ghent. Breakfast was fantastic with plenty of offerings for the price. Staff was extremely friendly and provided plenty of information and notes on the city. Hotel itself is a fair walk from the city center, but only a few minutes from the train station and other public transport options.",positive
"The bathroom in our room had a curtain instead of a door. Not a big problem, given the size of the bathroom and room, but a door would be a bit better.,

Excellent room, with a great bed, nice chairs, a lovely desk at a window, comfy carpeting, a great bathroom. Everything extremely clean and well kept. Common living-room extra cozy. Great hosts altogether.",positive
"Everything was fine,

Very friendly staff and an excellent location very close to the train station, shops and the beach. Excellent breakfast.",positive
"Nothing to mention, just location is not in city center,

It's really clean and cozy, comfortable, new furniture, big living room, lots of space, nice bed, nice bathroom without general  issues with tap and shower you often experience in hotels or rented aps. it's quiet place, we weren't disturbed by street noise. You feel like at home there.",positive

Great location and large family room.",positive
"Noise of railway,

Breakfast was excellent!",positive
"My only recommendation would be to make the breakfast go on a bit later. Being up and out early is great but it’s also nice to have a bit more of a lazy morning when you’re away on your holidays. check out would also be better if it was a little later.,

Everything. The hotel was beautiful. Modern, quirky. In a great location close to everything. Breakfast was really lovely with such a nice personal touch. Katrien is very welcoming and Was so helpful with lots of recommendations.",positive
"""Screeching"" floor in the room.,

Breakfast- exceptionally good solution during COVID. A little bonus was a glass of sparking wine :-). Service was super kind and helpful. Bed was very comfortable. Spa facilities- very clean and relaxing space.",positive
Very friendly and professional staff. Room was super clean and comfortable. Hopefully next time will stay here longer.,positive
"Twice I was eating meat in the restaurant (spare ribs and chicken) and twice I had to ask for meat that wasn't overcooked /  fried so much that one could not use a knife. The service was great and swift with this, but I noticed an issue with cooking meat...Salmon was ok, but again, it looks like this process is not going well.In the room I expected a water cooker to make tea. The vending machine didn't accept two euro coins, and waiting for a fix took too long.,

The breakfast was very good",negative

Rooms very spacious, complimentary bathrobes and slippers lovely and nespresso machine a bonus",positive

This house is huge and very beautiful. On the next farm there are couple of friendly horses.",positive

Very practical and well furnished apartment, all in good state, hosts were nice, very close to the beach, quiet, shops nearby.",positive
"I couldn't find the wifi access code in the room and had to go back downstairs for it.,

Breakfast was a good standard - basics done well. It is the closest hotel to the port so I could walk to work.",positive

Very modern rooms, walking distance to the main sites and great value for money! I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The bed was very big and extremely comfortable!",positive
"What’s not to like!!!!,

This hotel was LOVELY. The location is excellent: right in the center of absolutely  everything. We had plenty of room for our 3-year-old and 5-month-old. This is one of our all-time favorite places we have ever stayed in Europe.",positive
Slept so well missed breakfast 🤣,positive
"Spacious , very clean , full equipped, I fully recommend it to everyone who want to explore Brugge !",positive

Perfect apartment, very well equipped, close to the centre, cosy.",positive

"Breakfast is quite a bit diversified.,

Well - prepared and very kind personnel.
The Internet worked very well.
Hot water and heat in the optimal parameters.",positive
"THe elevator was noisy: if you have a room close to it that can be annoying,

Breakfast had a good choise, in particular there was fresh orange juicy (to be made by yourself) and there was the possiblity to prepare your own  waffles. The hotel also has the shuttle service to/from the airport. It is really close to line 272 stop, to go i and out of the city centre.",positive
Quiet location despite the fact that it was at walking distance of the town centre,positive
"nothing,

Breakfast excellent, various breads and croissants fresh from the bakery, delicious home made jams, various kinds of eggs to choose from, freshly squeezed fruit juice, cheese and cold meats. And, of course freshly brewed coffee and tea!",positive
The bathrooms.. the surroundings..and the animals .. but you must supervise children under 5 years.. the stairs are not designed for young children,positive
La situation,positive
"not perfectly clean room, and corridors, hotel can use a bar since its far to any type of hospitality.,

Breakfast was very good, free parking, single room was big enough.",positive
"Beautiful house finished to a high standard and fresh, local produce served for breakfast. Katrien is very warm and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Fantastic location on the edge of the centre with a lovely 10 minute walk to the main square.",positive
"During the night there is a strange sound like it's like a drops of water through out the night, seems like that. Also the sink in the bathroom doesn't drain well :),

I love the staff they are really accomodating, friendly and warm welcoming. The breakfast is excellent ! The room is clean, expect I can hear some noise outside but it's totally fine. The location is perfect for shopping and groceries and perfect for summer !
Handsdown to their lounge , i find it so peaceful and romantic !!",positive

Location is excellent. Yards away from the Grand Place. Cheap and safe off street parking.
Friendly staff.",negative
"We did not realise that the BnB was as remote as it was from the local town.,

The owners were very friendly.",positive
"The living room and kitchen were not as they were shown in the pictures. There were dark wooden shutters/doors closed over the big windows on the left of living area and the narrow kitchen window. 
We booked the property because of the light - the images show light coming into those windows. But the owners REFUSED to open the shutters! 
This property is built to the side of the owners' house. They refused to open the shutters for 'privacy'. Don't rent out a house in your garden if you want privacy! (We live in a city and don't care about privacy; we wanted light.)
Also terrible were the kitchen, which had lots of cutlery and crockery but lacked basic cooking utensils or space to put away food, and the downstairs toilet and/or bar drains, which stank.,

At face value, it's a beautiful property. The decoration is stunning. The location is great for driving into Bruges while staying in the countryside.",negative
"Only the beds,

The cossines from appartment",negative
"The hotel is not close to the center and the road to the hotel is auwful. I think it is in an industrial area of the city so it is definately a very bad choice if you want to walk to the city center.  The hotel outside is very old and ugly so it`s a very poor quaility for the money spent. I will never book it again and don`t recomment it.,

Breakfast was nice and the hotel was clean. You can make free coffee, tea the whole day in the lobby bar. The tram/bus station is in front of the hotel which is very convenient.",negative
"Nothing. ,

A beautiful home in a quiet area just 15 minutes walk from the city centre. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Katrien was a fantastic host,  providing plenty of information on what to do whilst in Bruges, and her attention to detail was amazing. The breakfast was awesome too! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone.",positive
"We liked everything.,

Everything was as it should be. Staff friendly (both during the communication before arriving and on location), facilities are clean, breakfast has something for everyone.Although check-in is officially after 14.00, we were able to park and check-in at 10.30, which allowed us more free time to explore the town.They also have a nice small children's play area in the lounge, which is nice for families with small kids.",positive
"It is quite area, secured and the flat is big enough and comfortable. The staff at the reception were helpful and friendly especially Valantina if l spilled her name correctly. ,

I fore sure visit this hotel 🏨 apartments again",positive

Clean hotel, friendly staff",negative
"The drain from the sink was a bit stuffed...,

All went very well!!Ask for a room lakeside!!Fantastic view!!",positive

Owners are very reactive to requests.",positive
"A bit far from the old city.  You need to take a bus or bycicle,

Very good",positive
Everything was perfect!,positive
"Jut felt a bit cold in the room (in the evening) and in the bar (early morning). The double bed was a bit small considering we were 3 (a couple and a 1 1/2 y.o. baby).,

Very nice hotel, with very friendly and helpful staff (including the parrot). Great location! You wouldn't expect the hotel is that big from inside. Facilities like the bar, sauna, billiard room are quite a nice extra. The breakfast was quite a good surprise. You are asked the kind of eggs you want, and the breakfast variety was very good - there was even champagne!",positive
"Towels need to be renewed ...new sets are a must 
,

All was very clean...",positive
"The shower in the bathroom was open so water got everywhere so had a wet floor after we used each time.,

Beautiful view from your room of the lake and forest. Due to covid we had our meals in our room. Food was very good. Staff very helpful and friendly. Room was nice and clean.",positive
"Everything. The decoration is quirky in an old fashioned way, but it fits nicely with the environment! Big garden and terrace overlooking a peaceful landscape (the river, the bridge, there were even swans!) The room was comfortable, well equipped and spotless clean. They also have a restaurant serving an menu with excellent quality food and great wine selection (they select the wines that go with the food). The staff were all friendly and helpful, and it was a very good location to visit things in the area.",positive
Very helpful and nice people!,positive
Very nice people on a very peaceful place,positive
Bed and pillow too soft,positive
"Nothing at all.,

This experience is truly one of the box.  From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you feel relaxed and at home.  Katrien is at the heart of it all - a truly lovely person who really cares about her guests.  The breakfasts are just as beautiful as the reviews say.  We chose this accommodation based on the rave reviews and now we see why.  A real gem - thanks so much.",positive
"the only negaive point (but its pure my opinion and because I love good coffee) the coffee on the breakfeast is not from a machine with frech beans its the old way (perculator),

The men (Wim) who take care about the night reception and bar was very helpfull and friendlyAfter the intrance off the hotel is hiden a very beautifull place that gives you a very comfortable feelingQuality/price very good The breakfest is perfect and everything what you want is there",positive
"Not much around here, mainly for work stay. The cafe could put on a better breakfast as it's bland and same everyday.,

It's huge! Large space, open feeling with new everything. The cafe and staff in the same block of apartments is really good. Room is cleaned good everyday. Great for work with nice and comfortable furniture. Kid safe if you have a family. They have 2 different room types. The larger one has separate room. Everyroom has large windows to let natural light in. Reception works most hours allowing easy checkin.",positive
No regular tea available,positive
"The hotel is in a walking distance from the centre, the north railway station and metro. The room is spacy, cozy and clean. There are tea/coffee facilities, fridge to the advantage. Nice, friendly staff. A highly recommended hotel.",positive
Maria is super nice and always tries her best to help me:) the room is super clean and beautiful,positive
"Pillow was too small, could have two of such size. Rooms were echoing, thus some soft material in the room would help.Would be nice to install a tent or umbrellas on the terras for breakfast rather than bringing breakfast to the room on a rainy day under Covid restrictions. A drinking bowl for dog would be nice to be offered in the room for the additional 10 eur charge.Restaurant does not have a capacity on a rainy day, tent is too small, thus we ate in the village on 11/05. On 10/05 it was closed as well. These are just some things that could be improved to help the excellent staff.,

Super friendly staff on 10/05. That changed the impression about the hotel from an average modern building into a very welcoming and warm one. Balcony with chairs, table and view to the lake. Bed was confy, there was a fridge and safety box in the room. In general very pleasant service. We walked the route suggested by staff. Beautiful nature in the surroundings.",negative
"Nothing,

Cozy atmosphere, nice garden.",positive
"Very clean and well appointed apartments.  Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff",positive
"Only small details that would make it even better: e.g. have shower Gel in the bathroom; rather cool evening + night for my taste and heating not working yet; have a free power socket near the nightstand.,

Very nice B&B, très sympa. Bed nice and comfy. Good breakfast with homemade jams.",positive
"Getting to the hotel from the main road (it's in a cul-de-sac visible from the main road, but you have to drive around the houses to get to it).,

Good very clean hotel and excellent value for money. Prime location if you have business at the port or the businesses there - don't book it if you want the centre of town. There is free parking in front of the hotel too. I had a room at the back and it was quiet. It is not a flash hotel, but it doesn't need to be. Tram & bus stop outside the hotel.",positive
"Absolutely nothing
As mentioned by so many guests earlier, (even though we didn’t have an issue)the only disadvantage is that there are no lifts as it’s a typical Belgian style house , so people who have difficulty to climb stairs should think twice
,

I would write a novel on what we liked if you want!
Catherine is a lovely host who has it all.
Right from welcoming to planning our best spots in Brugges ( she taught us to pronounce it as BBrrrrugheee)
Spotlessly clean rooms and you have the lower floors with a dining and living space (not to forget the garden) done in a classical style.
Nice old music playing from Beatles to Bob
Map with a great explanation of what to and what not to do in the short time we had
Good suggestions for chocolate places, restaurants
This place knows what they are doing 
They are into real hospitality which has been lost along by so many hosts.
She was like a Mother hen taking care of our every single need to the extend that she even booked us a taxi to the train early in the morning 
This has made us thinking already of going back to Brugges again
Breakfast- homely, top quality and enough quantity.
24x7 free coffee machine/tea/chocolates 
Lovely beds
Large and ulterior clean toilets
and the list goes on and on and on
We recommend this and would rate it if we could give a double thumbs up",positive

"Value for money, friendly staff
Very convenient location, close to Gare de Nord 
Very good inhouse restaurant (Meat me)",positive
"Easy walking access through a park to the main attractions in Bruges. If you get there by car, there is a possibility to have a covered and secured parking spot for 10 euro/day. Breakfast is generous with a signature home made omelette and jam. Host is a long time traveler and has plenty of interesting stories to share.",positive
"I would prefer the view to the lake instead of street view. But we were already happy we had been able to find a room in this area.,

It was sparkling clean environment with everything we need for one night. Duplex room, where Kids could sleep above. Very comfy bathroom with walk-in shower you could only dream of.",positive

Nice location and awesome views from terraces and rooms with views (rooms with no views faced to the parking), polite personnel, comfortable bed and modern bathroom. Real good breakfast. All adapted to coronatimes",negative
"The front desk lady does not speak English which difficults the communication. ,

The hotel is located in a very beautiful spot next to the river. Its a calm place to relax but also close to other touristic areas. The breakfast is really good. And we had a great time.",positive
The bathroom was terrible. Growing mold in the walls. Unacceptable how they have the plumbing exposed and dirty. The tube was dirty.  I would not even let the bathroom door open becase I was afraid of the mildew spores. The hotel should  fix this inmediately,negative
"Everything is new , cleaned, comfortable beds.
Parking for free.
Excellent real coffee beans at the breakfast.
Fast check-inn.
Kindly personal.
Was a bit cold into my double room because the window was opened when I arrived and the heating doesn’t work (it is central heating for the building).
But at last i slept well. So it was not a problem to me. In the single room of my college was warm.",positive
"Absolutely nothing,

This is probably the nicest B&B we've stayed in.  Katrien was a phenomenal host, going way out of her way to make sure our stay was truly memorable.  The room was very well appointed, very comfortable and everything seemed like it was just built yesterday.  Breakfast was fantastic, with a different assortment all three mornings we were there.  The B&B is located about 1 minute from the inbound bus stop and less than 5 min from the outbound bus stop, making getting back and forth to the train station simple.",positive

Excellent location. Could not have better location! Accessible by Metro 1 from Gent Sint Pieter Station. Walking distance  to all attractions. Large comfortable double bed. Good sound insulation.",positive
"Arriving at this hotel via public transport was very easy.  The hotel is easy to find and during check-in, we thought the front desk was great.  The elevator system is a bit wonky but the room was large, quiet and comfortable.  We only had 1 night stay.  We did have breakfast and found it to have a lot of choices.  It was very international, as one would expect in Brussels.  Getting to the center of the city - Grand Place was a breeze.  It was less than 10 min walk, if I remember correct.  I would recommend this hotel easily.",positive
"Although the coronavirus is a big deal, we had to be carefull and take precautions, Brugge looked more like a ghost town, we had a great time and could celebrate my boyfriend s birthday. Thanks Maria. Regards, Martin and Marion",positive

the location was great, near shops and station. The hotel was nice and had rooms with alot of space. bed was comfortable and some small complimentary coffee was available inside the room. their staff is very friendly.",positive
"Unfortunately there were roadworks nearby at the time of visit which made access a pain (not the fault of the host,clearly),

Location and host",positive
The location of the hotel is really great next to a lake! The staff is very friendly. Unfortunately we ended up (after the cancelation due to the covid measures) in a standard room instead of the superior one with the lake view but it was definitely nice enough. Plus point dogs allowed 👍,positive

"everything was fine,

Great live music at the hotel bar on Friday evening, excellent selection of songs making young as well as the not so young guests dancing together. Loved the atmosphereI personally always love the breakfast - e.g. the fact that the eggs are freshly made in the kitchen for each individual guest.I also love the geographical location: in the main shopping street = as soon as the shops are closed in the evening, it is probably the calmest place in the whole town",positive
Bath robes and bath tub were great! Breakfast outstanding!,positive

Great welcome from the young man when we arrived.clean great location.Doing a Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'll be back",positive

Owner was very very friendly and breakfast was delicious.   The house was decorated beautifully and the garden was beautiful.",positive
"The wifi could be better. Also the breakfast was not so easy now with the corona measures , there was when you wanted to sleep out not so much choice left anymore. For the restaurant, limited choices for vegetarians.,

The Studio Rooms are great and we have one with a great view on the lake. With the corona measures, we really felt safe in the hotel. Also the rooms are quiet and lots of space. The terras was nice and had a great ambient. The view on the lake also provided a great morning sun.",positive

"A useful addition to all Booking.com listings would be detailed information on navigating to the property from the nearest Metro/bus stop.  It is almost always disorienting to arrive in an unfamiliar city and negotiate ""the last mile"" - in Europe, often along medieval streets not laid out in a grid!,

The Marivaux is conveniently located just one Metro stop from the central train station.  It is surrounded by the signature sights/neighborhoods of Brussels.  We had only an overnight stay, but enjoyed walking in the evening.  The reception provided an excellent orientation to restaurants/shopping, but best of all, pointed us accurately to the historic A la Mort Subite, where we had visited 15 years earlier.  The décor of the hotel is very much business/conference center style, but the rooms are very clean and functional, well lit, with a large bath/shower.",positive
The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was very tasty.the host was very friendly,positive

Location is perfect,",negative
"I arrived way after check-in time (which was 1500-1800). I called the hotel in the afternoon and they sent someone for me to check in just past midnight.

Absolutely a great place to stay!",positive

"Sign for the rooms...,

Very Courteous and helpful staff",positive
"Being extremely picky - the shower wasn’t a typical shower, you had to sit in the bath and sort of hose yourself off. Would have been nice to have a proper stand-up shower, but I guess it’s all part of the experience, so no complaints here!,

Everything! It was a wonderful experience and Maria was a lovely host. The breakfast was always on time and the house always absolutely spotless. Her english was also very good and she helped us massively by providing a map of Brugge and everything good to do in the area when we arrived! 10/10 would recommend",positive
"Unfortunately room in some places could be more clean. Under the bed and in some corners were spider webs...and really big ones like nobody looks there. We were with 2 children and i didnt like it,

She cooked us an exceptional omelet every morning along with fresh bread and homemade jam, salami, cheese, and the best coffee.  Her price was a very good price, the location was great, and she offered us a {costs extra} garage for our car which was a big plus.  We would stay there again for sure.",positive

But hygiene in the ecexutive room was repulsive, dog hairs on the carpet, even after mentioning to staff, when we went out for dinner and came back, were still there. Bedsheets with stains and 3 out of 4 (all of the kids on sofabed) were ripped. Decor damaged, dusty and outdated. Told kids not to touch anything. One of worst hotel stays ever. In the end managed not to pay for upgrade, but gentleman who checked us out should not have let us pay at all!,

The location",negative
"Rooms do not have much light in the evening and those towards the street could be noisier.,

Nic quiet rooms, reasonable price versus quality. Breakfast OK.",positive

It is the 2nd time that I have stayed in this Hotel, For me the staff is excellent, the breakfast is nice and continental, the rooms are clean and you have the facilities needed, the location was good, it is not in the center but it is the location that I need as I go often to an event in that area.I really like this place and I made it my official staying destination for when I visit Antwerpen.",positive
"We were with child. Our room (320) was nearby really loud music from the street. This noise was till 1 a.m. it was awful, and reception guy can’t help us and give us an advise to wait until 1 am. 😬😬🤦🏽‍♀️ unbelievable!",negative
"Not proper 4 stars hotel conditions, especially in the bathroom where the tiles were old and the toilet seat was rusty inside ,

Very nice location, close to the city centre - about 10 minutes walk
The breakfast was really good, a lot of options to choose from",positive
"It could really do with tea and coffee facilities in the room so u could make your own hot drinks ,

It was cosy and homely Maria made us all very welcome lovely lady with lots of good advice",positive

Location, views",negative

Very good breakfast, nice staff, beautiful place!",positive
"Rooms are very small and location is far out. No shops around the hotel. Not recommended for families.  No bar in the hotel.  Got the impression it is more a hotel for workers or sailors in standby.,

Standard and over aged Hotel, so all is basic but good for short stay only. 24hrs Free coffee is a good initiative. Views from my room (backroom) were a factory roof.   Free Parking in front of hotel is a plus point",negative

Location very good to the beach and shops, parking very convenient.",positive
"Great Suite, so much space.  Huge modern bathroom with walk in shower plus bath.",positive
"Some how I missed it was a shared bathroom when booking? The bathroom is shared with one other room. There is one room with a toilet. The other bathroom has a tub with shower hose (not fixed to the wall), a sink and mirror. We had no issues with sharing the bathroom with the other guests, it was not a problem at all. However, I still didn't notice it was shared when booking. We were in the ""Double Room"" which does not match the photos on Booking, The Double Room has a small seating area, and narrow stairs up to a loft where the bed is.  She did provide a small lamp on both levels. We left the downstairs lamp on at night so that we could see going up and down the stairs to get to the bathroom.,

Maria was an absolutely amazing host! We were originally supposed to arrive at 10pm, and she was more than willing to accommodate us. We showed up earlier than expected, at 5pm, and she was there waiting to let us in. This is a small B&B and Maria lives at the property. This is not a hotel with a 24/7 front desk and staff, so I was grateful Maria was there, although she wasn't expecting us until later. Upon arrival Maria was so welcoming. We sat at her table while she pulled out a map and made recommendations for places to visit, sight-see and eat. It was great to have some local knowledge, and although we had been to Brugge before she recommended places we had no previously been. After welcoming us she showed us around the B&B. It was very clean! We didn't see any bugs at all (let alone bed bugs as other reviews mention). Maria provided extra blankets in case we got cold. She had us inspect the bathrooms and bedroom to make sure it was to our liking. The WiFi was good and we were able to stream Netflix no problem. The parking is 10EUR a day, but its in her personal garage right next to the property. It fit my large SUV no problem, and the neighborhood and parking was very safe and secure. Every morning we were provided an excellent breakfast of fresh bread, homemade jam that Maria makes herself, cheese, salami and omelettes made to order. Tea and coffee are included. She offers fresh orange juice for 4EUR a glass, but neither my husband or I are juice drinkers so we declined with no problems or pressure. The location is amazing and about a 5 minute walk from De Halve Man Brewery. We found it very easy to get around by foot and didnt use the car all weekend.",positive

Location was good, close to center, free parking and wifi.",negative
"You could hear talking from the other rooms for part of the evening. Luckily it was quiet enough at night.,

Because of a discount we got an extra large room (and a free breakfast + two extra beds). The room was comfy enough with a view of the back garden (and the fire brigade close by). Bed, shower, television and room temperature were ok. The design of the room is modern and quite clean. Breakfast had enough choices.The location is good as it is close to the beach, the kusttram, some shops and restaurants.",positive
really good breakfast!,positive
"There's a light smell of cleaning products on the corridors,

very kind personnel. Clean room, comfortable bed, very well equipped bathroom, good WiFi and TV, enough storage. At one stone's throw from the airport. Due to Covid restrictions they served me a pretty good breakfast to have in the room. Very recommendable.",positive
"Both apartment buildings next to it are being renovated, very noisy during the day. Of course this is just temporary :),

Very sweet hosts, very clean and beautiful apartment (the entrance, tiny elevator and hall are all very old, but the appartement itself is nicely renovated). They cleaned the apartment afterwards themselves and took out the trash, so you really feel like in a hotel room. Great location with the coast only 50 meters away.",positive
"Building needs some exterior works,

Close to city center. Clean rooms.",positive
"Maria was amazing! great value for money, great location- really close to centre of Bruge. Was surprised to find the parking space was a garage which made me feel that my car was safe. Will definitely stay again. Thank you Maria",positive
"Atmosphere in the restaurant was non-existent. Maybe more diners would improve that feeling. But nothing else could be described as “did not like”,

Breakfast that was included in the price, was really good. Dinner in the restaurant was good, but we thought a little overpriced. The ultra-modern, minimalistic room on the ground floor was superb, even if the view was not.",positive

Maree was a very welcoming hostess, the property was spotlessly clean and the breakfast was 1st class.",positive
"We were given a basket of bread that obviously been from a previous table, one slice of bread was broken on and one of the butters was already opened. Also, for some bizarre reason, the TV switched itself on at around midnight and again towards 2am! Not a nice feeling, had to unplug it to be sure it won't happen again...,

Beds were very comfortable, evening meal was nice, we chose from the board, a la carte rather pricey, good breakfast with several choices, excellent coffee. The hotel is located above a beautiful lake were you can go for a walk or run, kids play area there too...",positive
"Not really a negative comment but the small rooms are as advertised so if you like a lot of space choice the larger room. It'll be worth the extra cost.,

Warm friendly staff. The garden overlooking the river is very pleasant with table and chairs and even hammocks to enjoy your afternoon drink. The hotel has a full bar and we felt the prices were very good. Room air conditioner was more than enough on several very warm days. Breakfast is served on beautifully set tables in the restaurant over looking the garden and river. Florenville with many restaurants and shopping is just a short drive away.  We did not eat in the hotel's restaurant but plan to next visit. This is a gem of a hotel!",positive

Maria is a great hostess.",positive
"The breakfast was 'continental' basic - adequate.The restaurant was pricey for its evening meal offer without being of exceptional quality.The reception was unmanned for long periods with slow response to the 'buzzer' alert.,

The Hotel is located in an old quarry area under re-development for leisure activity.The hotel building is relatively new and in contemporary in style.The area has become more popular as a holiday location for Belgium & Dutch visitors.The hotel is easy to find in Neufchateau , a straight forward drive from the motorway exit",positive

"Whole hotel was little bit dirty. Better to use cheaper hotel ibis few meters next to this one. It is cheaper solution and quality je almost the same. This hotel just hlave aircondition. By it is not worth almost double price as that cheaper one.,

I am not able to find any advantage of this hotel.",negative
Great breakfast-many choices,positive
The hospitality of the host Was just astonishing. Did not expect such a warm approach. She gave all the instructions and recommendations were to go that was very helpfull. The check out flexibility was convenient as well. Highly recommended,positive
"It would be nice to have access to a kettle so that guests can make themselves a hot drink before bed and perhaps some complimentary water as offered by most hotels.,

On our first visit in August we were given an upgrade to a wonderfully large room set on split levels which was perfect for an adult with teenager. On our second visit we booked a double/twin room which was also very comfortable with a lovely view of the lake. It would be nice to have access to a kettle so that guests can make themselves a hot drink before bed but apart from this our stay was marvellous.",positive

Very clean, open, easy and comfortable room!",positive
"The room was next to a common area and during the evening you could hear the people on the next room until a bit late in the evening.,

The bed was super comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was quiet good and vast, we were not able to finish it all. You can easily walk to the city centre of Brugge, around 2km. The owner was attentive since the beginning.",positive
Bether then ibis budged,positive
"Breakfast could be better and can have more options.Room could be cleaner (dust was noticed). Also adding a drawer or more space in wardrobe for my clothes would be nice.,

Room was comfortable, but with no much facilities inside compared to the price.Breakfast is fine but not wow.Room is soundproof with no noise at all. This was great.",positive

Nicely positioned B&B with a very accommodating host.  It was a flying visit so we did not have enough time to truly appreciate the Brugge experience.",positive

1. No wellness facilities located in this room.  
2. Next to the kitchen/common area which is very noisy untill late in the evening and does not give you a great feeling of privacy

4. Overpriced.

"Reception guy didn't tell us where the room was. It was room 16 so we walked upstairs to the first floor but those rooms were 20+ so we had to walk back down past the reception desk along a corridor. The guy on reception kept his head down.... Very strange.,

Excellent location with terrace overlooking the lake. We booked a double room and a triple for a party of 5 (3 adults/2 children); both rooms were a good size with excellent shower. Open shelves so we did not risk leaving anything behind in cupboards. Restaurant was good with a decent children's menu.",positive
"Excellent location to be in the city and quickly on the beach. Top staff and management team, extremely flexible and helpful with a friendly personal touch. Great breakfast and very stylish rooms.

Maria is a quirky and charming host and we enjoyed getting to know her even if our stay was very brief. She also went out of her way to help us on our last day which we greatly appreciate!",positive
"No problems except the hotel seems to have confused it’s name with possibly the company that owns it and maybe it’s restaurant name so that it is slightly confusing on arrival to be sure you have the correct address as the sign outside is not overly helpful!,

Staff very friendly and efficient. Hotel easy to find and good value. Evening meal and breakfast tasty though not a very wide menu choice.",positive
Our stay in Belle de Nuit was perfect in all its aspects. The room was very unique and chic and the breakfast was amazing. The couple owning this lovely and stylish boutique hotel went all their way to make our stay perfect. They accomodated to all of our requests and were very warm and flexible. We also had a wonderful dinner at the hotel restaurant belle de jour which was by far the best I have had in Belgium for a long time. I would definitely recommend this lovely boutique hotel to everyone staying in Oostende.,positive

Very central location and had an underground car park.",positive
"We stayed here during summer and as the hotel is located in the bar-area of Oostend there was a lot of noise until very early morning. It didn’t make the stay less unpleasant but if you’re not up for that ask for a room on a higher floor.,

Great room, great taste, mix of vintage and art, best breakfast ever!",positive
"The sink was kinda blocked. I requested at the reception but no one cared that kinda ruined the experience a little bit because if you're paying €107 per night... Everything has to be perfect.,

Room was really nice and comfortable. The road is quiet and food is available nearby. There was an espresso in the room super cool.",negative
"Hallways smelled of cigarettes even though there were signs saying no smoking in hallways.

Price , front desk night guy was nice",negative
"Fabulous location, close to the seaside, centre of town, great artsy design interior, just above the restaurant which has a great design, delicious menu, nice atmosphere.

"What a disappointment! This hotel is not fit for purpose, dirty, loud and unhelpful staff. Also a lovey view of the car park to top things off and people smoking right outside our window all through the night! Not ideal when you have a baby in the room with you. ,

I honestly can’t find anything good to say about this place. We stayed in 7 different hotels on this trip and this was the only one I wished I hadn’t book.",negative

The location with view over the river is just perfect. You can just sit by the window and watch the birds and boats and relax. The studio is equipped in a very efficient, comfortable and cozy manner. The host lady has thought of everything (salt, tea, coffee, hairdryer, useful information on day trips, emergency numbers etc). The studio is adjacent to the owners' beautiful house and they are available to address any question you might have during your stay. The small town is very charming and has a grocery store, bakery, pub, pizzeria, and some restaurants. You can make beautiful walks from here. Highly recommend place for a romantic relaxing getaway.",positive

Nice atmosphere and great facilities like a coffee machine. It was also easy to get to.",positive
"Elevator could use some fine tuning in it's starts and stops!  A very eccentric elevator.,

Didn't eat the breakfast offered",positive
"We were shoved in a room that smelled of smoke - I was traveling with my young children and we arrived at night.  Even though we booked a twin room, we got two tiny beds next to each other in a really tiny room... upon complaining the check in guy came and moved the beds 6 inches apart to make it a ""twin room"".  Just ridiculous.  The room had no amenities, not even drinking water.  I was told that this is the ""standard Ibis affair"" and he claimed to have seen 13 other Ibis locations - I might have my doubts since I have stayed at various Ibis hotels as well.Stay away - far better and cheaper options available near the airport than this junk!",negative
"No great problems but a little over priced and a lot of low level noise during the night because of thin walls. Room could have been cleaner, most things were clean but cobwebs and dust visible.  Probably wouldn’t stop here again. ,

Reasonable for a 1 night stopover with pleasant and helpful staff.",negative
"Well, the buses were on strike when I stayed there, but I’m certain that there was nothing my hosts could have done about it. In fact, they told me about it in the days leading up to my stay, so that I could take measures, and they advised me how to handle it.,

Lovely place to stay. Patricia and Michel are lovely people and really made me feel at home. Also great communication leading up to my stay.",positive

Apartment is accessible by a separate entrance via garage. The studio sits on the 1st floor access via spiral stairs. Stairs can be a bit difficult for people who has mobility issues.
Owners of the apartment  speak good English and they were the best host so far we ever had. They were very friendly and helpful. Provided us bus card, bikes to go to Dinant and told the best way to Brussels etc . Car gps was taking us via hilly path via Rue de Nannes which we find bit tricky. Owners told us to go to directly to Namur then which leads us to motorway E411 very smoothly. In short we really like the property and would like to go back to in future",positive

Bungalow (mobil-home) in excellent condition, super clean, comfortable, lots of storage space, well-equipped. Fantastically placed IN the forest, just next to a little stream (not all the bungalows in the camping are like that, we were lucky!). Beautiful place.",positive
This hotel was clean and friendly. Our room was spacious and the bathroom had a lovely walk in shower. The evening meal and Breakfast were very good. It was close to the lake for walking. There was lots of parking spaces.,positive
The tunnel leading to the location was closed causing a walk of over 1 hour,positive
Alles was piekfijn in orde. Perfect.,positive
"All good,

Home made honey and jam , yum. Very personal service. Beds very comfy",positive
Friendly staff and good localization.,positive
"No ventilation in the room and very bad ventilation in the bathroom, that is why it was quite wet and too hot. The spare balconies do not give a lot of comfort. The beds are too soft, and you hear all the noise in the corridor.,

In mid-season the price is very nice. The sealine is in 3-4 minutes walk. Some shops and local restaurants are nearby where you can see a lot of locals, not just tourists like in city centre. The reception is very friendly, the check-in and check-out were fast and without problems.",positive
Start booking with breakfast include when get there is not included this second time happened with booking .com,negative
The ambiance was very warm and friendly service.,positive
"Although pets were accepted, it seemed that they were not welcome. Pets were not allowed into the restaurant or breakfast room and had it been wet or cold sitting outside would not have been an option. Also, we had a room at the front which abutted the car park. As the hotel is not air-conditioned it meant that we had to have the window open Because of the room's location, if people were smoking in the car park the smoke wafted into the room. Although the restaurant was open there were no menus in Reception and you couldn't have a meal unless you booked in Reception,

The location of the hotel was excellent overlooking the new Park and lake and if you had a room on that side it would have been good",negative
Very nice people !,positive
Enjoying my morning coffee from the windowsill with a lovely view!,positive
"Not much of a view due to tramstation in front.During breakfast someone (owner maybe?) popped in twice and not even goodmorning. But not sure who he was, just guessing.,

Good place close to restaurants. Good breakfast (great choice) Overal good experience.Arrived a bit late so I arranger to pick up the keys by someone else with no problem. 👍",positive
This my second time in Brussels and my second time to stay in the same hotel because of its great location and big rooms,positive
good location,positive
"Somewhat worn out and room did not seem completely clean. And was quite small.,

Very good breakfast though, enough parking and close to bus connection downtown.",negative
"We were there off season which was noticeable in the facilities. The toilets and showers weren’t really clean or being cleaned, the snackbar was closed and there were some noisy other guests that seemed to have a more permanent residence there.,

Location was gorgeous, owners were really friendly, flexible and helpful. The river to canoe is beautiful, kid friendly and relaxing.",negative
"The dinner in the restaurant was very disappointing. Only one of the vegetarian options was available. The advertised price for dinner for those staying in the restaurant had gone up and was a single fixed menu which did not appeal to us, so we ate a la carte. We were twice presented with an incorrect bill - incorrect as to what we had and as to price. We eventually managed to get it right but this caused confusion for our final bill when checking out. The price I had been quoted for our upgraded room was exceeded in the final bill and the receptionist refused to change it.There is no bar in the hotel except during the limited hours that the restaurant is open. You can buy cold drinks at reception, but coming back on a very wet afternoon there was no possibility of obtaining a hot drink which I think there should have been. Do as we did and take a travel kettle and supplies.Cleanliness: In the breakfast area of the dining room there was a pedal bin which had not been emptied for at least two days and which had fruit flies multiplying inside it.Safety: the wooden flooring of the balcony was extremely slippery when wet as it had not been cleared of algae.This could, and should be a lovely hotel, but these things spoiled it.,

Location beside the lake was wonderful. We upgraded to a room with balcony which I would advise.",negative

"We stayed for 3 night but each day our key did not work and had to be returned to reception to be recoded. This was inconvenient because we were on the 6th floor and one night I was unwell and needed to use the bathroom but couldn’t get back into the room. It was very distressing because the staff were not concerned and told my husband the machine was broken and they couldn’t fix it. Luckily I found a bathroom in the foyer,

The apartment is large, tastefully decorated and had all possible things one would need for a comfortable stay.",positive
"Breakfast is very small (I uploaded photo).It is written 10 minutes from the train station. In fact, it is minimum 20 minutes by car, when there is no traffic. When it is traffic - 30 minutes. The closest market is 10 minutes from hotel (by bus).It is written on the site, there is a hair drier in the room. It is not true. You must ask on reception to get a hair drier.Take into account if you need iron, on reception, can tell you that somebody other took it and he still has not returned it back.They do not accept credit cards, in both reception and restaurant. They do not accept foreign currency.So many things different that information they published on the site made me feel not comfortable there.,

It is clean",negative

Clean, and modern with everything you need for a cycling holiday. Good secure bike storage, a fully kitted out kitchen and nice comfy beds!",positive
"This is my second visit and I certainly look forward to returning many times more. What was lovely, remains lovely; but it does not remain entirely still in time - Bart and Mo are discreetly busy with improvements, exciting and promising glimpses of the future.

I could come late. The bed was comfortable. The breakfast was delicious, eaten in a very good company of hosts.",positive

We feel very lucky to have stayed at the Kirisavan. The hosts are very friendly and go out of their way to make their guests feel welcome and help them plan their trip. The breakfast is delicious and beautifully presented. You will be given a bag to prepare a picnic with the leftovers. They make sure you have everything you need.

Spacious, luxurious and fully equipped Apartment next to Victory Square.
Great location, Metro, shops and restaurants just outside the door.
Great value for money.",positive
"If you have a car it is fine. If you don't have a car you have to take a very long (almost one hour) mini van in to the city centre and it's not the most convenient thing ever. Also there is no ATM near by and you need cash to pay so heads up and bring cash with you!,

The staff were really nice and helpful. The rooms were nice too. The on-site restaurant is good if not slightly expensive for Minsk but they were super accommodating. We don't speak Russian and everyone made a huge effort to communicate with and help us which was very much appreciated!",negative
"Very little - location is in a quiet area with limited eating options, a couple of bars and (good) bakeries - there is a 30 min walk into Oudenaarde (or drive) but this is an easy and very pretty walk along the river.,

Plenty of space, could sleep 6 easily. Very clean. Practical and comfortable layout - large kitchen/ dining/ lounge area, with all the amenities you could want (including utility room). Nice touch with a bottle of local beer waiting for us. Parking was fine, just round corner on main street. Owners very friendly and helpful.",positive

Netflix on TV, atmosphere of the spot is so heartopening, I was and I am still so impressed. The breakfast in the morning was just a spectacle. Fresh orange juice, italian coffee, sunny side up egg and fresh bread served directly on the table. They even gave me a bottle of local beer and marmelade upon departure. I am looking forward to see you guys again. All the best for you:-)",positive

PLUS...* Finding a hair on bed sheets is not acceptable (hygiene wise)!* Threatening complaining guests to call police is not a good ""customer service"" practice! and when it comes from the manager of the place, there is a serious issue over there!* We booked a 4 persons room with 1 large bed (my wife & myself) and 2 small beds for my 2 kids, we had to sleep all of us on the large bed for what mentioned earlier up! and i ended up waking up in the middle of the night multiple times instead of having a good sleep.,

good and quick need more english tea",positive
"We do not feel this hotel is worth 3 stars: no coffee making facilities in the room - not everything is as clean as it should be - when we came down to breakfast there were no more bacon and eggs - the fruit offered was overripe. On top of that, we paid more for this room (although I am a Genius member) than was indicated in the room.... A disappointing experience - not to be repeated.,

My partner and I really enjoyed staying here. We only stayed 1 night and we did some cycling in the area. Our bikes could be stored in the garage so they were very safe. The room is nice and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast is great - you can order your preferred breakfast options upfront. And the Thai dinner we had during the evening was one of the best Thai dinners we ever had. Highly recommended !!",positive

I like the front desk staff. They were very to helpful. Also always smiling even if they were busy",positive
"When the parking is already full with restaurant guests, there aren’t many options to park off-site, we got lucky but I can imagine it could be an issue ,

Beautifully furnished room with great attention to detail, very friendly hosts and amazing breakfast! Very close to nature & hiking area. Definitely worth it, we would stay here again for sure",positive

The location",negative
"The staff weren’t helpful.  We have stayed in 3 hotels since in different areas in Belarus and all of the rest have registered us and made our stay easy. The lady at  reception gave no help, just a website to visit. It’s also in the middle of nowhere. ,

Cheap.",negative
"Bart and Mo are exceptional hosts. They attend to every detail and provide you with the most comfortable and tranquil stay. They took such good care of me and my 2 year old toddler. What delicious breakfast to start your day! What comfortable facilities! For visitors from Flanders, your holiday is indeed Borgloon, Limburg, Haspengouw ... but when you enter Kirisavan, you could be on holiday somewhere else abroad. England? Some exotic part of Asia? Some fascinating and not easily pin-pointed pleasant fusion. At any rate, two holidays in one....",positive

The style, the bed and the size of the room. It has a coffee machine with capsules and there is also a fridge with two bottles of water.",positive
"Breakfast is really bad, not only it's a small portion single meal but also prepared with cheap and not healthy ingredients. Restaurant located in the basement, it feels dark & filthy in there. I was charged circa 10% extra to the booking.com rate as explained by hotel it's due to currency difference. Room prices are set in USD, whilst normally you expected to pay in local currency. This reminds me of the era right after  Soviet Union collapsed. When everything in CIS countries was traded and sold in USD. Not much has changed in Belarus since that time, it's still stuck in post Soviet times.Soap is limited  to 2 portions per person. I would be keen to learn, how are you suppose to shower and wash you hands throughout the day with that amount?Window's  sound insulation on the top floor is terrible, can hear motorway all night long.,

Nothing really I liked about the hotel. Maybe just the proximity to the motorway. But at the same time this motorway kept we awake during the night. Parking is free but limited and very muddy, why not too throw more loose chippings or better to cover with concrete surface.",negative

The apartment was in great shape, beautifully furnished and decorated, very clean and welcoming. We enjoyed all the facilities and were happy to have a parking spot without booking it. The jacuzzi was great, though in the winter the water cools down very quickly (1h-1h30). The staff very kind and responsive, the checkin/out simple and straightforward.",positive
"Really, we were pleased with every aspect of our stay at the Cremehuys bed and breakfast and certainly plan on visiting again the next time we are in the area.,

The room has been outfitted with so much attention to detail and is located in a beautiful setting next to the Cremehuys cafe. The booking includes a fabulous, amazing, over-the-top breakfast and the owners are so attentive and friendly without being at all intrusive. Couldn't ask for more.",positive

"Right next to the beach a 2 min walk ,

Very good access for us from the airport",positive
I watched the hotel for reservation starting from 1:00 am in the morning. I had to pay extra for it. But they asked us to put the booking in the previous day (because their computer is not updated the date!!!!!) and had to leave before 12:00 pm next day (flight was in the evening).

The staff is very welcoming and helpful. The reception is designed as a tea table where the manager welcomes guests. The atmosphere is very friendly. The room itself was very big with a balcony with a nice view and a super cozy and soft bed. Room was clean and had everything: from towel to ! coffee machine, yes your own. Exceptional quality for this price. Thank you very much, Peter! The hotel is conveniently located near the beach. The area is calm and seems to be safe. There are many restaurants on the seashore. I would really recommend this place.",positive

Great location, clean room and nice service. Guys in reception were really helpful. I was pleasantly surprised that there was gym in this hotel. Also one of the reasons for me to choose this hotel was Nuxe cosmetic:)",positive
"No washing up liquid or kitchen cloths for wiping down the surfaces. Getting around the beds was awkward and I fell over the corner of the bed and badly bruised my shin.,

Accessibility for Malmedy and only 10 minutes from Spa-Francorchamps circuit. Plenty of towels and toilet rolls for the bathroom. Comfortable sofa and beds, although the beds were a little low. Easy to use heating, which was invaluable when we returned cold and wet in the evenings.",positive

"The fact that it dies not come with a kettle to make a warm drink. Surely this is a standard requirement for any hotel/guesthouse? I do realise I did not read the small print in depth as ""room only comes with bottles of water (these were v small). The room came with a large fridge though but I had no use for it as you were told you cannot eat in the room. My main concern was one night I came down to the ground floor for a cup and on returning to my room my electronic key card would not allow me back in my room. There was no staff to help me in reception. My mobile phone was in my room! Hotel guests also could not help. There was a notice on reception table to ring a number. I used the phone in reception (I had no other) I kept getting answer service. It was now 23.00 at night, now I was very tired thinking I will have to spend all night on sofa in reception. I am an older traveler. If I had poor health problem, ? Needed urgent medical treatment (? Where is the defibrillator position) or a grandchild locked in my room what could I do. Eventually a member of the staff, a young lady from somewhere in the hotel came down. She was angry with me for using the reception phone and kept saying I should use my mobile which was in my locked room. She said to me they never had this problem before!!! She was blaming me causing it. Eventually she changed my room card and I could enter my room. Nearly midnight and exhausted. This is not acceptable for a hotel guest to be treated like this. In the morning I told the day staff what had happened and the girl said it should not be like that. I was offered nothing for my inconvenience. 
I must also add the duvets the hotel uses have all separated inside so that is why the hotel must keep them in a roll! I had an old stain spot on my sheet. Also there was only a mattress cover on the mattress topper. Would I use or recommend this hotel again? Probably not. ,

It's situation was very close to where my relative lives.",negative
"A little tired, not badly,

Location",positive
"Easy check in, lovely large and clean apartment",positive
"At first the room didn't look that nice, maybe because it is a bit too crowded. At the end, it was good - it was just a bad first impression. Overall an ok hostel.,

I do this evaluation considering the amount paid by the room, which was very low. The address was very easy to find, but when I arrived in the morning nobody answered the door... I gave it some time and finally I managed to get in. The receptionist spoke very little English, but understood nicely Spanish, so we manage to understand each other. The bed was brand new and very comfortable, with your own lamp and power plug.",positive

"Super thin walls, you can hear every word if people in the next room are talking in normal voices. No common place to sit and relax. There is only a tiny kitchen with bar stools or you can sit on your bed, there's no other option. From what I've understood there are rarely any travellers among people who stay there - but just people of different age who come to work. This gives the hostel a different vibe from what I'm used to.,

It was clean enough. The beds are pretty comfy. Not too far away from the subway station (about 10 minutes by foot). A supermarket in the next building (8am-11pm). The stuff was friendly and helpful.",positive

I think that they did not like our visuals : )) We asked for ironing service, they immediately sent someone with everything, but it was hard to connect the desk for ironing. In the room: it was not as clean as is supposed. There was a card, there was written - if you put it on the bed we will change - clean the bed. so i put it on the bed and expected new pillow cases and etc. but when i came back late at hotel they just corrected the bed and did not change.... Also, the lights of the room was really not enough for reading.,

Well, the hotel was very nice. The location is great, if you know in which direction to go and not to go.The room was big and comfortable, with good and comfortable beds and pillows.  Good breakfast that i liked... The bathroom was comfortable. plus a corner shower in one room and a toilet in a different room.

"The property is perfect. The only issue we had was that we travelled during a highly unusual heat wave and as with most Belgian properties, our room was more adapted to cooler weather than hotter weather. Not a criticism - as I said, the property was fantastic - but a fan would have been handy. ,

The rooms are extremely well decorated and the breakfast in beautiful dining room was nothing short of exceptional. The location was perfect for those with a car, perfectly situated between Bruges and the Belgian coast. However the best aspect of this property was the wonderful hospitality. We were made to feel extremely welcome and comfortable. We'd highly recommend this property to visitors travelling through Belgium.",positive
"The toilet and bathroom could have been more cleaner. There was a certain kind of stench in both lavatory and bathroom.,

Everything else was great..",positive
"It was close to the beaches in a quiet area, and therefore the majority of activities (bicycle rentals, stores, restaurants...) required a bit more walking to get there.,

Rooms were very nice and we had our own little semi-private deck adjacent to the main bedroom.  This is a very quiet area surrounded by farmland with a nice pathway that takes you towards the town and eventually the beaches (10-15min walk).  The grounds have a nice common area with both indoor and outdoor activities for the family.",positive

It was a nice place to live.,positive
"n/a,

Excellent breakfast!",positive
"The heat in our room was just unbearable. We measured up to 45°C, even with an open window all night long it was really bad. Bring your own fan if you consider booking one of these.Notice that tourist tax is not included.,

Also no air conditioning so opened bedroom windows but appartment is sited at a busy road junction and it was very, very loud overnight. Finally, there are 3 apartments in the building but ours was up 2 flights of stairs. No warning of this and a real struggle with back/leg problems.,

Really nicely decorated, clean and well-furnished appartment; love the nespresso machine! Ideal for a short stay. Excellent fan provided in the living area to counter the heat, thank you!",positive

"We waited for 3 hours just to eventuelly call booking.com and get the door code. Before that time, none of our messages and calls came through to the owner- as was instructed on the door. This was frustrating, as we were simply left outside in the cold. We also werent told what room was ours (luckily, booking.com knew). The next day, the owner barely apologized, responded with 'I was busy' or something of the sorts.
The shower flooded easily.,

Otherwise the appartment was nice, clean and cosy. If the owner steps up the game as far as convenience and service goes, this could well be one of the best price/quality youll find in this town.",positive
Everything was fabulous. Christine was an excellent host and the breakfast was excellent. Highly recommend this place.,positive
"The tea they serve at breakfast (Earl Grey) was tastelesss,

The room, the location, the friendly staff, the bar",positive
"This is a huge hotel, which meant that the elevators and breakfast room were always quite busy and crammed. The building is also a bit old and didn't look like it had been renovated recently-there was also a weird, musty smell around the corridors, at least on the third floor. There are predominantly dark colors, such as deep purple, on the walls and carpets (since there are pictures of actors everywhere, perhaps to resemble a movie theater as a theme?), which makes the inside look a bit gloomy at times. We asked a member of the staff how much a taxi ride to the airport would cost and were told 20-25 euros depending on traffic, whereas the next day, another member of the staff told us it would cost 40-45 euros (it eventually cost 49 euros). Even though these are not major problems, we might choose a more southern point in the city for any future visits, as the area around Marivaux seemed a bit less lively and somewhat rundown (however this is clearly a matter of personal preference).,

We were pleasantly surprised to find how spacious the room was! We also really liked the bed mattresses, which were exactly as firm as they need to be after walking around all day. The room had most probably been renovated and was quite clean. It also came with many amenities such as an espresso machine and espresso capsules, slippers, notepad and pencil, safe, refrigerator, and hangers, all of which were really useful. We particularly appreciated the small, complimentary bottles of water. The desk and closets were also rather big and convenient and there was more than enough room for our luggage. The bathroom was also spacious, with a separate bathtub plus a corner shower in one room and a toilet in a different room. The staff were always very polite and friendly, we couldn't open the refrigerator upon arrival and they fixed it the next morning. Last but not least, the hotel is right next to a subway stop (Rogier) and roughly 12 minutes away from Grand Place on foot.",positive
"Everything else was perfect ,

A bit noisy traffic",positive
"We spent five wonderful days at Christine's charming b&b. For our main goal - to visit Bruges - this was the perfect starting point. The breakfast was superb - every morning Christine suprised us with little extras or fresh fruits. Our spacious room was most tastefully decorated - the perfect place to come home to after long walks through medieval Bruges. Our dog was warmly welcomend too and enjoyed the surrounding countryside as a nice contrast to the crowded city. In the morning Christine gave us superb insider tips for must-do's and nice places in Bruges and the ""Ommeland"". She also told us where to park our car when we went to Bruges. Since there are several parking areas with low or no fees at all, staying outside of the town isn't really a disadvantage.From the first moment on we felt that everything Christine does she does with love. We highly recommend this charming place and will certainly return to her fabulous hide-away!",positive
I put in my booking that it was my birthday and that I was spending it alone. The room was decorated with balloons and I was very pleased with this gesture ! Thank you,positive
"The lights of the room. İt was not enough.,

The hotel was in the city center. Close to many restaurantd and Shopping area.",positive

Very smart with covid’ procedure, all information were very clear , staff very helpful.",positive
"Location is very good. Close to Brussels Noord station more, but all the tourist attractions are in walking distance! Room is quite big with nice amenities.",positive
Christine is an amazing host who greeted us very nicely at her b&b and offered us a great experience and unique stay. The breakfast was very carefully prepared with local products and homemade pastries and fruit yoghurts.,positive
"Spa was.closed covid... not tye fault of the place. ,

Very nice rooms , comfortable and big. Great value.",positive
"Great location near metro and the city center. Big room, with nice view throughout the window. Good breakfast, friendly staff.",positive
"It served our purpose of just eat and sleep for one night well. Yet, the premise can be disappointing if you want more than that; our room was in an annex behind the owner's house, separated by a tiny non-inspiring courtyard and our view was on the closed screens of the owners house. Nothing romantic/historic/industrial design here. Direct surrounding is just Flemish village style homes. We didn't explore the neighboorhood. Booking promised 35 m2 room, actual room was around 16 m2, no minibar.,

We stayed for 1 night. We were hiking in the Hoge Kempen and this place (at 20 car minutes) was the only reasonably priced hotel we could find. Basically not much wrong, room was clean, staff was friendly, small restaurant at the location with good food and decent price (but check opening times, I believe only Thursday-Sunday). More B&B than hotel.",positive
"The only change I would make is that the sheets on the bed needed ( for me ) to be of a higher quality - but that's minor,

The breakfast and the hospitality were magnificent, and the location brilliant if one wanted peace and tranquility, and lovely views. The information on the local are and communication beforehand from our hostess Cristina was amazing.",positive
"The Steigenberger is a truly wonderful hotel. The entire hotel smells amazing, is spotlessly clean, and the staff is friendly as ever. The rooms are very spacious and the beds more than comfortable. The bathroom in the room is designed beautifully. We will be back.",positive

"The lights were a bit dim, but it wasn't too much of a problem. A couple of outlets didn't work, and this was a bit of a problem as me and my girlfriend had a lot of electronic devices.,

The furniture was very nice, it really suited my style. I loved the bathroom sink made out of black marble. The room was clean and comfortable. There were a lot of depliants in the hall, very useful to navigate the city and find out about monuments and exhibitions. The hotel is in a very nice position, near the Rogier metro station, the City 2 mall and the Grand Place. The staff were very kind. We didn't use the facilities such as the gym and the Meat Me brasserie, as we wanted to enjoy the city and spend the least time possible in the hotel. Overall, really good hotel for the price, I would recommend it.",positive
"The owner, Regis, is an interesting guy. He takes care of a great breakfast every morning and tends to be relaxed, outspoken, easy going and takes great care of traveller's needs. The B&B is a cosy place in our favourite part of Brussels with plenty of shops, cafes and restos in the vicinty, along with easy access to the city centre.  You need to be aware of the fact that you are sharing the place, as Regis also uses the dining area as his Office.",positive
"We opted for a place outside Bruges to stay away from the crowds and our choice couldn't have been better. The b&b is located just outside town and ideal to explore also the beautiful countryside, specially if you have a bike or rent one. But it was our host, Christina, and her warm hospitality together with the exceptional breakfast she served us that made our stay really memorable. (She also provided us with all we needed to know to move around the area)",positive

Besides that we found a dirty washer (with some kind of moss growing on it) and we had an episode of clogged drain in the shower.

"Sound of highway.,

Free parking.",positive
"The only issue I have with the hotel is that in the rooms, the coffee cups they provide are too small and they all only provide plastic stirrers for the coffee. In a world where we are trying to stop the use of single use plastics, this is not at all in tune with the times,

always a great place to stay. The rooms are wonderful and although the hotel gym is not good at all, one can pay to use the spa downstairs. I would suggest giving guests a discounted rate or not charging though",positive
The hotel was very accommodating in giving us an early check-in upon arrival which was much appreciated,positive
"Booking.com should make it clearer (before the booking process) that check-in is until 22:30,

Great concept and idea, nice setting, child and adult friendly, great staff (all at least bilingual) !!! Beautiful swimming pool",negative
"Communication with the host was slow eg we weren’t sure whether they had received our message about breakfast as they didn’t confirm. And breakfast was really disappointing - 15 euros for very basic products, and not at all the bio products mentioned in the property description. Just ‘value’ yoghurts, cheap croissant etc. Don’t have the breakfast! Also incredibly dusty under the bed, and some maintenance needed in the bathroom. Also very small eg loo is just a door of the bedroom, so not great for privacy - fine if you’re expecting that but it was a bit of a surprise that it was so basic for the price we had paid.,

Great comfy bed, great location, nice and peaceful.",negative

"We had an experimental tent because it was the only one left, and I think the price was very high because it was last minute but I feel like it was too high for the available facilities and service.
The showers were not clean or handy and the service was quite slow and bad.,

The decor and place was amazing, such a beautiful location, very original concept and great for kids.
The food was also very good, the breakfast was very complete, so many activities around and all family friendly",positive

Location is perfect, very clean big comfortable room, private parking, tasty homemade breakfast, pleasant English-speaking host)",positive
"Noise because of the location near the highway, limited card of restauration because of transition works in the kitchen,

Very attentive staff, beautiful rooms and reception and bar/ restauration.",positive
The noice from the motorway. I think the window noice insulation is not the best. Or maybe it was the fresh air inlet above the window that I couldn't close?,positive
"Amazing buffet breakfast. Biggest selection of meats, cheeses, bread and cakes we've ever seen, anywhere.",positive
"The water tap would run with warm water for just a few seconds and then turn to cold again. The shower on the other side, was just fine. 
,

The Shaka tents are great! Specious, everything available. The beds were comfortable.",positive
"I couldn’t find any TP in the toilet/room. Not that I needed to use the toilet...,

The room was nice, tidy and clean. The host was quite easy going and arranged access for me to my room, despite his absence. (I got there late because of work, so the host already left). I booked this place because my weekly business trip hotel was fully booked. My first B&B experience, but I would do this again. It’s a cozy place with a homey feeling I’d bring my girlfriend to, should I visit Antwerp in our free time.",positive
"Set in the countryside away from main road.,

Delicious breakfast, host went above & beyond.",positive
"Restaurant is overpriced ,

Good gym, breakfast",positive
"It’s a bit tricky to find, make sure that you use the recommended address detail. Don’t think about popping out for a meal or a drink as there’s nothing around it.,

Top hotel where everything was of a very high quality, but that is matched by the prices. Room was plain and functional and spotlessly clean. The owners are friendly and very professional.",positive
"Check-out max 10:30 AM not ideal.,

Excellent locations. Breakfast beyond expectations.",positive

Clean tents and toilets Nice location.",negative
"Breakfast. Lots of fussy little packaged portions of so many different things. Why not just croissants and jam? Confusing cleansers in shower: three colours? why not label shampoo, gel and so on? Likewise at basin which was soap and which lotion????,

Furnishings, especially bedside chairs were beautiful and so comfortable, and bedding. Bathroom and white towels.",positive
they offered us comfort room although we paid for standard room,positive
"The rooms are outdated in total need of a revamp, not very clean, I think they change the towels in the room and nothing else, I walked across the room from the shower and had to change my socks again. They are in dire need for proper cleaners!,

The staff were great, food very good",negative
"There is some construction work in the neighbourhood (road works) which make navigating around a bit harder (as the parking spots are a small drive / walk away). Probably this will be resolved in the coming months as work is finished.,

Very friendly staff at breakfast assisting us with the highchair; apart from that, the selection of food is very broad. Furthermore, the hotel has all facilities required for a convenient stay with a little one (microwave, highchair and baby cot).",positive
"I wish the restaurant would’ve been open so that we could order food to our room. I know COVID has caused a lot of things to close but this would have been nice.,

"Location.Cutest breakfast ever. And high quality, too.Super cool people.",positive
Very nice hotel with an amazing buffet for breakfast.,positive
"Nothing to add here,

The location was excellent for us because we appreciate quietness and nature, so we enjoyed riding the rented bikes from downtown Courtrai to the hotel, about a 15 to 20 minutes leisurely ride. The owners of the hotel were pleasant and attentive. The room was spacious, nicely decorated, and the bed was comfortable. We were very satisfied.",positive

The room and the facilities were fine",positive
"This bnb is so good I came back for a second time! Totally worth the 1.5 hour drive. The place is clean, exactly as depicted in the pictures and has value for money.

The room interior and cleanliness, as well as the friendliness of the staff.",positive
"All was very goodStaffBreakfastLocation",positive
"The parking lot is way too far. Takes ages before the shuttle bus arrives. We even walked back from adventure valley cos the bus wasn’t coming. The tent could have been cleaner. Even though it’s camping for that price we expected spotless clean def in times of corona. Dust & spider webs. Bathroom was ok though. Little outdoor kitchen would be a nice extra. After all too expensive for what you get but the glamping experience was nice.

Great experience. Good location.",negative
Best breakfast going!,positive
"Everything was good.,

Anja is very friendly!",positive
Isaak is very worried with the comfort of his guests,positive
"The airconditioning was sometimes a little bit loud. The beds were technically not one large queen-sized bed, but two separate beds put together and layered with a top mattrass. Nonetheless, we didn’t quite experience this as less comfortable, but still…,

The hotel’s location is perfect and everything is both modern and classical at the same time. This provides a comfortable and enjoyable stay.",positive
"Window was located towards the street therefore it was a bit noisy ,

Great location next to central station, cool design and friendly staff",positive
"The elevators were half broken and we couldn’t get a good signal on any of the tv channels. When we went to aspire for a spa time they didn’t tell us they had water gymnastics on, which really ruined an hour of our stay at the spa. They should have informed us about It beforehand.,

The staff was very professional and they make everything to make you comfortable I truly recommand this hotel",positive
"There was nothing about the hotel I disliked,however it is so quiet in the immediate area,like a morgue I would say..certainly no night time entertainment so if you are working of visiting in the area then it's perfect but don't expect anything else. I can see why the hotel is busy because there is nowhere else to go apart from a couple of restaurant/bars which I was told were very good and a small local bar which was very quiet.Also make sure you research taxi services if that is what you require because I couldn't get one from Neerpelt station as I was told there are very few taxis as they aren't required! All in all I found it a very strange place but quite endearing,as I said I can't fault the hotel in any way so if you are requiring a good quality hotel at reasonable prices I would highly recommend it but don't expect anything else from the area,I was working and as my long searched for taxi driver said there is nothing here to see !,

Excellent hotel could not fault anything.paid €315 for 3 nights excellent value for money.I ate in the restaurant on the first night and it was lovely food with a nice cosy atmosphere,it has obviously got a good reputation for food as it was busy with non hotel guests all eating.The breakfast was very good with a wide selection of options from bacon,eggs,different breads and plenty of pastries..I stayed 2 weeks before Christmas and the decorations were lovely in the hotel.I cannot fault anything about the hotel so if you are visiting the area I would hesitate to recommend this hotel.",positive
"Our main shower was broken this ment we had to use the small one which was awkward, we reported it but nothing was done. Also in the room we had 2 coffees and 4 tea but on 2 milk. ,

The location is brilliant and the hotel is clean and tidy. The room was a good size. The bed was very comfy if it wasn't for the dodgy shower the hotel would of been perdect 5 star",positive

"Comfortable room, big space.",positive
"BreakfastWelcome",positive
"As it is still a camp bring along everything you might deem needed. As only a small fridge is available no freeze and nothing else, Nothing.Missing a swimming pool.,

We had no private bathroom but due to the fact that the camp was not that full. It was pretty going late to the bathroom for a shower. The bathrooms itself were also individual private although public so this was also good. The room and beds were good and place looked quite good overall.",positive
Space and cleanliness. Good amenities.,positive
"A wonderfully warm welcome on our second visit. Our host went above and beyond our expectations, particularly when my son injured himself. We were also enormously grateful for the lifts to and from a local restaurant and to the train station. Thank you so much. We love your place and look forward to visting again.",positive

I am a frequent visitor of this Hotel and I have never been disappointed. Ideal location, very clean and supported by helpful and very efficient staff. I have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel.",positive
"Nothing really. My only niggle was the fact that because it was summer and I had my windows open I could hear a fountain in the Courtyard all night from my room.,

The accommodation is a group of lovely old buildings approximately 6km outside Geraardsbergen. The whole place is beautiful with guests being able to use the large lounge and kitchen areas. There’s plenty of outdoor space with a large landscaped garden. It was perfect as a base for cycling. I was met by the owner who showed me around including a secure place to store my bike. The room was modern and well equipped. The owner was very helpful and even let me use the room to shower in after I had checked out, which was fantastic. I wish I could have stayed longer and will definitely go back again.",positive
"Nada,

Location location location",positive
"Everything was perfect ...! Never been so satisfied in an urban hotel like this one. What you actually see in the pictures ,it is what your really  get when you arrive .Thank you everyone for your excellent service.I do really like that they hired young stuff , I loved the funny message on my check-in card “open sesame “ ,its eco friendly- wooden base ,vintage and industrial decoration in whole building , the pressure of the water in the shower , the 7th floor view from my room , the mattress of the bed and the right size of pillow for my neck . They have even added a bolt in the door to make you feel even safer when you are  staying in your room.Every detail matters and I think they have really taken care of this in every inch of the hotel. You see that they really implement a project which focuses on customers needs. They also provide super soft slippers ,big TV screen ,espresso machine in your favour and in the morning , wow ... you will get a fully complete balanced and healthy breakfast .. So,don’t hesitate to include it in your booking...",positive

"Slightly warmer shower!,

Bed was comfy, room amazing and lovely terrace",positive
"Parking but that is it.,

Nice place to stay and very close to Kleine Brogel Air Base.",positive
"Possibly the noisiest air conditioning I've ever come across - in the bathroom you could feel the thudding of the air pressure changes as the duct fan rotated and my phone measured the sound in the main room at 80 dB. It was at least consistent, so it faded into the background in a few minutes and didn't stop me sleeping.,

Large room, clean, decent bathroom. Friendly helpful staff.",positive
"There were construction activities during our stay, we did not know about. It made quit some noise. Even though the (Shaka) tent looks very nice, a couple of things were broken, like the toilet handle, bathroom light, piece of (outside) chair was missing, value for money was not to be found there. Also, we received the keys for a second row tent, while there were tents available on the first row, prices were the same, but still were given a tent with a much lesser view.  The second night of our stay, there was a party going on and even though they were asked (at midnight) to turn down the music and be considerate of others, this was ignored and sleeping was impossible until after 1.30AM.,

The scenery is amazing - public facilities looked neat, clean and new.",negative
"Slight smell of sewage or something else close to the reception area.,

Excellent place to stay at.",positive
Very cozy bed&breakfast! Everything was fine. Thank you!,positive

I was so happy with the bath. It made my stay worth it.",negative
Top bediening! Kamers waren perfect en een zalig bed!,positive
"Excellent location, classic hotel, very convenient",positive
"Staff was really nice and the breakfast offer was huge! I understand that due to the Corona regulations, breakfast buffets are no more allowed. But, instead of offering an individual buffet on a guest's table, I would offer ""breakfast à la carte"". The staff put so much food on our table, that we couldn't finish it...the sweet pastries were not even touched. Normally, the leftovers will have to be thrown away, as they were already served. To avoid waste of food, I would opt for a ""breakfast à la carte"". So, people only order what they are able to eat and they can order more food if necessary.",positive
"A lovely hotel that is a 15 minute walk from the central station. We arrived in late and we were only there for the 1 night. Check in and out was quick and pleasant. The room was large, with a super king size bed and a shower with a separate bath. The hotel is quite modern and within walking distance to the shops. We were disappointed we had only  booked one night here.",positive

Fantastic breakfast!,positive
"The breakfast was a little messy and limited for me. We only had some breads and no fruit to choose. We were given a bag with all the necessary item, but we didn’t have spoons and knives. It was okey in general, but could have been a better experience with the breakfast. The staff was super friendly. ,

They were thinking we are going to have lunch and dinner at the hotel because of the COVID so the put a table and two chairs in the room. Well done, but it could have been better if they put some tableware and forks. Great staff and rooms were cozy.",positive
"Pillows were slightly lumpy.,

Amazing stay, couldn't have had a better view. The fireplace, the open bathroom, the complementary champagne bottle, the beds, everything was more we were expecting. Great breakfast service, we even could take something extra with us for the day. The local pizza place in Durbuy delivers to the camping, but make sure to order well in advance.",positive
The place is charateristic an genuine  I would come back here without any doubt.,positive
"The toilet is only behind a curtain not a door, a little awkward when two in the room. ,

It's an amazing place with a very high standard in a pretty location. I think it's actually really underpriced for what it offers! The hostess is super nice and the breakfast could not have been better.",positive
"Cold water in the bathroom at the arrival but rapidly fixed by the staff,

Location right in the center and not so far from train station Close to shops, museums and restaurants In this sanitary context, Take away and deliveries were made easy",positive

Good location, friendly staff. And feel as at home. Thanks for the great experience.",positive
"Cathedral was under huge constructions (May 2021) but it is not disadvantage of the guesthouse,

the rooms (I would also say the “houses”) are pretty, lovely, cosy, well designed. The accommodation is very very authentic and original. It is well located in the center, but it is also quiet.

Room,comfort,location",positive
It was so near to the beach. The apartment was comfortable and Martiné was soo adorable and kind. I only can recommend it!,positive
"It's not cheap and the furniture is pretty basic. In a unique location like this, you'd expect a bit more, maybe some historical information about Antwerp or at least St James, not just the standard info on where to eat or drink.,

Superb location in historical Antwerp, everything within walking distance. Charming houses built against the magnificent St Jacobs (St James) church. You're basically sleeping next to Rubens.",positive
"I'd just mention the room's view, but since we were out for the whole day, it didn't matter.,

Perfect location, close to the City centre. Standard room was quiet and comfortable. The view could have been better (facing a wall), but apart from that, everything was nice. Breakfast was sufficient and good.",positive

Great location and the staff was amazing.",positive
"- Chosing your own ingredients for breakfast is not possible: the cook prepares an English or a continental breakfast.- I got ONE (!!) toast with my English breakfast; when I asked more, I was told there was no bread in the kitchen anymore.- On our second day we were the only residents in the hotel and therefore the management told us we would not get a breakfast. We disagreed because we rented a room WITH breakfast. The cook did come, but she was not pleased.,

The location of the hotel in the center of the city is superb. Nice and clean hotel.",positive
"The convertible sofa could be a little bit more comfortable and for a longer stay you might be missing an oven.,

The lady (Martine) was super nice, she showed us everything, the apartment is small but cosy and you will find everything you need. We very much appreciated that we didnt have to bring our own bedsheets and towels and Martine thinks about small details like soap, detergents, basic cooking necessaties, tea and coffee, cotton pads, games and pencils for children etc. The apartment has a great location, just across the road to the beach and a few metres from the dunes where you can walk your dog. We will be back!",positive
The stair up to the bedroom is pretty steep.,positive
"Nothing, you pay for what you get. 
A perfect trip from A to Z. ,

It was my third time in Bruges, but I never get tired of this city. The hotel is next to the Rozenhoedkaai, the most photographed place in Bruges. 
It is located right in the middle of the center and 2 min walk distance from everything !! (The Belfry, The beer wall, Choco-Story, Markt, De Halve Maan brewery...) 
The room is charming and cosy, architecture is typical Belgian, you’ll be next to the canals, and the gooses. 
The staff is helpful and friendly. 
My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay !!!",positive
1 min walk from train station.  right next to shops and restaurants and entrance to China Town.,positive
"The coffee that was delivered to the room when we ordered room service wasn't great, and was pretty expensive (€6)*but since there was a nespresso machine and complimentary pods in the room, that didn't matter too much.,

Spacious, spotlessly clean room with an amazingly comfortable bed. All staff we met were lovely, especially room service and bar staff (ask Pierre to make you a cocktail!). Room cleaning seemed a little bit inconsistent, but I think that's because different people service the room at different times of the day i.e replace towels and make the bed at one point, replace items at another. Could be wrong on that! And it really didn't matter in the grand scheme of things. We had a fantastic time overall, and are already planning on staying there again.",positive
"Nespresso machine in the room, bath, large room, good comfort, fast free wifi, close to cinema.",positive
"Great location, lovely apartment containing everything that we needed. Lovely and clean and bright. We would recommend without hesitation and would return. Hosts were friendly and helpful, and collection and drop off of keys was easy.",positive
"-,

Nice, comfortable and clean rooms, perfect and quiet location, friendly and helpfull staff.
Really recommandable!",positive
"Nothing in the wrong way. I have no comment about it. 👍👍👍,

Everything is alright!! Martine, our host , is super ok !! We loved it at Franky's. Franky's apartment rocks!!🤘🤘🤘🤘 Very intimate for 2 or a family with 1-2 kids.We let you discover it yourselves .😉",positive
"- The only thing was that via email it was a bit difficult to get a quick response back. - Be careful if you have someone old or unable to move because the stairs are very narrow, but that is only because it's a historic place. (so not really a con they can control),

- Proximity to the downtown (specifically the Meir)- The fact that you're basically staying in church- The private entrance- The flexibility of the cleaning staff- The ease of getting a hold of someone on the phone when you call",positive
"Amenities in the bathroom were disappointing. There was literally no holder for the shower head, and no shower curtain or divider. This made it pretty difficult to have a decent shower - constantly had to hold the shower head and have water splashing everywhere. For a hotel of this standard I expected more, people don't want to run a bath in the height of summer or when they just want to get fresh before dinner. Also the size and quality of the provided shampoo and shower gel was very poor, and the towels were quite thin.,

Location is absolutely perfect - a few seconds from the markt and other beauty spots. Room size was great, bed was comfortable, wifi was great. Staff very polite. Value for money good, as the price was very reasonable. Very quiet hotel with no disruption from noise.",negative
"Set back from the main road, quiet, great beds.",positive

"It was a shame there wasn’t a toilet in the 3rd floor bathroom for the 2 double bedrooms up there.,

The house was nice and central and everything was within walking distance. There was plenty of room for the 4 of us.  The house was fully equipped and to a high spec. The outside area was an added bonus",positive
"We imagined it would be a boutique hotel, but there was apparently just a B'n'B suite - the affable owner greeted us then went away for the weekend, so we had our section of the property to ourselves. Only downside was a particularly cramped washroom. Oh, and the dreaded Belgian cobbled country lanes!,

Charming rustic location, woodland walks, spacious garden, comfortable inside the house. Excellent restaurants nearby in Lasne and Ohain - eg Les Trois Canards.",positive
"I am familiar with this Hotel and am always pleased to re-visit when I can. Staff are always welcoming, efficient and very helpful. Am always pleased to recommend this hotel to family and friends.",positive
Good modern small hotel in the historic district.,positive
The lady was very kind,positive
"Everything was good. ,

The duplex layout gave plenty of useful space with everything you need. The bathroom was spacious with a good shower. The bed was very comfortable.",positive
"see above,

The location is probably the best in Bruges. Our room was EUR 150 and we had a beautiful view. Breakfast was painful however. Despite Corona rules everyone arrived at breakfast at the same time and one member of staff was ‘policing’ all the food. She was borderline rude and disorganised but you could tell that she thought that she was doing a great job. The food itself was very uninspired, but that is typical of Bruges. From a culinary point of view, Bruges is pathetic. still serving the same crap as in the 70s, 80s, 90s.... The town however is so delightful that most of the time one doesn’t really care. And the beer is always good of course.",negative
"Nothing, I wasn't disappointed with anything throughout my stay.,

Very clean and comfortable, nicely decorated with a calm atmosphere. This hotel is located in the hub of the transport system so you can go anywhere in Antwerp and beyond from here.",positive

"Thanksfully we had the chance to get the bedroom with a bath cause when we saw the shower, I realized that it would have been a nightmare for me to have a shower there. Thanksfully the bathroom was really nice with a nice view. Maybe some curtains would have been nice.The mattress was a bit hard (maybe we are used to soft ones) and the service quarters were a bit dirty (spiders and dust) but the bedroom was perfect.The shared bike weren't prepared even if we asked for them during the booking.They have maybe some bad points (nothing can be perfect) but I really want to recommend this place.,

We have been really nicely welcomed, they had some key issues that they solved themselves quickly and without any annoyance for us. The dog at the entrance was so nice that my girlfriend is already missing her even if she is usualy afraid about dogs.The bedroom was perfectly cleaned. The view from the bedroom and from the bath are wonderfull. The house is located close to a golf and a riding arena. The localisation of the house is just perfect.I think that this house should be really nice for a familly (4 to 5 person) during summer. Relax, swimming pool and nature (only 2 bicycles, no mountain bikes sadly) Really good wifi and both bedroom have tv screen with the usual channels.The bathroom is really nice.We haven't had breakfast because of personnal choices so no way to inform about it.I recommend this place.",positive
"Perhaps a few more English translations.,

Enjoyed it all particularly dining on the terrace.",positive
"We had an attic room, the ceiling was not comfortable enough, but we know about it while booking. ,

Everything was almost perfect: staff, location, clean room, free water and tea. Nice breakfast. Private parking.",positive
"Small for 5 people but for one night ok,

Walking distance to beach",positive
Amazing experience overall.,positive
Got a free upgrade to a river room - really fantastic,positive
"The breakfast can definitely be better,It is overpriced and very basic.,

Good place with a great atmosphere.The staff were very niceThe room is well designed, bed and shower are comfortable.Good location next to the train station but still quiet",positive
"I was double charged, and when I told the receptionist, she told me this is the policy of Belgium, they block the amount when checking in and charge you the whole bill when checking out without considering the hold amount, so they charge double because its Belgium policy as she mentioned ,

The location and the room",positive
"The beds are very light. When you put two people together its very easy to fall in the middle since the beds separate really easily.,

Great facilities and location, staff was nice too.",positive
"Nothing.,

This hotel is situated in the countryside, a calm and relaxing location which suited us very well. Restaurant was closed due to an event in the hotel so cannot comment on the evening meal.  Due to Covid-19 restrictions the breakfast was delivered on a tray and was more than adequate to meet our needs.  Hand sanitising and mask wearing protocols were in place along with social distancing.  There was a high standard of cleanliness throughout.  We will definitely revisit.",positive

Karen the owner was there everyday and if you needed anything she would get it there and then the place was spotless  it had everything you wanted or needed very friendly and helpful yes this is a place you should stay",positive

The room is modern and clean. The bathroom is great!",positive
"Nothing except the fact that it is a bit far from the center but we can take the tram to go there really easely,

The Good point for this appartment teadiness of it and the comfort you have. You feel at home easely with all equipments there are.  Martine was a really friendly host and adpted the hour of arrival and departure for us. Also she has been really helpfull in all the ways (showing the flat around, helping us to find a parking spot...).PS : The flat doesn't have a parking spot. But you can find free parking around the flat, Martine help you with that.",positive
"The stairs are very steep and narrow footing so didn't feel I could carry my suitcase upstairs.  Having said that there is nothing that the owners can do to rectify this, but its mindful that if you have a heavy or large suitcase, leave it downstairs.,

A great standard, crockery, bathroom fixtures & fittings, comfortable very big bed!  Lovely quiet courtyard outside, which would be perfect for a morning breakfast or evening drink.  Collection of key very simple and handy too.",positive
"Nice location, helpful staff and nice view from the room",positive
"I ate in the bar downstairs which was nice. Food was good but format of service wasn't very clear. Wasn't sure if I wait to be seated, order at the bar, pay at the till etc. Staff were really nice and it was very chill but maybe a bit too laid back! Would've been good to have had food as room service, but again, not too clear if they do it.,

I love this hotel. This is the second time I have stayed in the last few months and it was exactly the same experience this time around. Great design, location and value for money.",positive

"There are two rooms with each a kingsize bed in it, we were appointed the one next to the bathroom which seemed very nice up until we tried to sleep in it. The sheets felt like they were coated with plastic, the matress was very hard but managed to form a deep hole after 10 minutes and the pillows fell flat immediately. We wondered why they gave us the uncomfortable bed, whereas the other bed felt very comfortable with nice sheets and good pillows, but after closing the windows for a while we found out it was because of the horrible sewer smell.The bedroom was connected to the staircase of the owners with a wooden door and was above some kind of bar/livingroom where the owners were entertaing some guest till 1am and were running up and down the stairs which made it even harder to sleep.The room didn't seem very clean. We found an open can in the fridge and clothes in the drawers.The television didn't work. Curtains in the bathroom would have been nice.,

The location was very nice. With better weather the swimming pool would have been very nice. Hiking paths pass right next to the house. It's pretty spacious although not very functional.",negative
"I was in transit to a business meeting in the Netherlands. It was extremely conveniently placed, a few metres from the Autoroute, with no traffic noise, in the room. The restaurant was excellent.So good that I stayed in another Van Der Valk hotel, the following evening.",positive
"Hotel is located in a quiet street. Rooms are comfy, spacious and clean. Very nice staff, good safe private parking. Included breakfast was tasty and was served in 3 sets to choose. So highly recommend to stay.",positive
"I didn't have a problem with them, but the stairs are very steep! So for anyone that has mobility issues it would be very difficult and not recommended.,

I had a great stay at Bernardin. A gorgeous property in a quiet location, yet close to the Historic centre. The owners were more than helpful and breakfast was delicious! I would definitely recommend.",positive
"Oldish room - outdated ,

Great location and view",negative
"The fact that I had to go onto the hotel's website to prebook the breakfasts  to get them five euros cheaper than  the price advertised on booking.com,

Well designed, comfortable, quiet rooms.. I loved the bench sofa sitting area in our room.Convenient location near the central station. Good breakfast with plenty of choice.",positive
"Even though it is one of the reason why we went there, it is very far from everything else but at the same time you can truly enjoy the nature of ne it’s pure beauty ! Sunset are so beautiful here ! ,

Amazing hotel in the countryside, surrounded by a golf. Very nicely renovated. Immaculate. Huge rooms. Do not hesitate to go there !",positive
"The building work started early but won't go on long I suspect. Bit noisy when cars went past but the central location more than made up for this. Lovely to stay somewhere on a par with our family home.,

Host available when we needed her. Great location, although a little noisy (building work started before 7am which seemed a bit much). Lovely comfy beds and plenty of pillows and towels, even toiletries if needed. Well equipped kitchen and plenty of space. Central location.",positive

First class accommodation  -  without fault. Owners welcoming and helpful. Small details like milk, water and beer! in the fridge",positive
"Slightly further outside of Brugge than some would like, but easy enough to get a taxi into the centre.,

Well presented hotel with large comfortable rooms and modem decor. The front of house areas have recently benefited from some alterations providing a more lounge/ bar area and an updated outside terrace . Excellent choice of food at breakfast, friendly and helpful staff, very clean with free parking.",positive

Staff were all pleasant and helpful. The room was spacious and quiet. My request for a quiet room away from disturbing noises was fulfilled. Plenty of room in the car park and the location was handy for the motorway and also the town",positive

The staff was very friendly. Safe parking place on the backside. Room was so cozy. Location perfect. Price ok.",negative
"The stair going up to bedroom is a bit narrow and would be easy to fall down from it even if we didn't. Yet, we had to walk very carefully.,

Very kind staff, we called the owner and told them we would arrive after midnight and she was being very helpful to let us to pick up the key. Great location, the famous shopping street is less than 10 mins walking distance and it is right next to a church, super cool.Unique building, it is a very old building with a nice design.",positive

Nicely located. Loved the mix of the old church wall, the old floor with the modern shower and furniture. Staff was professional and friendly. Will come again, really enjoyed my stay!",positive

Beautiful hotel, superb surroundings, friendly staff, enormous room. The hotel is a mix of modern convenience and old-style character. And they let me park my motorcycle in the basement garage. I will definitely be back.",positive
"Not a lot.,

We were met at the door by Alain who was most genial and spoke good English. We were shown around the ground floor apartment which we had booked. Everything was clean and some supplies had been placed in the fridge for us. There is a large open plan kitchen and living room with a toilet off the kitchen and a twin bedroom with en-suite shower and a view over the private courtyard off the living room. Off the entrance hall is a steep set of stairs leading to a small landing with a twin bedroom to one side with roof top views and a shower and toilet on the other side.The courtyard is partially decked and gravelled and has a large table and chairs. Plants and climbers are growing around the perimeter of the courtyard and it was a relaxing place to sit with the sun reaching into the area.The street outside is narrow (requires parking on the pavement to unload the car) and safe, free on-street car parking is a short walk away. The apartment is ideally situated with 2 shops selling delicious cakes and bread within a 2 minute walk and a supermarket within a 3 minute walk. A number of restaurants and cafes are all within a 5 minute stroll.Ieper is a beautiful place to visit. It feels safe to meander around at night, there are historical attractions and wonderful architecture around every corner and the Apartment Aurora is ideally situated to be based at and even has secure internal parking for bikes. A highly recommended place to stay.",positive
"all was good,

only stayed overnight, driving to Denmark, really nice hotel for a short overnight stay, driving by.",positive

Very modern and clean facilities. Very quiet. Very large room.",positive
"Nothing the apartment was perfect,

The apartment was excellent
The owners were welcoming and friendly and had even put milk and water in the fridge for us. The apartment had been finished to a high standard with en suite shower facilities etc in both bedrooms.There is satellite tv plus full kitchen facilities there was even a washing machine and dishwasher. The location is excellent, it was about a 2-4 minute walk from the cloth house.
The owners had even provided a filter coffee machine with coffee and filters. You honestly couldn’t ask for more and I will certainly book there if I go back.
I would highly recommend the aurora apartments to anybody looking to visit Ypres.",positive

There wasnt anything to dislike! Karin was at the property on arrival, she was so helpful & friendly, as there was 13 there were no problems whatsover, the accommodation was just lovely, clean & inviting, the location was perfect just a few minutes walk to the Grote Markt, we were in Ypres to enjoy the weekend of cycling, beer & fun, the accommodation was just the icing on the cake!

"No coffee with the breakfast ,

All , but there is delay for opening the parking gate",positive
"A pair of hooks for the towels, please.,

If you travel a lot, and welcome something different, the Bernardin may well end up in your favourites. It has its quirks (courtesy of the steep stairs and ultra-hip – read ""pared-down"" – design, but the style is impeccable, the rooms in the courtyard ideally peaceful for after a busy day (with very appealing outside seating when the weather permits), and excellent hospitality by Stephanie and Bernard. The location is great for central Antwerp, but far from the commotion of the Meir.",positive
"Would have preferred a room at the back of the hotel
As street noise might disturb you if your a light sleeper ... the odd car etc ..
But it’s not too bad on the whole. And probably not worth worrying about ... ,

Perfect location ... Very clean and comfortable rooms,
Great friendly staff... only just tucked away from the main square , And a very short walk to loads of great restaurants and kerbside bars/Pubs ... pretty little Venice possibly!!",positive

Very well equipped. You can cook, listen to the radio, watch tv, read. Children were so happy to find toys and colouring books in the room. Very pleasant host.",positive

"The name of the property is not well indicated; the house is hard to find the first time.,

Staff are very good.Location is good.",positive
"Not that it mattered much but in a duplex arrangement, perhaps you could put wet points on both floors. Had to run to the bathroom upstairs each time we wanted to fill the cup of water.,

First of all the lady at the checkin is a charm. Made us feel welcomed and refreshed. Secondly, the location of the property is very apt. Right next to it is the Sint-Jacobs tram station, as well as the Meir shopping district. Lastly, the property is very nicely maintained. It is built inside a 17th or 18th century church, but the interiors are very well done with a mix of ancient stone and modern gloss finish. Very comfortable and made me feel close to European culture.",positive

The staff were very good and very attentive with good service. The hotel was in an excellent location. The breakfast was also very good. Reasonably priced parking in a nearby location.",negative
"Some low ceiling beams, I bumped my head, I can't stand straight everywhere. Although two bedrooms, there is no door, limited privacy.

Location very pretty. Heater works fast, very nice. Host very friendly. Good coffee.",positive

Very pleasant staff. Comfy room. Lovely breakfast, good location",positive
"Modern and yet historical items everywhere. Love the quiet rural setting. Andre was such a good host. There isn't much of a selection in restaurants, but then it did not bother us. We had plenty from a market and cooked our own meals. Only wished we could have stayed longer. Dinant was unforgettable. Beautiful forest and countryside.",positive
"Old bathroom and toilet, pretty ruined and not very clean. I was wondering when the hair dryer would break down because it was quite old and damaged.  The smell in the toilet was terrible, they could invest in some cleaning products. The surprise was also a deposit of 100 Euros, I had not found this information before on the website, but there was no problem with returning the money at check-out.,

Very nicely furnished living room with a bedroom. Modern kitchen, with all the necessary amenities. Very friendly and helpful hotel staff.  The hotel where keys are picked up has a 24-hour reception and is very close to apartment. Pleasant surroundings (close to shops, restaurants).",positive

"At that day parking area was full. Hardly find where to park. But later I understand that was some kind of bicycle race and lot of guest was in hotel. So think this is just one time case.,

When I ordered hotel, did not expected much. Price was quite low. But when arrive, first surprise was that at lobby told me, that mini bar is free of charge (that's a good sign I thought :). Room was big, and quite new. Second surprise was that in room is coffee machine with capsules. This is quite rare even in 5* hotels. Best what I expected some ""3in1"" coffee. Coffee in capsules was really good. Bed was comfy.",positive

I had to cut my stay short because there was a loud wedding downstairs.,

The property is in an excellent location. It is within walking distance  to many restaurants and shops. 
The rooms are clean and have modern furniture and big TVs. 
The breakfast is among the best breakfasts I have had at hotels before. They serve everything from cold salmon to pancakes. 
The staff are very friendly and I could see they worked hard to make sure I enjoyed my stay.",positive

great location , very friendly host, well stocked kitchen, very clean and comfortable  apartment.",positive
"The staff were very friendly. Loved the new look of the drinking and social area,

That hotel had a very bad smell.The bed linen was dirty.The tv remote did not work due to the batteries.",positive

"Everything exceptional. Beautifully designed rooms, excellent breakfast, super friendly treatment. Location just a few minutes walk from Grand Place. Will definitely stay there again on a coming visit to Brussels.",positive

The breakfast is excellent : all fresh and high quality food.The lady off the house is very friendly.The atmosphere is very quiet and relaxing.",positive
Fantastic view and a great location,positive
"It’s a bit farther out from the old town center than expected. Coaches, buses, and trams stop right out front. There is also a large Ferris Wheel from the zoo so there are a lot of people waiting around at all hours. Was awoken by an accidental call from the front desk at 1:00 in the morning for a pizza delivery that I didn’t order. Please match names and not just room numbers before calling rooms. ,

Clean, with a very nice staff, and good size room. Directly across from the zoo and train station. Quiet, especially considering the location. All public transport, city bikes, and electric scooters are just out front. Good value for money.",positive
"I did not realize the booking with for the basement of the host family. The photos do not paint an accurate picture.,

Friendly staff. Interesting to have animals nearby.",negative
"Perfect accommodation in the city center. Spacious and very well equipped apartment with balcony. You feel like at home, but in Busel. The reception is at a nearby hotel where you will be asked to pay a € 100 Euro deposit during check-in, which was returned after check-out. Everything works very well and reliably. I warmly recommend.",positive

Convenient location, easy access and communication with owner, secure garage available.  Warm apartment, neat and stylish with everything needed for short stay.  Immaculate furnishings and cleanliness showed care from owner. Lovely touch with wine, beer, milk and water in fridge. Close to all amenities but still very quiet and peaceful in apartment. Tourist information in apartment. Will definitely be back.",positive
"Thought it was all great. Did go for a drink at midnight when we arrived and bar was closing but that’s fair enough really.,

Amazing hotel we really enjoyed our stay. Bed and pillows comfortable and breakfast was very tasty.",positive
"Communication with staff for arrival time could be better.,

The guesthouse is very relaxing and charming. The bed was incredibly soft and comfortable. If you are nervous of heights, the stairs are quite steep and slippery in socks to the bedroom - I would recommend for the owners to put down some sort of gripped material on the steps. Also, you have to be careful to not get water all over the bathroom with the shower head.",positive
"The hotel was immaculately clean, quiet, and comfortable. Mario was a wonderful host and made a delicious breakfast for us. We have been used to breakfasts where guests help/serve themselves but this was a nice touch to have a host serve. Mario offered us a map for orientation to walk around the area and find landmarks and also provided a list of some recommended restaurants. We had a great stay at Art de Sejour!",positive

Great location. Modern decoration and very clean. Great views. Fantastic communication and Karin made us very welcome - couldn’t fault it",positive
"Messed up with forgetting to order breakfast, make sure you pre book as breakfast for my family was nearly as much as I’d paid for the room.  No concessions for 13 year old and 6 year old so 17 euros each we was only there 10 mins.  Took 130 credit flash of my card which took over a week to return back seems excessive.  When I paid my bill in full should be automatic back then.  ,

Stayed a few times before, food and bar great.  Family room was one of the best I’ve ever stayed in.   Great stop off on way back from Italian alps.  Right next to the motorway but a posh hotel not your typical motorway stop off.",positive
"Nothing really ,

Great Location! Unique setting, Tiny house against the church walls. Flexible staff.",positive

Wonderful position next to the city centre.
The owner is very kind and professional: couldn't ask for better",positive

"Pillows.,

Breakfast was fantastic.",positive
"I would have preferred a sofa in the living room rather than two seats. This is nitpicking though, it's a great guesthouse.,

It's a lovely one bedroom house all to yourself. Comfortable bed, coffee machine, good shower, quiet location but super centrally located. The old church walls are the interior walls for much of the property, providing quirky architecture and loads of charm. Would stay again.",positive
"We liked everything ,

Style, kindness, cleaning. The rooms are elegant, modern, big and stylish. High quality breakfast. We allowed for late check out with no additional charge.",positive
"Everything is good, that's probably the best hotel I've ever stayed.,

AWESOME! Best offer in the area for the price. A quiet, beautiful place suitable for any kind  of travel. Big room, bathroom is as big as some hotel rooms are. Breakfast is big as well and full of natural products.",positive
"The staff was great, very clean room, great location, nice breakfast with amazing canal view",positive
Great location and good service,positive
"1. The address was given as 91-93 Avenue Louise. You check in there but the apartment is several hundred metres away at 9 Rue Florence. Not helpful with a suitcase, rain etc especially if your taxi has left!
2. The mezzanine arrangement is a horror - suitcase up those hazardous tiny stairs! 
3. Far too expensive at €200 a night,

It was very clean and modern and everything I needed was there",negative

Super location, clean, milf in the fridge & wine on the table, Smashing beds!",positive
"It displayed in our welcome book that we were able to purchase drinks from a vending machine but when we went to go find it, it was no longer available at the hotel to guests, we had to go to the bar to purchase anything further, which for us at the time was not what we wanted to do, we would have really enjoyed a night in the room by ourselves.,

Location was easy to find, beautifully situated and the grounds, room, facilities was really great to experience, the room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was extra but well worth the money spent. The extra touches like tea, coffee, water, beer and cool drinks for free was exceptional.",positive
"Mario was an incredibly thoughtful, hospitable and welcoming host. He takes incredibly good care to make sure that you are comfortable and has your needs met, while also going above and beyond making sure that hygiene and health standards are kept during these Covid-19 times for the health and safety of everyone staying there.The rooms were spotlessly clean, incredibly comfortable, and the location is perfect - short walking distance to the city centre and many other points of interest, while also quiet enough for a good nights sleep. Public parking is also conveniently located across the street, which was great for us since we travelled by car.If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, hospitable stay while in Brussels I couldn't recommend Art de Sejour enough",positive

Good proximity to the Central Train Station.   Good general location.  Comfortable bed.  Breakfast was good.",positive

All good, especially the cinematic theme, ...",positive

Classic and classy",positive
Regendouche was defect,positive

apartments ideally located in the centre of town. Well kitted out kitchens with everything there for self catering even though many restaurants locally",positive

Excellent location, right along side the E40, with ample safe parking. Welcomed by friendly attentive staff, the room was large, warm and clean. Beds and shower were excellent. Food was also good. I can’t fault this hotel. It is excellent !",positive
"Nothing,

Mario has renovated this property brilliantly. He is an unbelievable host who is caring and efficient at the same time. Our room had a very interesting bathtub which fills from the bottom rather than the conventional tap. The room was beautifully appointed and the back window looked into a garden where fairy lights lit up at night. The breakfast was individually prepared to each person’s wishes and was plentiful and fresh. We would definitely recommend Art de Sejour to anyone who wants a five star experience in Brussels😊😊😊",positive

Very nice hotel, located in the centre of Antwerp. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Also the interior was amazing, well decorated.",positive

The location of the hotel was smack bang in the centre, which was awesome. Very clean and spacious junior suite. Helpful staff.",positive
Excellent,positive
"Nothing .,

Liked all the little extra touches about the apartment .the owners have given it a feel of home from home .would definitely stay there again .",positive

This accommodation was so far the best of all previous trips!,positive
"No milk in room
No iron to use in room",positive
"There is no amenity kit in the bathroom, something I normally wouldn't even notice. The same holds for a place to put the soap or a toothbrush. The heated mirror kinda makes up for it.,

Room was very clean, spacious and well designed. We were offered either a room at the front or the back of the hotel, where the latter would be more quiet. We choose one at the front and there was no noise at all, the city is very quiet overall. The availability of a Chromecast on the tv was a nice suprise. Staff was friendly and the breakfast was very good! Lots to choose from and all very tasty.",positive
"Didn’t quite understand their politics in term of changing the sheets.  I didn’t ask for room cleaning the first day but for the subsequent 3 days they didn’t the room without changing the sheets.,

The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city and close to 2 metro’s stations.",positive
"The swimming pool and spa is not owned by the hotel and can therefore only be utilised with extra charges.,

Location is perfect and the hotel is beautiful! All the staff are super welcoming and friendly, we even received 2 complimentary cocktails in the bar. I very much enjoyed my stay. I would definitely return and recommend it to friends.",positive
"This is a difficult review because we like the Van Der Valk chain of hotels. Everything was fine, including the food, except for the restaurant staff on a busy Saturday night. But we had a booked table and turned up on time. We were pretty much ignored, had to ask twice for everything and wait for everything. After 1.5 hours at the table, we had received only our starter. We gave up and asked for the bill. No apology, no questions, the bill was plonked wordlessly on our table. Rarely have we experienced such poor service. The problem I believe, lay with the restaurant manager who did not manage her staff.We complained to the manager at the time (she was dismissive about the whole business and said we hadn't been waiting long!).We complained the next morning to the reception staff and they were excellent, accepted the complaint, took notes and refunded the meal cost (which was not the reason for my complaint).Maybe we were just unlucky, but it shouldn't happen in a quality hotel.,

The hotel, the location, the decor, most of the staff and the comfort.",positive
Excellent location close to everything. The host gave us a little map and some dining recommendations that turned out to be great. I would definitely stay again.,positive

Good continental Breakfast. Great location. Friendly helpful staff.Would stay there again",positive

"Single room size is larger than expected. Location is really nice. Most of the main attractions are in close proximity. You can take boat ride from few steps away. Main attraction ""Markt Square"" is almost 300 steps away. I was occupying room with market view. Its a nice cozy place. Highly recommended.",positive
"Really liked the design of the hotel. The location was also perfect, everything within walking distance of the city centre. Very helpful and friendly staff.",positive
"They need more staff in the restaurant for better service, and an automatic coffe machine. Parking outside is NOT safe, a friend of mine had his car opened by a thief and things were stolen! Better park inside the hotel.,

Big room, clean, friendly staff, nespresso coffe machine, iron, kettel,...",positive
"No complaints.,

Very spacious room. Comfortable bed. Clean. Courtyard facing room was very quiet. Slept very well. Helpful staff. Free drinks on my birthday :)",positive
"The property was perfectly located, with all of Brussels main tourist sights no more than a 15 minute walk away. The room was spacious and the shower was amazing with a large and comfortable double bed. Mario is a simply amazing host , offering you a range of breakfasts each morning, an all inclusive mini bar in the room and giving you a map, talking you through the must see sights and where “tourist traps” are located! Two nights just wasn’t enough, we shall be returning soon !",positive
"Poor shower!!! ,

It's location.",positive
"Liked everything.,

The decor was outstanding - so different then the usual hotel decor. The location was very good - a street away from the Central Station. Since it was not in the historic area, we took taxis many times in addition to taking the metro which is excellent.",positive

Close to everything, staffs are nice, and let me check in earlier coz my flight arrived early in the morning.",positive

Breakfast was made to order in view, fresh smoothies every morning, fresh made fruit salad, plentiful croissants and crusty rolls, all delicious",positive
"I only wish there could have been hot water for me to have a shower/bath. I was in Room 334 but had to ask my friends in Room 333 to use their shower.,

Breakfast and location both excellent. There was less food available for our last morning, but it was enough.",negative
"The neighborhood around the hotel can feel a bit unsafe at night.,

Located very close to Antwerp Central. Great design and very friendly staff.",positive
"It is an old hotel so expect stains on the carpet and old TVs where you can not stick your USB stick.,

The room was really spacious. Bathroom was perfect. Additional towels, slippers and blankets were provided. The heating was good.",positive
"The pillows were way too soft ,

Good breakfast, rooms were clean and the staff were very polite.",positive
"Nothing,

Loved the feeling of total privacy, yet knowing there was someone there to help you if need be.Everything was well thought out - from the coffee maker to the roomy, spotless decor, and warm lighting. It was wonderful to wake up to the aroma of rolls and croissants baking downstairs!  Would highly recommend this all my friends.",positive

We spent a beautiful weekend there. We will come back for sur.",positive
"The area outside is undergoing renovations but out of host control. Long term only a good thing for his business.,

A beautiful property well situated for walking around the city. Beautiful decor, with an artistic blend of old and new. The facilities were of a high standard and could not fault a thing. Our room was large and even had a dressing area, tea and coffee maker, fridge with complimentary drinks. Bathroom was modern with a walk in shower and toiletries and the towels and dressing gowns smelt divine!! Mario was a wonderful host and spent time explaining where to visit in and around the city and the places to avoid! We are so pleased we chose to stay there!!",positive
"food available at other times of day would be nice,

very good",positive
"It was a little costly, but I do think you get what you pay for,

Nice, very central (just outside Anterpen centraal), clean, comfortable, very big and nice breakfast buffet (you can make your own waffles). We asked for a quiet room and did actually get it even though there was plenty of life outside the front of the hotel, but we slept nicely.",positive
"We arrived at night and neighborhood around was quite scary.Better walk there overnight.We asked for an umbrella but no one mentioned it as a paid option.,

Location was quite good as well as breakfast.We arrived late but there was a possibility to check in.The room itself was very good and clean.",positive
Room,positive
Super friendly and helpful staff.,positive
"nothing to improve,

A beautiful place, huge in size with great fixtures and fittings and a very helpful host.",positive
"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights. We liked everything about this property. The first thing that catches you is the clean smell as you walk in the room. The architecture of the rooms are well thought out with tall ceilings and clean artistic designs. The towels smelled delicious. The second thing was the breakfast. The vitamin shots every morning did the trick. Finally, the host, Mario was the best. He guided us about everything. Where to walk, what to see, where to get the best beers and the best food. Our stay was everything we were looking for. Very relaxing. We will surely visit again.",positive
"Noisy front room, slow lifts, awaiting extension works ,

It’s location and the staffs friendliness",positive

"Restaurant a bit overpriced.,

I was upgraded to a Junior suite. Very nice of them!",positive
"We got a room for a really good price for what was stated clearly as 2 adults and 1 child (both in the Booking website and in the email confirmation).
When we arrived at around 8 pm, reception staff told me we had to pay an extra €25 for my son's bed.
When I complained and showed the email confirmation, I was pointed to wording all the way down in the email  saying that ""charges may apply"".,  When I complained again and told reception wording should be made a lot clear, they shrugged it off and didn't even blink to charge me.
Very deceiving and really poor custome experience from the staff at reception.
Not going back.,

Anything nice was clouded by very poor handling of charges.",negative
"What I did not liked:
Pretty much the morning front desk staff « Jean » if that is even his real name. His behavior is really uncomfortable from the check in to the check out! He has one word on repeat « I will charge you » for pretty much every sentences he said. I’m a paying costumer I did not ask anything for free. I have never heard this word so much without even asking for anything. Fast forward at breakfast I went downstairs with my robe and slippers. He stopped me got up and said in a mean way “where are you going like that”? I replied breakfast? Oh no you cannot go to breakfast like that and better take it in your room. Then at check out he called my suite 5 minutes before the agreed check out time to press me out in a really stressed way (mind you I was packed with no intention of staying). When I asked for help for my luggages he said he had no one and did not proposed to help. In the suites there is no elevator only stairs so I said well i can’t bring them down only then he proposed to help. Not sure what is the deal with this man but that is not my problem. Like I said I’m a costumer, I’m extremely polite, quiet and respectful of everyone. I will not condemn anyone behaving this way with me no matter what the issue is with him he should not bring that to work and give a bad experience to innocent costumers who choose to stay at hotel Manos and happen to be there during his shift. I loved the hotel, I will come back but hopefully he is coached by then! ,

What I liked:
I booked a suite lovely and charming deco. I wish there was another ac unit in the living room but I managed to use the one in the bedroom to cool down the entire suite. Loved that there was even a piano.
The staff was excellent made me feel home all really helpful as well except « Jean » (see bellow). The location is great near Avenue Louise. I was there during covid so there is not much to say about the facilities beside that it is really charming and clean. Can’t wait to come back when they fully re open! Coming from the US were most things re opened it was a bit hard since in Brussels they are still pretty closed.",positive
"There are two Corbie Hotels in the city even if I typed the address of the other one in booking.com I landed at this hotel and booked it by mistake.,

Very friendly and helpful staff.",positive
"Great hospitality, wonderful and romantic room, perfect breakfast with view!",positive
"Nothing we would go again if we were staying in Brussels. ,

Room and bed was large and roomy. Well appointed and lovely decor and some 5* hotels aren’t this nice! We were in room 2 and one room on each floor. 
Everything in the room is included already (water; etc). Modern set up, very well maintained and clean. Bathrobes were lovely fluffy and good for us tall people. 
Mario was amazing and helpful and you can see a lot of thought has gone into the place and set up. His helpful tips of where to go and what to see were also really helpful as we were only there for one day/night before moving on. Communication from booking onwards was great and responsive.
Breakfast relaxing and you can have a light breakfast or a bit more if wanted. Easy to find and in the middle of everything and within walking distance of the train station.",positive
"Only 1 sachet of coffee, 1 teabag, 1 water & no milk, they didn’t give us clean mugs for the second day,

Very good location",negative
"No fitness. Poor breakfast,

Design",positive
"The mixer tap in the bathroom should be cleaned thoroughly - it was clean but There was built limescald that needs stronger chemicals to be removed. That was the only flaw which I saw - and it leaves an ugly impression as you immediately think that the bathroom and the room are not cleaned properly. But after my thorough (and quite expert :-)) inspectoon, I couldn’t find any other sign of poor cleaning techniques. So, it’s just that it wasn’t cleaned properly at some time and the limescale got built at the parts if the tap that are harder to reach. That is what they need to improve. Everything else was really correct.,

A former cinema building turned into a hotel which explains the film memorabilia as the main decoration theme. The hotel is clean, the room was spacious, the bed and pillows were comfortable. They offered fancy toiletries in the bathroom, the staff is smiling and efficient.",positive
"Service at the bar or breakfast is not the level you would expect for a 5 star hotel,

Breakfast is at the level you would expect from one of the best hotels in Brussels",positive
"Staff (Katrin or anything similar to it) during the check in, she was not nice at all... 
There was a gentleman, withour namebadge he was nice and kind... At least tried to help.
I did stay in room 327 it was nice experience, but this time I did request quite room, they give a room next to the motorway... Could not sleep and extremely unhappy. ,

Staff during the check out was different, she was extremely happy and she was keep saying apologiesses which made me feel she cares about her job and her hotel...",negative

The bed was really comfortable",positive
"I didn't like the fact that there is no place from where to grab some minimum food/snack or minimum drink open overnight and the bar inside the room was empty also. I believe either having some minimum drinks/snack in the bar inside the room or some automatic fridge in the hotel hallway would be a great backup for guests after the restaurant closes.,

The staff was great, the room was very clean and cozy, the interior was very nice, all small things were contributing to a really nice experience (for example: the hair-drier was a quality one, there were clean, comfortable bathroom robes etc). The breakfast was great, loved it! Overall a very good experience, I recommend it.",positive
"Only 1 set of towels left in the room found another set in the wardrobe ?,

Lovely rooms - spacious, comfy bed and clean",positive
"I understand the invasion of Chinese group tourists, but as a private guest I don't really like it.,

Good location: close to about everything, Spar 400 meters, restaurants about 1 kilometer. A good place to start walking.
The house has everything you need, nice fireplace in the living.
Probably 4 people is a maximum for a comfortable stay, but as I was alone with my dog, it was perfect.
Bathroom pretty much OK.
Wifi was good!",positive

"Breakfast selection was very good but service of milk, hot water and coffee was chaotic. I suggested these should be available self serve. On two days food that that should have been hot was cold. On the third day - after complaints - everything was hot.,

The bedrooms' comfort and design.",positive
"It was perfect. Nothing here. ,

Spacious, clean and luxurious",positive
"Room doors are quite noisy so if other guests have very different schedules than yours, it might be an issue. We could ear the music from the next room, luckily it was of our taste and not too loud neither till late, but again, that might be an issue.,

Very nice and spacious room, comfortable big bed and washroom with a great shower. No TV, but plenty of magazines to kill the boring moments. Perfect position in a quite area few steps from the historic city centre. Acces via code instead of keys works very well and you don't need to worry about losing them! We followed the suggestion of the host to have breakfast at the Café Mundi and it was excellent.",positive

The location was fantastic and it was comfortable,positive
"Some of the staff was very polite, but some of the staff was unpolite, especially when appeareantly it got busy and I wanted to check out. I asked for the corporate invoice and said that I will write the requisites, then person servicing the checkout said that I am asking too many questions at the time and he can't answer all of them, so I need to wait. Even though I was the only person he was talking to and I didn't ask any questions, I just wanted an invoice. Then he said that appearantly someone had already paid for the rooms. This probably meant that I couldn't paid for the rooms. When I said, that I paid for the rooms through booking.com, he become more polite, but still was very bothered by the fact that we need to leave 4 bags and will pick them up later on. Then we also tried to used the interactive service in the room and order drinks which offered 2 options to recieve the drink - ASAP or later. We have chosen ASAP, but half an hour later still without the drinks, we went to the reception and they didn't notice that we have ordered the drink. So do not use the application if you want drinks asap.,

Nice location, good breakfast, comfortable room with complimentary water.",positive
"Breakfast wasn’t included in our price and €15 seemed a little steep for a buffet breakfast if all you wanted was toast or cereal - maybe a continental breakfast to be included?,

Clean, spacious, good beds and great service.",positive
"The bathtub and bathroom was great but there was an overpowering smell like dirty socks. ,

Decor was nice. Noise level a little high with traffic.",negative
"The only tricky thing for some people might be the fact that in winter the only heating is via pellet/wood so you have to keep adding to keep the place warm and regulation of the temperature is very limited. Also pity there's no toilet in the upper floor where all the bedrooms are located.,

Fantastic place. Really nice/clean and well maintained. The outside terrace was also lovely, in unfortunately we couldn't use it due to weather/season. The owner is very punctual. Close to Domaine de Chevetogne and all together in the middle of rural nature.",positive
"Very nice rooms, with a beautiful breakfast place.",positive

"We absolutely loved our stay here last week!! Better than all the 4-star hotels I've had! Thank you so much, Mario!
Location: it's very conveniently close to Grand Place, Mannekin Pis, the Christmas markets, shops, museums, metro, and Eurostar station. The area also felt safe and quiet so sometimes we end up going out for a walk until the late at night.
Room: very spacious and elegant room. Very well lit and decorated nicely. The ceiling was really high. Our bed was very comfortable and the room has blackout curtains so we ended up sleeping like a baby for more than 8 hours!! The bed linens and pillows smelled very nice and fresh! Our room had a computer (Mac) so we were able to use it to browse the internet during the evening. Wi-Fi in the room was very fast. There was a coffee machine and tea bags provided and milk is also available in the fridge. Our fridge had soft drinks and water available too. I really liked the chocolates (Amande) and biscuits (Speculoos) that were provided next to the coffee machine. In the shower room/toilet, they provided L'occitane products which was a very nice touch. Again, the towels and bathrobes provided were clean and fresh-smelling. Toilet and sink are very clean and pristine condition. The waterfall shower felt very nice and relaxing!
Breakfast: we looked forward to our breakfast every morning! The breakfast room is always so clean and the ambience is relaxing. The seats are very comfy and the plates and cutlery are also very nice and clean too! Mario (the owner) would make us smoothie shots first thing, which was very fun and refreshing. After which, you can choose to have fruit salad or go straight to hot food. My fiancé would always have the fruit salad first and he said they were sweet and fresh and non-slimy! As you can see from the picture, the croissant and bread are provided with butter and different jams. You can choose to have eggs and Mario will cook them to your preference.",positive
"A general dearth of plug sockets-one on only one side of the bed, one at an awkward waist-height location with no table nearby, and one in the bathroom. The bathroom also had a see-through door. It was blurry glass, so you couldn't see everything, but it's more than clear enough to see the general shape of your partner sitting on the throne on his ipad. Not to mention, the sound is clear enough to hear through clearly. Kills the romantic vibe somewhat! The coffee tasted like instant, and while the room itself was beautiful, the ground floor hallway looks very scruffy and needs a refurb. I requested a certain room well ahead of time for the cosy aesthetic and the beautiful canal view, and although the staff were able to give it to us, they were unable to confirm it until the day of arrival. As the rooms were not ridiculously expensive but definitely not cheap, I would have been very annoyed to turn up and find out I couldn't have the room and that I had to pay over the odds for a generic-looking hotel room when I could have gone elsewhere for cheaper.,

I requested the ground floor ahead of time and the staff were kind enough to give it to us. The view over the canal, bridges and architecture from this room is beautiful-we did not know until we did a walking tour but the hotel used in the film In Bruges is next door, so the canal we could see from the window was the same canal Colin Farrell jumped into. There are frequently swans and ducks floating about under the window, which was nice. The room was toasty warm at all times even when it was freezing outside, which is great for a basement/ground floor, very clean, the shower was good and there was also a bathtub. There was a lot of lighting in the room-over each side of the bed, the whole bed, the whole room, the table area, the sofa-so you can pick whether you want romantic lighting, reading lights, general light, etc. The bed was huge, and very comfortable. My partner who is a bad sleeper found it excellent for sleeping undisturbed by my moving about or my (alleged) snoring. There is also a sofa which converts to another bed, a small table with two chairs, and another smaller sofa built in to an alcove. Despite all this, there is plenty of floor space because the room is pretty massive. The breakfast was pretty good and varied. There are some lovely bars and squares nearby if you exit and head away from the main square, as well as a good bottle shop, lots of chocolate shops, the torture museum, pretty bridges and a hotel bar (though we didn't go in, it looked good). The wifi was also very good.",positive
"We asked for recommendations of places to eat and the staff did not seem to have many suggestions. It would be helpful to have information about the area around the hotel and to give ideas on things to see, places to eat, help with the trams etc,

Large choice of items at breakfast including gluten free.Hotel was a couple of minutes from the central station so very conveniant",positive
"The common area close after 23:00. No place to have a seat to do some leisure stuff. And the WiFi signal is only at the common area.  The signal at bedroom area is very weak. ,

Showed in the bedroom is really good.",positive

Very comfortable, relaxed, great price, great location, nice breakfast with plenty of variety. Would definitely stay again",positive
"The only thing to slightly let it down was the selection of breads at breakfast as they were rather hard, we would have liked some softer rolls or a toast option, but this would not stop us returning.,

Everything was great",positive
"The matresses were indeed a bit hard, but I don't think it's a big deal since this is a hostel which was great, good price in comparison to others and it was very clean. A bit more ""decoration"" could be nice, as the rooms were a bit cold, but that is just a very small thing.,

Breakfast was great, the location is fantastic when coming with the train and you can walk into the centre pretty quickly. Extremely nice staff, very helpful! The rooms could be a bit more ""cozy"", concerning the decoration etc. But that is just an extra, after all it is a hostel so a clean sleeping place is great! Also good thing was, that the bathroom and shower were separate but still in the room, so no weird through the hallway walking for a shower. Very nice!",positive
"Great localisation, big room, comfortable bed, quiet place, easy check-in, clear and helpful information from the host",positive
"The noise of the highway,

Right near on a highway...nice staff but noisy place, and not really great view...",positive
"- No shower
- Not suitable for elderly or disabled people
- Not suitable for small children
- Not suitable for people with astma or other longdiseases
- Really small garden which is more smaller than you think because of the fact the owner uses the most part of the garden for own use. Further the garden is full of rocks and therefore not suitable for children. No children playingparts or BBQ in the garden
-Kitchen sink and cookingpart not clean
- Garden roof is full of birdpoop
- No heater only charcoal of which there is no drain! The owner has made a simple drain to the bedrooms upstairs instead a drain outside the home that the smell will go outside the home. So bad for your health! Home is not ventilated and therefore in the morning your mouth smells like tar
- No modern stuff like USB drive, XBox etc.
- No large mirror downstairs in the bathroom or outside the bathroom where the wasmachine is
- House really not regarding environment and health rules
- No nice view. In the garden you only see other houses and from the living room you see the street and other homes
- Area nothing to do, no shops, no baker, no supermarket etc.No bank, no ATM. If something happens there is nobody in the area you can go to/ can help you
- No trafficlights and bad roads so if you come in the dark to the home it is dangerous
- Animals allowed 
,

- The gentle manners of the owner. We had not sufficient cash for the deposit only 250 euro which he accepted and we got back when we checked out a day earlier.",negative

Foul smell in part of the hotell,positive
"Would have liked a full (non-hand held) shower but amazing bath made up for it.   A window would have been essential if I had stayed more than one night.  Essentially, I was in the attic with velux windows. This may have explained why the wi-fi was a bit intermittent.,

Friendly staff. Cosy room. Warm. Good breakfast. Great bath. Coffee machine. Didn't have time to try the fitness room or spa.",positive
"A little bit expensive for what you get,

Nice hotel, clean rooms, good WiFi even on the 5th floor, subways nearby",positive
"There is no Wi-Fi available in the rooms due to which we have to face a lot of trouble to come down for a single call or video chats with our family.Even If we have to check mail or access internet we have to go downstairs.,

The reception refurbishment work is good but I think the hotel has lost its cosy appeal.",negative
"nothing,

A charming and elegant hotel in a nice area of Brussels. I stayed there twice this year. My first experience made me make a reservation for the second stay and we were very pleased again. Our room had extremely comfortable beds, had an extra seating area, was decorated with  style and feeling for detail, with lovely artworks and antiques  throughout. It was lovely to have a private terrace with a view on an amazing garden, so surprising in a densely build urban neighbourhood.  Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. The staff were helpful and polite. We wish we could only stay longer there!",positive
"Although the hotel is situated on a main street, the distance to Grand Place is around 1.5 km and you have to pass an area under construction.,

Initially I got a room overlooking the inner courtyard and the heat installation did not work. The next day, the manager offered us another room overlooking the boulevard and also gave us a discount for the first night. I appreciated the manager's promptness.Rooms overlooking the boulevard Adolphe Max are very bright. Bathroom products are from Nuxe brand.Breakfast is good and staff are very kind. The room is equipped with a coffee maker (including coffee capsules) and a tea kettle.",positive

"I am staying 3 or 4 times a year in this hotel for business, I appreciate a lot, never had to claim, but this time I was very disappointed. First, the bed in my room (217) really needs to be changed, too old, not confortable, I slept very bad. Second, I had a bad ""waste water"" smell in the bathroom. Third, when I left the hotel nobody asked me if everything was OK, as if it is supposed to be... I someone asked me - as a client - if it's OK I would have told them, but it seems nobody cares. I will let a chance and go there once more, if I'm disappointed again it will be last time.,

exceptionnel breakfast choice and quality",negative
"The air con made the room smell a little odd so we kept it off.,

"Great location, clean rooms and friendly staff.",positive
Very friendly staff.  Well and thoughtfully designed!,positive
"From the moment you enter from the rather plain street,  you will be surprised by the romantic and stylish courtyard. My welcome by the hosts was warm and accommodating and  I was amazed by their excellent taste in furniture and decoration - all very stylish, quiet tones and with great eye for detail. As opposed to the bigger chain hotels, it is very personal and cared for, which also goes for the very comfortable rooms. I was sorry I was there for business because it would have been the perfect romantic get-away. But then, I’m sure to go back.",positive

Simple but clean and comfortable. Perfect location. Recommended!,positive
"Despite repeated attempts our room continually smelled of SEWERS. This smell was coming from the shower waste.

Been before so location and convenience",negative

Location convenient. Room very clean and comfortable.,positive
"Friendly and helpful staff, lovely rooms and good location for exploring Antwerp, very near main shopping areas.",positive
"The bathroom wasn't that great. It was hard to take a shower and not have water dripping on the floor. Dripping is an understatement. Also the bathroom was in front of the room and it was not possible to close the door to the outside. We where by our selfs but if there are a lot of guest I woud not like the idea someone could just run into your bathroom.,

I loved the old building, it had a lot of character. The location was great only a few minutes away from the city center. The beds were very comfy.",positive

Nice owners. Very well finished. Close to beach and in town center. Pool. Dogfriendly. Nice breakfast despite Covid restrictions",positive
"Mario and Ivan were the most welcoming hosts! Location was perfect, they were very helpful at pointing out places of interest and restuarants. Our room was large and very comfortable, with a great coffee machine and drinks selection which was refreshed daily! Breakfast was simple but refreshing, the additional sample of fresh juice every morning was delicious. The boutique b&b has been lovingly  restored,  it felt like our home from home, we loved it.",positive
"It seems that the hotel is not well maintained. I faced several issues which one would be expected by chance - such as broken lift - but when it repeats might indicate that the maintenance is not taken seriously enough. However, I should admit that the hotel is fixing the issues quickly and the staff are very helpfull.,

It is located in the heart of the city. The hotel is in general clean and well decorated.",positive
Was able to check in earlier than expected and got a room with a nice view.,positive
"The whole house (apartment and breakfast room) was great. A newly renovated old-style house, clean and quiet. The breakfast was good but it could be a bit improved.

"Great central location.  Breakfast was ok, with great views, but the restaurant was outdated.",positive
"The apartment is on the second and third floor of a small house. The toilet and the bathroom are part of the upstairs bedroom, accessible via the main staircase of the house, and the toilet and the bathroom are not separated from the bedroom (no wall, no door).,

The area is nice, there are indeed several restaurants around, some of them quite good. The place was nice and clean, recently renovated, with nice furniture, the beds are all comfortable, coffee was kindly offered to us, the host was easy to reach and kind, it was easy to get the key, we could arrive at any time with this arrangement, we were happy about all this. The windows are well insulated, so despite the central location of the apartment, we had a quiet night. Thanks for a nice stay!",positive
"The check-in took quite long. I stood there about 15 minutes waiting for the two people in front of me and this is not the first time. I would really recommend some automatic/self check-in system. People should just get their keys upon arrival. There is nothing complicated in the hostel.,

Decent hostel next to the train station with all the basic amenities you would expect from a hostel. Rooms have space and hangers to put your stuff. Same with bathroom. There are recycling bins. Kitchen seems to be lacking.",positive
"Internet was a little intermittent at times (short dropouts). ,

Meticulously clean, nicely furnished and far more spacious than the photos suggested. Excellent shower, and very well located for the old town. We stayed as a family of 4 (2 young children sharing a bed - both are king sized) and it worked very well. Plenty of places to eat nearby (there is no kitchen at the property).",positive

Awesome place and owner was very accommodating due to arriving a little later and leaving super early.

We had a large suit, very comfortable with windows to the garden. The breakfast is rich with a polite service.",positive

Confort",positive
"The stove is missing. To our opinion, the lighting in the dining room was not enough to read.,

Instructions on entering the appartment were perfect. Beds are very comfortable. Very spacious place to enjoy the evenings. Perfect location as the main sites, including opera house, were at walking distance. Supermarkets and good restraunts are also not far.",positive
"We were woken up by the chatty cleaning ladies quite early in the morning,

Very nice place to stay to enjoy the seaside and tranquility of De Haan in winter season. Staff is very nice and welcoming. We'd recommend Hotel Rubens !",positive

"That I stayed in a different hotel a few days earlier when being in Antwerp. Next time it will be Indigo.,

Can very much recommend this hotel. I was blown away! I stay in about 30-40 hotels per year and this one was my favorite of all! It does not just feel like a hotel, but your home away from home. The decor in the hotel and esp the room was amazing and just like I would imagine my house to be. Every little detail was perfect, from the lamps and lighting, to the bed, sheets and duvet and pillows, to the reception and elevator.",positive
"The Nespresso machine requires some maintenance -> cold coffee.,

Friendly host – spacious although still cozy/romantic room - very clean – good breakfast",positive

Fantastic location, everything in walking distance. Comfortabke room, nice breakfast
Parking available",positive
"We were a group of 7 and were only provided with limited swipe cards for the out of hours entrance/back door. To top it off a couple of the swipe cards we were given didn't even work, leaving people in our group stranded outside (women, alone, at different times) in the middle of the night, not the safest.,

The room was fine and we really appreciated the staff member letting us check in after hours.",negative
"To me it was a bit strange to never see a host or even other people living at the hotel. Maybe I should have done more research before booking, but I was definitely not expecting this. Apart from this giving me kind of a weird impression, everything worked out fine: the code I got for the main door and room worked well and the room was decorated in chic nordic design. ,

Very nice room close to the city center. All the main attractions can be reached on foot.",positive
Overall very good experience but one major issue: wifi very slow and unstable which is a real liability for a business hotel,positive
"We stayed in room 67 and the access to the room safe was ridiculous. I had to lay on the floor and bend to get access around the wardrobe doors as they were so close to the bed.,

The staff were excellent and helpful at all times.",positive

"This is only a minor complaint but there was no mini fridge in the apartment.,

The property was very centrally located and easy to get to. The room was comfy, spacious and clean and we loved the modern furniture. We were on the ground floor with large light filled windows and surprisingly a quiet location of an evening.Communication with the host, Tobias was very smooth. Access to the property was easy through pin code. If in Antwerp again we would definitely choose to stay here again.I only apologise for our daughters tantrum on the last morning, but be mindful we had been travelling for several weeks before coming to Antwerp :-)",positive
"The hotel is located a bit in the middle of nowhere with very good access from the highway, but otherwise not much happening within walking distance. Anyway it is well connected and I was told there is a 10 min direct bus to Bruges. Really it is a hotel where it’s almost impossible to find flaws. 
,

Large and clean rooms, very friendly and helpful staff, fantastic breakfast. I really appreciated the soundproofing, although the hotel was full there was absolutely no sound coming into the rooms. It’s obvious everywhere that this hotel doesn’t cut corners: everything is of good quality. Also the small touches were very nice, like having some free drinks in the room.",positive

Comfortable bed, good spacious bathroom, nice range of drinks etc available in room.",positive
"It is a little noisy due to the trams running past immediately outside, but did not bother us greatly. We all slept very well in spite of this. ,

European elegance with extremely comfortable beds, decorated in style with lovely antiques and artworks throughout. Our suite was enormous, easily accommodating our two children as well and providing us with plenty of space to relax. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful, served in the beautiful conservatory. We wish we had longer here! The spa area is delightful, as is the terrace bar.",positive
"You had to pay 25 euro to use the swimming pool! Bad experience.,

Very big rooms, personnel very friendly.",positive
"Nothing much. A couple of minor things like no toaster and low quality toilet paper. Would have preferred a range of bedding options rather than only a doona.,

Place was so pretty and the design was perfect! Pictures don’t do the justice😇,positive
Very good breakfast with beautiful views of the canal.  Rooms were small but very comfortable.  The front desk personnel were incredibly helpful.  The restaurant within the hotel Christine's was very accommodating during our stay,positive
"I forgot how things work in hostels (making my bed by myself, no toiletries or towels in the room, except for toilet paper), but that's my problem. I paid more for a private room than I would have in a 1-star hotel with all the usual service, but there was no choice at the time of booking.,

Great location!",positive
"Thin walls ,

Amazing apartment in the perfect location",positive

Location and size. Decor and space.",positive

It was all great! 3 night stay and there was nothing that we didn't like! Great staff and location.",positive
"Could use more outlets. Needs hooks in the bathroom along with a shelf for bath products. One more fan would be nice as well.,

Huge windows allowed lots of fresh air and light when needed. Door code made it easy as we didn't have to mess with keys. Long dining table was great.",positive

Location excellent, close to all places of interest, breakfast was something to look forward to .Mario was the perfect host and provided us with a map indicating places where we  may like to visit.",positive

Amazing hotel. I even wonder why the relatively low score... Super modern facilities and very close to the city center, you can't complain!",positive
Rooms are clean and very well designed. Great location.,positive
"Lovely stay in the city center of Liege! Very comfortable and spacious room. The hosts were very kind and welcoming and even provided a small private “dining room” where we could have our take-away dinner and breakfast in the morning, very thoughtful and convenient during these covid-times. Definitely recommend this place!!",positive

"The showers are private, but you don't have a flow regulator,

Cosy, warm, regular hostel breakfast",positive
"The property was very centrally located .  Our host Tobias was very helpful and accommodating. 
A few minor changes would make this accommodation perfect. 
The pillows are terrible ! Needs softer pillows. A mini fridge would be very useful. Otherwise we would have no hesitation about staying here again",positive
Very good staff,positive
"The only problem was that every night, from midnight until 2 or 3 AM, many rowdy people would migrate from bar to home. We stayed there 7 nights and it never failed to wake us all up, usually multiple times per night. It was better when we shut the windows, which cut down on a lot of the noise, but it was too hot for us to do that. ,

Central location, clean, well appointed. Loved the Honesty Bar, where items like beer, nespresso pods and wine were in the flat and we could leave money to reimburse her. She answered all of my emails promptly. Overall, a great choice!",positive
"Mario aims to spoil his guests and certainly succeeds! Our room was gorgeous, extremely clean and so so comfortable.  Wonderful bathroom.  Bed/pillows/linens were very comfortable and high quality.  Fabulous breakfast is personally made for each guest. Great location/minutes to Grande Place. Train station at the corner.  One word sums it up......PERFECTION!",positive
"Nothing,

The Marivaux is very high quality, with friendly staff at a fair price.
Manager Tanguy Lambrechts was excellent when I left some property in the hotel, posting it back to me in the UK.
Thanks Tanguy!",positive

the room is nice. it exceeds my expectation regarding to the cleanliness.  the staff is so nice.  they helped me a lot.the hostel also provides the breakfast , breakfast is also good under this cost. the location just behind the train station and bus station, just 1 or 2 min's walk.",positive

Beautiful building, large room",positive
"Nothing,

Lovely place to stay, close to the old town 
Easy tram ride from the station
Well presented, bright and modern",positive
"That our stay was so short,

Where to start?   Tea and coffee at check in with Ivan.   Personalized map of recommended restaurants, awesome room with a heavenly shower ( this was the third establishment we stayed at... wish we could have spent more time here).  And breakfast...Mario started us with blueberry banana smoothie as a breakfast hors d’œuvre, croissants, yogurt and fruit.   And although I shouldn’t have, I had the smoke salmon too.   By far out favorite place.  We felt totally pampered.  And the dogs, if you’re lucky enough to meet them, are adorable.",positive

Clean and big rooms",positive

Close to the train station, decent beds",positive
"I had to change my keys 3 times. For some strange reasons my keys kept deactivating. It was just a small annoyance because everything else was perfect.,

Cleanness, courtesy and kindness of the staff. Everybody,  from the entrance to the reception desk makes you feel welcome. I got there early and to my surprise my room was ready!!!",positive
"Design, location, clean, quiet,",positive
"A stylish apartment, very modern but nonetheless complementary to its heritage.",positive
The staff were wonderful. They let us check into one of the rooms really early so we could go on with our day. They helped print our train tickets as well. Very helpful and friendly staff. We'll definitely be back.,positive
Friendly staff. Terrific location to train center.,positive
"Great host, I can highly recommend this Hotel! Perfect service ....",positive
Amazing channel view room !,positive
"Restaurant for evening dining isn't on the level it could be. Facilities do not reflect a 5 star Hotel dining standard. Unlike breakfast, where there is a great breakfast restaurant, the hotel lacks of 5 star dining facilities in the evening.,

Excellent breakfast and breakfast facility. Quality of food and service was great. Staff was very friendly and polite.",positive
"We had to go,

Cold beer in the fridge",positive

"Unfortunately we couldn’t get the grill and microwave to work. It didn’t matter so much as we went out every night.,

The beds were very comfortable and the linen of a high standard. The open-plan sitting room with kitchen was a nice space with a lot of natural light. The kitchen was well equipped with extras provided like coffee, tea etc. There was even a free bottle of wine in the fridge.",positive
"There was nothing to not like.,

Mario, our host, was delightful. The accommodation and hospitality were top notch. Breakfast was lovely. The decor, bathroom, and shower, amenities, orientation to the city - all excellent. Would absolutely stay again.",positive
"Hotel is very center of everything. Good location but old hotel. 😊 ,

Staffs are friendly and accommodating. Allowed us to check-in early in.",positive
"The Bulp/light in the bathroom that shines on the sink. Very bright for the eyes and too closeby. Maybe a lamp cover will help.,

the breakfast was excellent, lots of fresh fruits, cereals, eggs, waffle maker, fresh bread etc. Very nice restaurant!",positive
"Non,

Everything",positive
Value for money was quite good (only 6 euro at the time of writing),positive
"One window of room was broken, but could be fixed: Room had first to be heated up. Outside noise of urgency cars is very loud. Service in Loui Bar was not as good as expected in such hotel.,

The hotel has very comfortable and relaxing beds! It is situated on a quite noisy street, try to get a room looking to the court. Very good place to start visiting Brussels. There was a room ready at 10:30h am already!",positive
"No elevator.  The apartment is located on the 2nd floor (actually 3 flights of stairs up from the ground level), and the stairwell is narrow and winding, partially without a handrail, making it a bit difficult to navigate with luggage.  Not a huge deal, but a bit challenging.No washer or dryer in the unit. Again, not a huge deal as a laundromat is nearby. Apparently the floors are very thin and the slightest bit of noise can be heard by the tenants in the apartment below.  Twice I was contacted by a knock on the door (once at 5:30am) about my vibrating cell phone disturbing them.,

The location was awesome. There are multiple tram stops in very close proximity to the apartment; many Ghent attractions close by, and grocery markets, cafes and shopping within walking distance.  Carinne, the host, was very accommodating, helpful and super nice.",positive
"Not a thing ,

Everything 
Comfortable room 
Great Breakfast 
Wonderful Host",positive
"I think the hotel advertised that they change the bed sheets every day; As far as I know, this didn't happen with us. Otherwise, I have no other observations.,

The room was of a very good size, just like the bathroom, and had a nice big bed. We even had our own terrace/balcony to our room, which was a nice touch. We tried the breakfast and I'd rate it above average: the quality of the breads and the food that was offered was good. I do need to mention that the pancakes were a bit dry and the fruit juice did not taste artificial (so no grenadine was used) but wasn't fresh either. Probably Minute Maid or some other brand. As for the range of foods that was offered to us, I think it was definitely very good. We really liked the granola and appreciated the pain au chocolat and the pain aux raisins. The staff was correct in all the interactions we had with them.",positive
"The decor is lovely, really tasteful. Really enjoyed our stay :)",positive
"Nothing,

Warm and helpful hosts (thanks Veronique for the guidance about places to visit and to dine at). Very nicely restored house with tasteful decoration. Room was large and comfortable.Breakfast was excellent. We really enjoyed our visit.",positive
"The glass in the bathtub is not big enough, resulting in a lot of water falling out. The room could have been cleaner. I cannot by any means describe it as dirty; however there is room for improvement...,

The hotel is placed in a great position, close to every sight, in the heart of the town without letting the noise intrude it. Very comfortable, amazing architecture, especially in the breakfast lounge, which offered a magical view to the canal. Breakfast was one of the best I have ever had in a hotel. Extra credit for the really kind and helpful staff (especially the gentleman in the reception).",positive
Disappointing gym,positive
Excellent location but quiet; extremely comfortable and beautiful flat. The host has anticipated everything needed . Very easy to use entry process. Good communication from host throughout.,positive
Breakfast was excellent and the host accommodated our departure time by making breakfast early.,positive
"Windows a bit dirty, maybe, I ended by paying a bit more than what had been indicated by booking, but as I was really satisfied with the hotel I did not raise the question.,

Well decorated hotel, well managed, nice and comfortable rooms, good breakfast.",positive
Lovely friendly helpful staff. Great breakfast. Perfect location.,positive
"Even if located very close to the city center (5min walking distance), be prepared to walk uphill or climb hundreds of stairs. But it's worth it ;-),

It's a wonderful house located in front of the Saint-Martin church. The outside doesn't say much but once inside it's a real gem. The rooms are well decorated and are very comfortable. The view of Liège from the garden is amazing.",positive
Location could not be beat,positive
"The beds 🛌 are bed and the stairs looked awful 😞 ,

Lots of space",negative
"Nice and cosy flat, well equipped nice decoration , perfect to relax, Marjan give as a warn welcome and did everything to make our stay comfortable and perfect 
 We will definitely be back",positive
"Alles ok,

Comfortabel hotel",positive
"Heating didn’t work. It was warmer after I switched it off than before. Also breakfast was average for a hotel of such stature. Although, if I didn’t ask I wouldn’t have known that you can order an omlette for yourself at breakfast.,

Top facilities",positive
"If I have to say something, maybe some air condition could help if the weather is extremely hot, so we do not need to open the windows, when there is a lot of noise coming from the streets. And a little freezer also would be nice. But these are not really important, we had a wonderful stay there.,

It is a beautiful, very clean apartment, the land lady is very, very nice, she left us a bottle of rose wine as a wellcome drink, it was a nice gesture. The kitchen is basically new, perfectly equipped. She explained us everything, every information she gave us even before by mail was absolutely correct. We had a very good time there.",positive
"There was nothing to not like.,

Mario, our host, was delightful. The accommodation and hospitality were top notch. Breakfast was lovely. Would absolutely stay again.",positive

Everything else",positive
"Friendly staff, cute hotel, great location!",positive
"Excellent decoration and very comfortable rooms, very friendly People, nice home made breakfast.",positive
"We asked to use an iron but we unable to for the whole of our 3 night stay as other guests had it. ,

Very good location for central Brugge attractions. Quite basic but we only used as a base to explore. Good view of the hotel from our room.",positive
"Thin walls and ceiling.,

Big and comfy apartment. Great location next to Grotemarkt, with a great view. Communication with the host was very easy.",positive
"The flat has excellent facilities.  The owner, Marjan, makes you feel welcome right away.  She certainly has put her personal touch into everything, and it shows.   A coffee machine in the kitchen, with coffee pods provided, plenty of space to hang clothes and good storage. Overall a lovely flat to stay and will definitely back!!",positive
Room was comfortable and clean.,positive
"Access to the swimming pool was at extra charge. The pictures of the hotel showing the pool Male the impression that access is all inclusive.,

Personell was exceptionally great, friendly and receptive.",positive
"However, it is in the second floor with very dangerous stairs. The lights in the corridor inside the house did not work and the heater worked ramdomly. We asked the owner but she felt ill and nobody came to help us.,

The flat is is spacious and comfortable. It is in the center of Gent. It has all the things you need.",negative
"That we spent only one night.,

I can’t say enough good. The decor, bathroom and shower, amenities, staff, breakfast, orientation to the city - all excellent.",positive
"We were told at check in that breakfast was included but then at breakfast were then told it was nit included,

A nice atmosphere",positive
"Very nice hotel with relaxating rooms, perfectly located next to the Central Station, great service by friendly staff and most of all: wonderful breakfast!",positive
"Although there was a stand-alone AC in the sitting area, there wasn’t one in the bedroom. Being so warm, we slept with the windows open but the traffic noise disrupted our sleep.,

The host offered us a choice of 3 rooms when we arrived. The rooms are beautiful & the shower was fabulous! The host very helpfully gave us a map & list of restaurants. The guest house is very close to the centre of Liège & we were lucky enough to get a free parking space almost opposite.",positive
"Bit of a hike to get to the car park.,

Excellent central location, we were travelling by car and the charge for parking was reasonable.  We didn't have a canal side room but the view of the street was sufficiently entertaining!",positive
"Matrasse in the bedroom ... ,

Perfect location in Grote Markt, which is very center of historical Antwerp, in old typical building. Walking distance to any possible sight.
Staff was very helpful) 
Antwerpen is amazing place, highly recommended😊",positive
"Is amazing and I’m assure you, you will feel like you are in home",positive
"Too many stairs to reach the reception and to get to the room.,

Very central location; very helpful staff; well equipped and comfortable room.",positive
"House keeping (first day only),

Staff&locaion",positive
"Not a problem in colder days but the lack of freezer might have been annoying in the summer if one wants ice and icecream. As we were travelling as a couple a sofa rather than just armchairs would have been nice, although they were comfortable. These are minor points though as we were out most of the time and the neighbourhood is well stocked with cafes and eateries.,

Excellent communication from the owner. All the things in the flat worked. The fixtures and fittings were of generally high standard. Very spatious and nicely furnished. Keypad instead of keys makes it easy to split up a group and not worry about getting back in.",positive
"Nothing we didn't like,

Everything was perfect. The renovation was modern, stylish and elegant. The bed was extremely comfortable and the breakfast were delicious!",positive
"breakfast was average, I mean the quality of the breakfast was OK.For example the scrambled egg was OK but not great.The orange juice was canned rather than fresh, would have loved to have fresh juice than canned.,

excellent location in the centre, the wifi was great and the room exceptionally clean.The room was reasonably sized. Bathrooms big too",positive
"all good,

"More breakfast options.,

Central location. Excellent rooms. Breakfast was a little basic but acceptable. Friendly and efficient staff.",positive
"Stairs in the building is a bit dangerous and narrow. But it’s not the owners problem. ,

Everything is great. Location with many restos around. Room is very big and cozy. The owner is very friendly and quick answer by WhatsApp. Easy and quick self check in& check out.",positive
"The appartment had everything I needed, and more!The kitchen was neatly designed with all tools and appliances to cook a meal for yourself (but their are plenty of nice restaurants in the neighbourhood aswell...)The luxury design in an old house gives the appartment a nice cosy feeling.And the bathroom is a real eye catcher! Again beautifully designed, a very peaceful atmosphere.A pity I could stay for only 1 night, but next time when I'm in Belgium, this is definitly where I will stay!Thanks Marjan for the wonderful, warm hospitality!!",positive
"Well nothing since I came back,

It is my second stay (I had stayed 3 weeks the first time) and I am still equally satisfied. Small hotel in a very quiet neighbourhood, lovely staff,Spacious and very clean room. it has a microwave and some plates / forks, as well as Nespresso and boiler. So perfect for those coming on a business trip.",positive
"We booked this hotel because it had a swimming pool. Unfortunately our son was too young to use it - this is not advertised on Booking.com. The breakfast was also disappointing, particularly the quality of the muesli and the cooked breakfast, which tasted like it had been reheated.,

Good location, close to designer shops and the metro station. Bedroom very quiet, lovely bathroom and very friendly, attentive staff.",positive
"Wonderful, Fabulous, attention to every detail, and host friendly, helpful, and made a healthy breakfast as well. accommodations exceeded expectation w nice linens, computer, espresso machine in room, & grand shower.  Felt Very luxurious, calm, comfortable space to just be. Within walking distance of all the sites.",positive
"Nothing,

The hotel is very well located close to train/metro/bus station. Walkable distance to city center. I lived in Antwerp many years and I wanted to try this new hotel and I’m really satisfied. It is comfortable, cosy and fresh with many plants. The room was clean and toilet settings bath soap, shampoo, conditioner, body cream of a brand which has a lovely smell. Staff is very helpful, since I got with 4 luggages due to my move and they immediately helped me and store till check out. The restaurant is very good and food is fresh. There are many books in the room about secret street or path in Antwerp, best restaurants etc. They also booked me taxi for the airport. My last night in Antwerp was great in this hotel.",positive
Breakfast excellent. The room was absolutely exquisite.,positive
Great location,positive
"The steep stairs! Luckily we only had cabin trolley with us.,

Right on the side of the City Hall. Restaurants, shops &  sights at a walking distance. Screens on windows to prevent MOSQUITOS!!! Could be loud with the windows open. But it didn’t bother us. Fresh air is always nice in the summer.",positive
"Rooms were clean and well maintained. Breakfast was very good with multiple option for everyone's need.
It is right in the city center which is a great advantage.",positive
"No lift, so this time I got to stay in the upper floor and fully appreciate the narrow stairs. Smoking in the hotel tends to be a problem– someone does it on regular basis (I've noticed it on more than one occasion during several stays), and then the stink invades even to the above mentioned upper floor (perhaps through the canalisation as it is most noticeable in the bathroom)... disgusting. Also, I've stayed in various rooms, and every one has had an annoying flaw, a different one in each occasion. This time it was toilet that would not stop flushing.,

The hotel is well placed if you have business around Schuman and like to take the airport bus. The room is big, kept perfectly clean, has many useful amenities such as microwave, plates, tea kettle. On the plus side, they provide free toiletries during the stay, but keep only providing one packet of tea on the first day only no matter how long you stay (which used to be the case also with the toiletries, so hurray for the progress!). Water plentiful and instantly hot, bed comfy.",positive
"Water pressure was to low. Swimming pool not included in price.,

Beautiful hotel",positive
The whole place is perfect!,positive
"Great, quirky hotel with attentive staff. Great location if you need to be very close to the station.",positive
"The only very small remark is that the bed was a bit hard for our taste, but still good.,

Very cosy, tastefully restored old house. The room was excellent, silent, good privacy, nice and clean bathroom,...Very friendly staff, excellent breakfast (optioneel, 15€ pp extra).Highly recommended",positive
"Steps to the apartment were narrow, you have to be careful to not fall.It's a bit too bright even when you put down the blind, the light can pass through.,

The apartment is nice, spacious and clean.Easy check-in and check-out with the box.The location is right in the center.",positive
"Everything was exceptional.
The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, both over the phone and at the hotel. 
The location is perfect- right in the city centre, next to shops, tourist attractions, bars, restaurants, you name it.
The check in was easy and they allowed an early check in and late check out, free of charge. 
The room was nice, we were provided with slippers and robes once we requested them, and received a bottle of water daily, free of charge.
Since I spent my birthday there, the staff was kind enough to provide us with a room with an exceptional view on the top floor.
Chapeau, Novotel!",positive
"One of the cleanest hotels I have ever been in Brussels. Based in the European quarter, close to Schumann. Spacious rooms, tasty breakfast deliver directly to your room, all things you could need available in the room (fan, microwave, plates, forks and mugs). Coffee and tea complimentary in the room. 5+ star for me.",positive
"Not much to complain. Great place! Highly recommended. Check-in checkout personalized,

We stayed at Art de Sejour hotel for two nights March 23rd and 24th 2019. The hotel is about 1.0 Km from the Brussels Central Station. We took a taxi and it cost us 10 Euros. Our host Mario was absolutely wonderful. He communicated with me over the email and made me feel comfortable that the B&B would be open (the last check in time as per reservation was 7:00 pm) even though we were arriving past 11:00 pm. His response time to my emails was less than 2 hours.Our room was nice with all the amenities. The hotel has an elevator. Mario serves breakfast to all guests the selection is quite adequate. We were able to get to all the attractions by foot. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",positive
"Average breakfast choice. The restaurant is conviently located and nicely decorated with a cool patio for outside eating, but food could be improved,

Modest in size but all facilities needed are available. Very friendly staff, and clean facilities makes it a good choice if   you are looking for a central location. Decent Wi-Fi",negative

Spacious and clean room. Central location.",negative
"There was nothing I did not like, but due to the staircase, it's not an ideal place for travellers with heaps of luggage.,

Pleasant hotel, at walking distance from EU institutions, in quiet street. Spacious, clean, rooms with all imaginable facilities and if not in the room, the very kind receptionist will get them for you.",positive

Everything was perfect!,positive
Swimming pool not available,negative
"The only thing that wasn't great was the fact that there's no common space. This means you have breakfast in your room (and the breakfast was very minimal) and you can't sit in a lobby for a coffee or something.,

The hotel was actually better than we expected! The rooms were very spacious, quite and comfortable. The staff was friendly and the location was convenient.",positive
"1. The building doesn't have an elevator. A staircase is narrow and extremely steep. The apartment that we were staying at is located on the 2 floor. It might be ok for young people, but for older guests it's quite challenging. 
2. There was a construction site right in front of the building, so it was quite loud.,

Perfect location on the central square! The apartment is newly renovated and is fully equipped.  Everything was well organized,  we didn't have to wait for the check-in or check-out.",negative

Great staff, breakfast ""in the bed"", quiet room with a terrace",positive
"We were just one couple so for us it was great, but I think it might be slightly too small for 6 people: I would recommend it for up to 4 people.,

Very cosy chalet with all the necessary facilities, ideally located near several beautiful walking trails.Enough heaters to be comfortable even in the coldest week in years in Belgium!",positive
"All toiletries were virtually empty and needed refilling. Bathroom rather basic and lacked the effort of the main sleeping area. ,

Excellent extra effort by reception to accommodate a slightly early check-in.",negative
"The location of the property was extremely convenient, a couple minutes to many restaurants and shops. The host was extremely responsive and very pleasant to deal with. The place was clean and everything we needed was there! 
Super great experience!",positive
"A bit off for easy handling with credit cards. I found myself, after a long day driving, giving my card to the girl at reception. Don’t do that.,

The apartment was nice, like an office but nice, it’s Bruxelles. The breakfast good and the staff friendly . The Ambioirix square and the surroundings is a good place to stay.",positive
"Good location , well equipped. Very cozy home and very clean. Owners are really friendly. Good storage room and tools available for fixing and cleaning your bike.",positive
"The Toilet is very disgusting. It smelt too much urine as if it is a public toilet. Very dirty. Since i was travelling with a small Kid. Very bad.,

"nice environment , nice comfortable stay",positive
"The room was noisy thanks to the staff service entry across the hall (room #001), we were woken at 06:00 each day. 
The upstairs room plumbing made a lot of noise as well in our bathroom which was also disruptive.
Room 001's window faces the courtyard so we could not have the curtains open.,

The shower.",negative
Perfect,positive
"Missing smoke detectors, open front gate to the street, dirty couch, old furniture and apartment in need of refurbishing and touch ups. Staircase very bad state. Very loud from neighbours, no noise isolation.,

"Very nice hosts, we had everything we needed. Town of Houffalize (with shops, bakery, etc) nearby at 10 min drive.",positive
"Honestly, there is nothing we didn't like. We travel to Europe at least 2x a year for the past 20+ years and have never found any property like this or encountered customer service to this degree.,

It had been totally gutted and remodeled and was opened only a year ago and in perfect location. Simple gorgeous throughout.  Rooms lacked for nothing! High end touches, like toiletries provided, bedding, king size beds in all rooms,. Rooms are large and it is more like a condo,you have a separate bedroom, then walk through a large hallway with  closet with tons on space for storage, coffee and tea maker, refrigerator  which provided  free sodas and water bottles, bowls of high end chocolates and cookies. The bathroom is very roomy, with a large walk in shower, lots of space to put your toiletries. A bathrobe is provided and the towels are changed daily and are again high end. There are only 5 rentals and only one rental per floor on the 2,3,4 and 2 rooms on floor 1.  The rooms are quiet, you do not hear outside traffic or any noise from your rental above. The breakfast provided was delicious and you were given a choice of what you wanted to eat.  Eggs, meat, cheese, granola, greek yogurt, fruit and berries, Belgium waffles, assorted breads and croissants, smoothies. Because it is a very small BNB, there is no buffet. The owner was exceptional. He asked our plans for sightseeing and recommended a local guide that his previous guests had used and were so pleased with. The guide was very reasonable, 12 Euros pp for a 2 hour walking tour. We loved the guide and tour! The owner provided us with a list of nearby restaurants that were very reasonable and great food. We only ate from those restaurants and found them to be not only excellent but the portions were so large we split meals! We had problems finding a van for going to the airport at 4 am. He called a company for us that he knew was reliable and ordered the van! He even got up at 4 am to make sure the van arrived and gave us a sack breakfast. His customer service and the BNB went way beyond anything we have ever encountered in Europe.",positive
"Ok,

Nice",positive
"The staff was nice. I personally didn’t use the other facilities, but I love the fact that it was possible especially for the price. It was pretty much in the city centre. Less than 10 minutes walk to be in the centre and the nearest metrostation. Bathroom was nice, modern and clean. Walking distance from Manneken Pis.",positive
"There was no such thing! Perhaps the lack of lift but I was advised on that from the beginning and the staff was really very helpful in bringing my luggage to my room on the 2 floor!,

The location is perfect - 5-10 minutes walk to the main EU Institutions, Schuman area, shops, restaurants... public transport link very easy! The staff is extremely kind and helpful! I have really nothing to complain about!:-) Very clean facilities - bathroom and room cleaned every day. Super conditions for a very pleasant stay, whether for business or tourism reasons! Highly recommend to visit!",positive
"The accommodation was not properly clean. There were a lot of dog hairs spread all over the mattresses and pillows. There was a big stain in one of the bed sheets. The quality of the mattresses was not the best (too soft).The fireplace works very well but make sure you have enough pallets when you arrive at the accommodation (we had to use the electrical heating devices available on our first night due to the lack of pallets).,

The location of the accommodation is really good. The view is nice and the place is very calm and silently.",negative
Not that clean in breakfast area specially the cutlery and bords,positive
"They didn't have a map at reception,

This hotel was great value for money. The rooms were a good size and great temperature given the heat. Everything was in walking distance. The breakfast was lovely and the mushrooms were extra special",positive

Nice apartment",negative
"Tear wear signs. Smells ,

Comfortable apartment.  Much better than hotel room.  Very well located for European quarters. Few Irish bars nearby. Quiet location",negative
Nice spacious room. I liked the fact that several extra blankets were in the wardrobe. Everyone of the staff was very friendly.,positive
"We had to ride up the mountain from Houffalize to the house. Which is a chore when you just rode 100km and had a few beers afterwards.
So, no complaints, really:)
The only tip I could give: it wasn't clear to me that there were 3 seperate beds.,

It was a nice postcard house, with great staff. Who speak english too btw.",positive
"The street is very busy but we still had great night sleep despite of the noise which eventually dies down at night.,

Everything, all the little attentions provided by our hosts. Breakfast was perfect, room was a peaceful haven after a day of sight seeing. We loved our stay.",positive
"Not too much choice for breakfast and the swimming pool is not included,

Very nice room",negative
"the atmosphere of hotel was not happy (corona could be an important reason!). the staff are not that friendly but ofcourse polite and good enough. i wish there was a coffee machine in room but was just a kettle and other stuff ofcourse. they are tiny tips and all in all i will choose this place again,

i was completely satisfied with this hotel. it certainly is worth the money you pay. we were 4 in one bedroom(2 kids) the room was spacious enough and no worry for making noise.  the hygiene was very well. the location was perfect just near Grand palace(grote markt) and so many cafes and shops around. before booking this hotel i was wondering to choose this one or something twice as expensive but i am happy i went for this.",positive
"Absence of a lift to climb 4 floors. Could really be difficult with a large suitcase,

Very practical if you want to stay within the European quarter",positive
"Rooms on first floor are VERY noisy, the hotel outs advice a club and in the morning the awnings (that are right by the window) keep opening and closing",negative
"Parking was a little inconvenient as you need to leave keys with reception staff and they park the car in the car park. Not so easy for loading and unloading. 
The bathroom was not very clean and the shower sprayed water all over the floor. Limescale and mould on the shower head and tap and the sink was blocked with some kind of oil. When we told the staff about this we were told that we must have left the plug in and that’s why the water didn’t drain. The room and bathroom were nice enough that we could overlook this but it would not take very much for them to resolve the issue!,

The hotel is very nice and is in a great location. Our room was enormous. We were traveling with our baby and we were provided with a travel cot which was a nice unexpected surprise. Large bathroom with shower and bath.",positive
"The stairway up is small and dirty. And the apartment smelled of smoke,

Location",negative
"all was ok,

near metro.",positive
"The rooms were actually quite basic: ours reminded me of one of the better youth hostels I have stayed in. The carpet was a little stained, and I had to wash cleaning product residue out of the bath before I could use it. I realise that building works are currently being undertaken, and front of house does look splendid.,

The bed was comfortable and warm. Tea and coffee making facilities were good. We had a room with a view over the canal, which was absolutely lovely. The young man at reception was friendly and helpful, and directed us very well around the one way system in this ancient town towards the underground car park. The hotel was very central. Loved the Greek street-food place across the street. This was certainly the best food we had during our two-night stay.",positive
"We used it during the Houffalize trail weekend, it was an excellent property and we would use it again!",positive

"BEWARE! The pictures look ok, but it is a cheap and unfinished renovation. Arrived to a construction site: electrical cables hanging out of walls; antenna cables coming in and out of windows; dead lock in apartment 3 feel apart in our hands (thank goodness we had not yet locked it!); hot water not on in apartment 3; shower drain not connected properly in apartment 2. Safety and security is terrible. The door from the street to the building is broken therefore people from the street and nearby night club can enter the common stairwell (and do, at all hours of the night). The music and crowd from the night club close by makes sleep impossible. The sensor lights within the apartment come on and off all night without reason. It is non-smoking accommodation; however the smoke smells from the restaurant and apartment below enter via the bathroom pipes and permeate the apartments above (particularly apartment 2). People in our group woke up feeling ill from this - we had asthmatic children in our group - even the non-asthmatics were affected by the sickly odour. This was our worst Booking.com experience. We all decided it was not worth compromising safety, security and health staying the second night so we checked out first thing the next morning and found alternative accommodation. What a disgrace that this standard of accommodation is acceptable on booking.com.",negative
"There was nothing I didn't like.,

Everything was just as expected.  The rooms were fine. Although I like the bathroom to be separated from the bedroom.",positive

"It was perfect.,

This is an extension of our previous nights stay.  We had booked a total of three nights so this is the same review as our Friday night review....The reviews that we read before the trip were excellent and we found out why when we arrived.  The quality of the building, decor, food, accommodations, and owners was exceptional.  From the communications before the trip were friendly, detailed, and timely.  The interaction with the owners was extremely helpful at the beginning all the way to the end of our visit.  We wouldn’t change anything about our time at Art de Sejour!

"The hotel staff were extremely dirty. I went there with my family for xmas holiday. my daughter dropped her hairband on the toilet floor so I put it in the bin in toilet. when came back to my room after cleaner cleaned it, I saw she put the hair band next to the tap on the sink in bathroom so I put it back it the toilet bin and of course lots of dirty toilet roll after wiping ourselves was added inside the bin on top of the hairband. the day after when I came back I noticed the hairband is on my cloths in the room!!!!!! how dirty, untrained with no logic and incompetent can someone be??I worn disposable gloves and took the hair band to talk to a manager. Shocking. even though the so called manager heard me and obviously couldn't be bothered and even though she saw me wearing disposable gloves to hold the dirty hairband, she just took it from my hand and put it on her desk. so I mentioned to her that now her desk has contaminated but didn't look like she cared. Food was very bad. my partner got sick after eating the burger in the restaurant. I advice anyone reading this to avoid this hotel at any cost.",negative

"Hotel Bourgoensch Hof is in the centre of Bruges's Old Town and walking distance from the train station. The Belfry of Bruges and Markt is probably two minutes away only by walking. Rose Hat Quay or Rosenhoedkaai, the most photographed area of the city, is just at the back of the hotel! When it comes to location, this hotel is tops!Service is also very warm and sincere! The lady at the reception is helpful with whatever information you may need and gives out good advise. The room is the largest I've stayed in during this trip. The bathroom is spacious and the room's design is reminiscent of the 50s or 60s which definitely adds to its quaint charm.Hotel Bourgoensch will always be memorable for me since I saw snow start to fall while having my breakfast. Its my first time to see snow and seeing the grounds transform gradually to white is pretty amazing!",positive

The room was beautiful with a really big, comfortable bed.  The bathroom was spotless and had a really good selection of L'Occitan toiletries.  There was free sodas and water as well as tea and coffee plus chocolates and biscuits.  There was also plenty of space to store clothes and suitcases.The breakfast was excellent with fresh juice and really nice bread.Alvin welcomed us and was very helpful.

"Despite initially looking at this hotel for me trip, I went with the Radisson due to brand loyalty, however when informed of the renovation works I changed my booking to this hotel. Had to pay a 77 Euro upgrade because my room wasn't ready on arrival despite contacting them ahead. Got a Junior Suite which was spacious with a courtyard view, bedroom separate from bathroom and a mini hallway area,Although it was very disappointing that a second bed wasn't placed in a lounge area as we were staying with my son, we had to share the bedroom with him, and in my opinion and experience in a suite their should be two sleeping areas. I also thought the bed whilst quite comfortable were tiny, my wife and I shared a supposed double bed and we barely fit it.Also because staying with my son, it would have been nice to take advantage of room service, but the price was ludicrous, starting at 6 Euro for a espresso, so this was completely prohibitive, also be aware the hotel lists spa and fitness centre, whilst a basic gym is available the Spa actually doesnt belong to the hotel and you have to pay a 25 Euro surcharge per day to access it.,

Location seems ok, only a 10 minute Uber from the centre and 6-10 minute Uber from Brussels- Midi International.Very grand looking and gives the impression of a grand 5 star hotel.",negative

I am a little slow with this review as we stayed at Art de Sejour mid August.  I would highly recommend this bed and breakfast.  Very central to shops and tourist attractions in old part of Brussels.  Absolutely amazing! Mario was brillant from helpful welcome and tips where to eat, drink and best way to get to airport. Room so modern, clean and beautiful toiletries also very spacious.  Despite being on busier road very quiet.",positive
"We had a problem paying for our room, because the deposit is way too big. It was almost double the price of our room and it’s impossible to pay with a vpay card. The manager had to be called and we lost more than 1 hour negociating.,

The location was perfect it’s right in the middle of all the touristy things to do. Walkable distance to great shopping, site seeing, and tons of restaurants. Breakfast was great, standard but filling!",positive
"Could be a little bit cheaper and breakfast should be included in the price,

The staff were very friendly polite, and the room was clean without any unpleasant smell",positive

Fully renovated",negative

"Amazing, super-friendly host - Nothing is too much trouble.Excellent value for money.A fabulous hotel in the heart of Brussels - A stone's throw from the Grand Place & Manneken Pis.Would highly recommend this little gem!",positive
"Swimming pool is not from the hotel so we had to pay 25€ extra per person per day. Very arrogant and impolite staff at the spa desk, first thing they said was to complain at the hotel reception because they don’t belong to the hotel... 
They misguide people with swimming pool pictures on booking... small letters than say “extra charge” ! They should really change this and just say they don’t have a swimming pool or make better agreements with the operational company in charge of the spa... 
Very disappointing.  ,

Location is great!
Nice building!",negative
"Very expensive breakfast
All in all very good but they lose points in the details, eg:
Cleaning of the room was not adequate, they forgot to remove the used cups, to put shampoos, to clean the mirror
There was no toilet brush (pigalle)
We would like the water in the bath to be hotter 
No balcony ,

Very close to the city center
Spacious room",positive
"A bit of a maze, room rather cold, reception staff only ok ,

Reasonable value, very good breakfast, quiet",negative
Only stayed overnight. Ideal location if you are travelling for EU missions in the area.,negative

Location was fantastic. Close to market square and view from room was beautiful.",positive
"Great, friendly host, willing to show you the hotspots of Brussels, according to your interests. There's so much love in this place. Very tidy and comfortable room. Shower and batchroom facilities are perfect. Breakfast was nice too. Fresh bread and served by choice. A place to remember.",positive
"Stayed in room 204. Thermostat was not functioning room was almost a sauna. Facilities and finishes are starting to look dated and the hotel must be on the brink of losing the fifth star. Cheap toiletries, breakfast was average at best. The hotel staff do not greet. Bar staff was very poor and unwelcoming - need a little bit of serving training to improve the finesse.,

Hotel location was good. Building had a lot of character. Rooms were clean and luxurious.",negative
"Room was far too hot. Air conditioning did nothing, had to open the window fully and still wasn't cold. ,

Clean, large room. Good location",negative

No luggage storage ,

Clean, nice neighborhood, “relatively” close to city center",positive
"Amazing location... entire interior of the hotel has been redone so it's modern with nice big rooms, although the dining area still maintains the original interiors which I thought was lovely and rustic. The hotel is right on a canal so you have breakfast overlooking the water. Great reception staff and superb pizza restaurant across the road (and tons of other restaurants within walking distance).",positive
"The road is quite noisy, but this isn’t the fault of the hotel!,

Lovely friendly service, very stylishly decorated, very comfortable beds and lots of attention to detail. Very nice, tasty breakfast.",positive
"Not my first time there, but worst time . 
TV: all HD channels are not proper working, blocked or full with mosaic pictures 
Bathroom: who can’t clothe it proper.
Room door: the moment you have a draft it’s clapping
WC: Water flasher was not working proper
i did mentioned the tv matter 3times at the reception, but nothing better
i did called saturday late afternoon the reception 2times from the room.. no response 
my room: 606 avoid the 5th floor
i go back to Hilton Grande Place, it’s much better.. 
While I checked out, no commercial bargain or so proposed.. As I asked the lady for the price from the 11-13tge of décembre, Eur 260 per night so no being sorry we offer y a good price
Sorry to say,",positive
"Spacious room with comfortable bed and all amenities needed to make your stay pleasant, including Nespresso coffee machine. Excellent location, next to Grand Place and walking distance to main sights. Nice breakfast. Very helpful and accomodating service.",positive
"1. Huge lack of customer service experience: As I’m in business trip, I ordered a taxi at night to be ready next morning, next morning I asked for mu taxi and the lady said there is no taxi reservation when she checked the paper she found my order, and I had the most shocking reply “ my colleague wrote this mot me” and my taxi arrived 25 min late. Also I made a complaint and nothing happened not even “Sorry”.
2. Room service: Always something missing and I should ask for it.
3. Breakfast: I saw in the comments that there is good variety, which wasn’t comparing to the Hotel’s stars and prices.
This my 7th time in Brussels and my first time and last in this hotel.,

1. Location near everything walking distance.
2. Bed very comfy",negative

Location was perfect and staff were friendly",positive
The proprietor is very friendly and tries hard to make his guests welcome. He will make breakfast the way you want it. The building is tastefully furnished.  It is an easy walk to the Gran' Place and many the central station.,positive
"I had booked this hotel specifically for the swimming pool, for my 5 year old son. Upon arrival it appeared that it was for adults only. 
This was not mentioned on the Booking.com site, which the concierge acknowledged. I just got back that the hotel wasn’t managing the gym/swimming pool - well so don’t mention it as being part of your hotel amenities! 
At the bar i ordered a ‘tartelette’ which clearly had been in the fridge on a pre-decorated plate for at too long. No taste. After complaining, it was removed from the tab. 
Would not go back. There are better places in Brussels, less pretentious, with pool and great service. ,

Nice location, spacious rooms",negative
"Everything was perfect.,

The location is very good,  the room was very comfortable,  clean and the and lots of options on the coffee morning .",positive

Good breakfast, good staff.",negative
"They toke the money twice from my account and i had to call many times for them to fix it,

The appart was good snd spacious",positive
"Compared to the general good quality of the key comfort elements of a hotel room (bed, sheets, shower, towels) the towels were subpar.  They were worn out - overwashed, stiff and not very absorbent.  The other odd thing is that the door to the bathroom (toilet included) in our room was translucent glass - could have done without that.,

The location is fantastic - absolutely could not be better in Bruges!  Our room had windows on the canal - which would be even more appealing in warm weather, in December we still sat in them frequently and opened them a few times.  The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was filling and convenient and served in a room with another spectacular view over the canal.",positive
"We travel a lot and really we couldn't find anything... it was just amazing,

Mario , was the perfect host.  Our jobs are extremely stressful and we just totally relaxed in this special place .  The room was luxurious,  we were greeted every morning with an amazing breakfast where Mario even got to know our preferences. Everything about the surroundings  made you realise how much thought were put into the details- just check out that beautiful red door.  Breakfast started with a surprise smoothie every day! We were centrally located - to your  left - just a hop skip and a jump and your at the centre of the city and to your right just a few steps to the subway. What a perfect way to start our trip in Belgium.. ITS THE ONLY PLACE TO BE IN BRUSSELS.",positive
"Hotel conditions look very old. Must be renewed. WC in the bathroom does not work. ,

The location is perfect. Breakfast is rich.",negative

It’s near the center the staff was helpful very help ful , break fast was good",negative
"Bad noise isolation ... we were disturbed during the night by the neighbor (there is just a single door separating our apartment from the neighbor's one ...); two light were not working ... so it was difficult to work on the office (office light broken!) and not pleasant at all to eat on the bar table without any good light above us ... and to light on the bed, which made it impossible to read in bed before falling asleep ...!,

Very good location, easy check-in procedure",negative

The room was quite good, the location of the  hotel was also good.  So we quite enjoyed our time there.",positive

everything very good,positive
"the rooms and closets were not clean. Spiderwebs and dirt was common, and sereval details (door knobs, light bulbs) were not finished or hung up. The terrace was kind of dangerous because of rotten wood. Dogs and dogpoo in the direct envoiriment. The driveway has deep putholes which can damage a normal car.,

The views are beautiful. Complementary Nespresso and Bose bluetooth are nice. We also got a free babybed and chair for our toddler. The.price is also very friendly.",positive

Room was okay",negative
"Self Check-in quite challenging. No one physically present at the property to help at that time. Had to struggle on telephone outside in an unfriendly weather condition. Imagine if l didn't get the check-in directions by mail or lost them or had no credit to call immergency. ,

"Nothing!,

The property of the room!",positive
"Nothing negative per se, just beware that there is no lift in case you get a top floor room (3floors).,

None of those big hotels but house in residential area converted into a hotel. I chose it not only for that but mainly as it was in walking distance to the venue I had to be at during a work trip to Brussels. On the way towards Schuman, which can be reached in a few minutes' walk, there are a few supermarkets, shops and restaurants. There is a bus stop close by the hotel which includes possibilities to fetch a connection to the airport. I also liked the spacious room and that breakfast is brought to the room.",positive

Everything was top notch!,positive
"Looks like hotel is under staff specially when you arrive at night only 1 bellboy we waited long time for our car and baggages to be collected. Reception Staff are unfriendly, poor buffet for five star hotel. One time we asked for extra water bottles for our young kids they refused and suggested to use mini bar instead which I find it outrageous as none of our hotels we stayed refused such request in fact they were offering us without asking. ,

Location, hotel building, and specious suite rooms",negative
"The room was very small, there was no fridge, little bathroom supplies. At breakfast there were no vegetables.,

I liked the location, the staff.",negative
Location very central / near beach ( but not on prom; view is of main retail street). Breakfast excellent quality; fresh ingredients and all well presented.,positive
"This facility is barely a hotel, it is more a set of rooms without an elevator placed in a narrow building. The room had very poor hygiene, it smelled heavily of tobacco - ventilating for hours didn't help.  There were black hairs everywhere, from bed to bathroom. There is no common space in this facility, the breakfast is brought to the room. I paid in advance for breakfast, never received it.,

The location is good and room is spacious.",negative
"I would have liked to meet the host in order to receive some tips for the surrounding places. Some extra bedding sheets or towels should be available in the house (I got them just after calling). Especially in case of an emergency (my daughter made a set of sheets wet and we did not have a change). Some extra equipment in the house (for example kitchen paper or plastic wrap) might be useful. ,

The Chalet is very charming and cozy. The surrounding is wonderful. You can reach by car very beautiful natural places.",positive
"interior decoration minimum and outdated, not cosy. senseo machine not very clean - no coffee upon arrival (was refilled after calling)room was smelling a bit stuffy, should have been aired before arrivalfridge was not on and because of that smelling dampFor this price, breakfast should be included, and some water should be provided in the room.,

comfy beds, good shower and towels, spacious roomcommunication with staff",negative

You can't ventilate the room.Really low light in the roomAirconditioning is unstable - it can't keep the selected temperatureWater taps are in awful conditionThey provide a baby cot, but without blanket and pillow. I was proposed to use ones from the double bed or bring my own :),

It is in walking distance from the centerBreakfast is OK",negative
"Old furniture, carpet. Not value for paid money.,

Location",negative
"We were asked to check in before parking, as they will give you a ticket for the car park, however parking outside the hotel can be a bit difficult as limited spaces and narrow road. Not being given a full explanation of how to get into car park should the first barrier be down. Otherwise not much else to complain about.,

Excellent location, being close to the the Christmas markets and restaurants. Staff very helpful. Room perhaps a little basic but we had a great view over the canal and the bed was very comfortable. We didn't have the hotel's breakfast prefering to eat out, however, the €6 charge seems extremely reasonable, considering what we paid for coffee and a croissant elswhere! Parking close by, has to be reserved in advance, but at only €10 per day again very reasonable compared with other car parks. A heads up. If you arrive at the car park and the barrier at the top of the ramp is down, punch in the numbers on the ticket given to you by the hotel into the key pad. This will lift barrier to let you down ramp to 2nd barrier where you can insert the ticket and gain entry. We didn't work this out and spent several minutes sitting there, wondering if we had driven to the wrong car park. The barrier did lift eventually on it's on accord  and I can only assume someone in the office watching cctv took pity on us looking very perplexed and raised the barrier!",positive
"We felt excellent! The bed was comfortable, the room is sparkling clean, the host was very welcoming. I strongly recommend this place!",positive

"Uncomfortable beds, bedsheets with holes, tacky and badly kept interior. The continuous presence of the owner's dog on the terrace. Hardly any contact with the hosts. Initial booking of two friends, for which only one double bed was made. Eventual booking of one young man and his uncle, for which there was again only one bed made. A second set of sheets was only provided after putting in a lot of effort. The quality is nowhere near the price to pay for this accommodation.,

The terrace and the view were beautiful. Good hiking. Quiet wifi&tv-free environment.",negative
there was a lot of dirt in the room. the doors from the bathroom were not cleaned for weeks. it was loud from ventilation.,negative
"Needs to be refurbished , and a system for contacting in the weekends.,

Well located",positive
"Bright, flashing (every 15 seconds) LED ceiling smoke alarm unit; it was extremely bright in the dark bedroom and as it was over the bottom of the bed very disturbing.  Poor quality waterproof rubber cover to mattress which was uncomfortable (made me hot) also made a noise everytime we moved.  Rubbish pillows.  Corridor doors (Fire Doors?) constantly propped open for the convenience of builders working.,

Helpful, pleasant staff.  Location.  Two easy chairs and table by window to enjoy the view of the canal.",positive
"Mario and Ivan are exceptional hosts. They took great care of us during our 5-day stay in Brussels. When we arrived Ivan gave us maps and told us where to go based on our interests. Our bags arrived late and Mario received them for us and delivered them to our room. Every morning we had a wonderful breakfast with delicious food choices. Our spacious room was super comfortable with a great big bed, coffee machine, and food and drink items replenished everyday. We already miss Art de Sejour. ,

We liked it all",positive
"House keeping one night forgot to put toilet papers. Hotel will not provide extra drinking water if you need it. 4 times not refill tea coffees. There is a 7.5 € charge with any room service order, even if need a spoon or plate or can opener. Went for a meal in the main restaurant they said last order 11PM was there 10:44 but they refused to make any food. Only drinks. They block too much on your credit card for guarantee. ,

"The glass door to the en-suite was a bit funny and the breakfast was underwhelming.,

It was a lovely quiet and relaxed stay in a beautiful part of Bruges.",positive

"I found the bed too soft and therefore was really uncomfortable. I also thought the breakfast was too small for the money charged, the bathroom could have included conditioner (for hair washing) and nicer products, and the curtain didn't properly block out the light in the morning.,

The perfect getaway for a relaxed stay in a charming little village.,positive
"Room rents are very expensive, for business visit only and not advisable for personal visit. Very basic breakfast and not value for money, salad selection should be improved. Dirty floor carpet, single lift for all floors, very slow elevator. Bath room water tabs are too old, hard to handle, not suitable for aged people.,

The hotel location is just walk able distance from the Rogier metro station. Easy access to city attractions even by feet.

We really liked the hotel‘s location: close to the beach and next to shops and restaurants. The staff was really obliging and the hotel quiet although located in the city centre.

First, my room was right on the canal. I took a video out the window too share how great the view was. Also a minute or two walk to Markt, I can't imagine a better location. Nice size room with really high ceiling, classic looking ornately frame art on the walls.",positive
"The location was amazing and everything is on walking distance from the property.,

I liked the location and the facilities provided.",positive
"Not convenient to dragging suitcase to go such long and twisting hall way....to be fair, the room is pretty big, but I’m speechless on the view from the window.,

The hotel is on the One Way street. Don’t follow the direction of google map, otherwise you would never be there.",negative
"The furniture is situated very oddly . A 2 meter couch thrown into a corner by the window. MAke it flow a little better the space is poorly organized.,

Hotel is situated downtown. I wasn’t able to enjoy the area due to the rain . Receptionist was very nice.",positive
"Great room.  Great staff.  Friendly, responsive, eager to make guests happy.",positive

The customer service, from the front desk, to the house cleaning, to the restaurant was very pleasing. The rooms were also clean",positive

Very friendly staff who went out of their way to help you",positive
"Nothing to dislike!,

Very friendly staff who managed to secure a wonderful room for us. The breakfast was excellent and brought to us daily and everyone was very nice and helpful",positive
The pictures on booking.com did not relate to the hotel as I explained to the staff I felt it was false advertising. I changed from a different hotel to this one based on the photographs. I would recommend it to be removed from the site .,negative
"The apartment was quite noisy, located near a bar and right at the street side. Also heard some other people coming home at another apartment in the building quite late at night.
No private parking, but parking garage nearby.,

Nice location, room was good; didn’t use any of the kitchen equipment, but it seemed quite complete. The bed was also nice.",positive
Unable to take a hot shower...,negative
"Bad smell in the room, impossible to open the windows, also checked with the receptionist, no AC to get some fresh air during the night",negative
"We just loved staying here. From check-in to check-out, this hotel oozes class and comfort. The beds are perfect, the bathroom is everything you could wish for. It is a haven of tranquility - and should you need anything else, the staff is always ready to help.",positive
"central location lots of shops, restaurants close by, clean, friendly helpful staff",positive
"Location was great,

Staff were very friendly",positive
"The bathroom was a bit narrow and the toilet placed in the main room, separated by a door that would not close properly, which is of course due to the architecture and age of the old building - which is beautiful and totally charming (we were looking for this style of hotel) but worth to keep in mind. Covid obliged to have breakfast in our room and we took it in bed because only 1 chair was available in the room... again, no issue for us but could be an issue for other people,

The staff was very friendly and helpful and the building beautifully renovated. Very charming. The location was perfect to explore Bruges",positive
"During our stay room was not cleaned and water, coffee and milk not replenished. In addition to this upon return one night front door locked half hour before stated time and night manager refused to open even though I didn't have a key (only one issued for two of us and I returned alone). Night manager refused to come and open it was was miserable,

Good location",negative
"The location was perfect, everything on walking distance! The studio was clean",positive
"Toilet had no sink...  There was a separate bathroom though with a sink & shower.You had to leave the toilet in the hall area to go back through the room & into the bathroom to wash your hands.Just found that strange.  See the point to have separate toilet but put a sink in there while you are at it...,

Great location.  Staff very nice & helpful.  Only stayed one night but was pleasant.",negative
"plastic glasses in the bathroom should be replaced, in particular as a focus is put on environmental protection.",negative
My room was very dusty. All the shelves had dust on them like there was not cleaned for 2weeks or so.,positive
Clean good sized pool room with a view (room 333) breakfast was great with good variety.,positive
"There wasn't anything not to like.
,

Really good breakfast. We stayed in the apartment  which was a treat - privacy, relaxation of our choosing and hotel facilities.",positive
"Probably that at the time (Easter 2021) there were some works in the street. Obviously not the fault of the hotel, but it was the only inconvenient that I can find. Also, perhaps the lighting in the room could be improved as one of the little side lamps did not work, and they were not good enough for reading. But overall it is a great place.,

It was a family room. It was nicely organised at the top of the building (two beds on one side of the room for the children, and a double bed for the parents) so it was fun for the kids and comfortable for the adults. We particularly appreciated that there was a table and four chairs in the room, with cutlery and crockery, which made our stay very comfortable in this time of pandemics, when eating out is not possible.",positive
"A wonderful location,  parking is only a 5 min walk maximum.  Breakfast was amazing.",positive
"No response regrading my question about the carpark which was a pity as the carpark was expensive.  Having said that, the recommended carpark is very close to the studio, with good lighting and room to manœuvre the car.,

Great location in a quiet street close to the city centre.  Ideal for a short break.  I would recommend it to anyone.",positive
"Didn't feel like a 4 star hotel,

The location was brilliant",negative
"Indoor cycling trainer is located in the middle of the floor corridor in front of all the rooms which is weird. As for those who train but also for people living on that floor. Very dirty hotel entrance, the stairway was just covered with cigarette buts. The hotel is located in the same building as the shopping mall with lots of shady people running around at night. Liege is generally not the place you want to visit as a tourist. ,

Parking lot inside the building with a attractive parking  fee for hotel guests although can only be paid cash. Nice restaurant across the street.  Generally the standard IBIS.",positive
"The room service. I called to order cocktails to be told that I’d had to wait 40 min because the bar was full.. I went down to the bar, it wasn’t full and the barman told me that the person I had on the line said nonsense. I had my drinks in 10 min. The next morning we ordered breakfast in the room, when I said an English breakfast (and explained what was in it), the person wrote down English breakfast tea (I felt the need to recheck everything), asked for sautéed potatoes and received fried beignets of potatoes??, asked for 1 x eggs benedict and received 2 (but they were delicious), they had no fresh pressed juice at all and the sausages were just uneatable. ,

We booked a junior suite. The room was impeccably clean, smelled fresh and was huge! The Egyptian sheets, the mattress, the marble bathroom with huge bath were pure luxury. The staff was very helpful, friendly and really willing to help with a smile. The reception and inner courtyard are grand!",positive
"All good,

Great location, helpful staff, good facilities, great breakfast",positive
"Went for 2 nights with partner in mid June 2019.
Very clean and comfortable rooms. Always have a friendly welcome from Anne.
Went half-board for the first time- evening meals were very well prepared and served.
Breakfast is always well done too.
Will definitely return there again  maybe later on in the year to catch the better weather.",positive
loved the location and room and very friendly staff.,positive
Very close to Market Square. Clean and comfortable. Reception were very helpful,positive
"This studio was well situated right front of and next to parking places, as a semi-basement studio we were a bit cautious not to open the windows and curtains during the stay. The studio was well equipped at kitchen with a big fridge and a comfortable double bed. It was totally reasonable to stay here!",positive
"I have never experienced paying deposit in any hotel. They asked to guaratuee with 20euros beyond you pay the whole amountright after arrival. For not so cheap hotel in the centre it is guite embarrasing. Room is big but with old wooden furniture. Bathroom is fine but average, not so clean.",negative
"Super loud noise on the flushing of the toilet. Bathroom super small. ,

Great location. Right in the city. Car park garage in the building. Car park pretty narrow and tight. Room Super small but ok. Ok for one night stay.",positive

"Location is great, staff are lovely but the bar and restaurant are boring and lacking character or atmosphere!",positive
"A classic hotel with a modern touch inside the rooms centrally located in de Panne. Very friendly welcome, very comfy beds and small but enjoyable and clean bathroom are the main points I really enjoyed. WiFi is for free and working fine, parking is public and right in front of the door... The room wasn't big but quiet and enough for one night.",positive
"Breakfast was fantastic, the staff were super helpful and location was perfect! Just wish we could have seen more of the Inn. Next time!",positive
"Everything was a little sparse. By the kettle there was only one small bottle of water between us, 2 teabags and 2 coffee sachets, no milk. Very limited space for clothes for 2 people, no information about Bruges in the room and even the pieces of soap were tiny. We'd paid extra for a standard room rather than a budget room and yet it was fairly small and I'd thought would have a river view rather than a noisy road view.,

The location was excellent. The view from the breakfast table. The bed was very comfortable.",negative
"Could use a couple of tea towels. ,

The location was superb and the owner was fantastic. She set up AC without being asked to cope with the heat.",positive
"The hotel has disappointed us. Once we entered our room, we noticed that the floor in the shower is full of water, because it was dripping from a few spots around lights (!) on the ceiling. We asked for another room, the hotel staff wasn’t even surprised. We realised that it must be something common for them, because in the new room the ceiling also had old traces of water. Everything in the rooms, furniture, towels, looks old, there was no fridge. The breakfast was also disappointing: the choice was very poor, the quality of food is not perfect either. Probably a few years ago this hotel indeed deserved its 4 stars, but not anymore. Only its location makes the hotel attractive, but for the rest it requires significant changes.",negative
"Typical Ibis. Check in easy, staff pleasant and capable, room comfortable with a good view. Breakfast is usual Ibis affair i.e. better than a youth hostel but not by a long margin.",positive
"The service in the bar is not at the same high level as in the rest of the hotel.,

Excellent hotel, excellent service, nice situation. Staff is friendly, professional and well trained.",positive
"I cannot complain about the hotel but I felt unsafe in the around of hotel. Brussels is not a very safe city. I arrived after midnight and the receptionist was afraid to open the door and was a little concerned. My wife was angry at the person but I cannot blame the person because it is not their fault. City is not that safe. I recommend to all tourists be careful when go to Brussels and be alert after 11pm.,

Who wants a good hotel in Brussels go to this hotel. it is perfect to rest few days. Good service, cleaning and breakfast. I have not had chance to visit the leisure center but should be nice.",positive

"Ana on reception was so nice and welcoming and was a pleasure to deal with from our time of arrival to our departure. Our room 701 was a lovely size and the bed and pillows were so very comfortable.  We requested a quiet room as were concerned about traffic noise as I am a light sleeper, our room was well located and there was no noise to be heard.",positive
"To have a rug mat in the bathroom .,

“Lovely location with convenient street parking.  Excellent Breakfast . Staff very friendly ” English speaking was a bonus.We will strongly recommend .We will be staying there again.”",positive
"Only minor things, like that there was a motion-sensor light installed at the entrance to the room so it came on if we got up in the night (like, to use the bathroom).  There was a door between the bedroom and this entry area where the motion-sensor light was, so it was not the end of the world.  We would have LOVED it if the room had had a better table for enjoying the wonderful breakfast.  We only had the desk and its one chair, which kind of brought our breakfast enjoyment down a bit (the pandemic rules require that guests eat only in their rooms).  The room was very comfortable, there were hooks in the bathroom and the tilework was all nice and clean, so no real complaints.,

Great small hotel in a suite of very old buildings.  Unique, wonderful architecture, winding hallways and staircases that led to our gigantic family room with a view over a courtyard to fascinating rooflines and a tower!  The hotel was just off the Grand Market, so it had a great location.  There was a city parking garage nearby, which worked for us since we drove.  The staff was absolutely WONDERFUL, very welcoming and accommodating.  The beds and bedding were wonderful, the bathroom was modern and very comfortable.  The breakfast provided was wonderful.  We loved it and will absolutely stay here again.",positive
Clean and new furniture I guess,positive
"Nothing.,

The location of the Place 2 stay was fantastic. This place is really close to the old town. Also, the room was clean, and all the items were in stock. We stayed for a day, but it's a good place to stay longer if we had more time. And the host who named as Nele is really friendly. The next time I visit Ghent, I want to stay it again.

The room was spacious, very clean & bed extremely comfortable. As it was my partners birthday the hotel staff put balloons & party hats in the room, gave us a free drink each & wrote a lovely card with birthday wishes. Breakfast was amazing!!! Food was fresh & great choice.",positive
"Lack of free parking,

The room was magnificent and spotless, the food was great and the staff were fantastic.",positive
"There weren't really negative points, maybe just a visual embarrassment brought by the works around the hotel, they were killing a bit the charm of the surroundings but that is something you cannot avoid :-),

The hotel was a great choice for a city trip to Bruges, located in a charming old building few minutes walking from the main market square. The ladies running the place were very kind and helpful and we had a very good breakfast, even if it was served in the room due to the pandemic... The room we had was clean and large with comfortable beds. We also used the private parking few steps away from the hotel but that was not a problem. We definitely recommend this place and we will not hesitate coming back at some point :-)",positive
"There were too many levels in some of the rooms, with step ups and downs, and there was a lack of light switches near the beds, in my instance you had to get out of bed to turn off the light above the bed, the door into the bathroom didn't quite open fully, and was a little bit difficult to shut properly.,

The location of the hotel was good, only a few minutes walk from the market square and all the other amenities. The staff were friendly and the hotel was clean throughout.",negative
"The studio could've been cleaner. Especially the floor was kinda dirty, and a lot of crums in the couch. The kitchen en bathroom however were clean.,

First of all, the location was top notch. Moreover, the bathroom etc. were nice and the studio was had plenty of space, all for a decent price.",positive

"The bed was not up to the standard of the rest of the room and the hotel which were excellent. It felt more like a cheaper , fold out bed with not much depth or comfort- sorry!.,

Breakfast was one of the best I have had in Brussels , having been here on many business trips. The location near the Metro was good also. The leisure facilities were very clean and modern.",positive

The facility was overall very good and in a convenient location.  The breakfast was very good and we loved the coffee.  The pool was an added bonus after a long day of walking the city streets.

All professional fotos of the hotel at booking site have nothing in common with the real appearance.After a complaint we have received another rooms, however, it was still very poor in quality.  I did not dare to use the shower.After this first impression we did not take breakfast at all. All in one bad experience.",negative

Fresh orangejuice, croissants, cereal, fruit, ... Would stay here again. It was my girlfriend's birthday and the owner arranged for flowers at breakfast.",positive

A vey nice one room apartment. Very modern and with all the comfort. We had a great stay :),positive
"The fact that one of the rooms was infested with bugs is not a good sign (they were in the fabric panels at the head of the bed). We also looked under the sheets and mattress and even though there wasn't any bugs, it was stained and had lots of stray hair. Staircases also unmaintained and some are plain blocked with construction debris, making fire escape hazardous.,

It's not far (about 15 minutes) from Noord and Central stations, and about 10 minutes walk from city centre. Large hotel with a lot of facilities, including gym and several meeting rooms. Room wasn't very large but was fairly comfy - until we discovered bugs there though. We were moved to a larger room and given a free breakfast though - breakfast was fairly good, although not exceptional, I'd recommend to go out instead, would be same price or cheaper too. Staff was friendly, helpful and understanding.",negative

"We had Room 321 and the bath/ shower Set up was in a low roof space area, so bath it had to be. It was however a small price to pay for the view out the window.,

The view was magical on the canal, both day and night. It felt very relaxing and soothing. The hotel room was warm and comfortable with a soft bed. The location of the hotel itself was perfect in the old town centre.",positive
"Property was amazing but a lot of narrow steps to the room. We knew this already so wasn’t an issue for us but could be for others.,

The host Nele was there for our arrival and communicated with us when the room was ready, she advised us clearly of the parking situation and went above and beyond and took us to the nearest parking spots! We stayed in the top apartment and it is beautiful, there is even an amazing terrace which would be fab on summer evenings. Very spacious and had everything we needed.",positive
"The covers and pillows were not great. The cover very stiff. The bathroom sink area seemed quite disgusting due to tear and wear on the marble. Looked incredibly dirty. Room was somewhat basic while trying to give the appearance of quality. ,

Right in front of the hotel is the canal cruises. 2 min walk . 
Just a little warning though there are pick pockets apparently in January in particular. These scum are professional and can get into zipper bags etc watch your belongings .

"Bathroom was down on lower floor - but house design made good use of the space available,

Beautifully clean and well presented, more spacious, light and comfortable than the pictures might suggest. Location perfect for anything in the town and beyond. Charming host full of advice, generous with extras and readily available. Kitchen area though tiny is well-designed, likewise the bedroom off the main room. Wifi strong, heating easy to use. Off-street car parking. And the weather was perfect!",positive
Our room was right under the roof but in between other houses that’s why it was very quite around and still we had nice views of roofs of buildings nearby :),positive

Yes i will tell to my friends 🙂",positive
"Two Items for Improvement1.) The cabins are set on ""Pet Friendly"". This is taken to mean by the guests that the pets are welcome in the accommodation. We were not sure the host understood this. He stated that pets should sleep in the car. The temperature was -1 C out so that was not an option. If they are uncomfortable with pets or are unhappy with the state of the cabins after a pet stay they should change this setting to indicate ""No Pets"". 2.) The owner wants 100Euro deposit (IN CASH) on arrival. This is understandable and we had no problem. However they owner should say this very clearly in the advertisement up front. Now it is buried in the ""policies"" which many do not read. Many people are not in the habit of traveling with that much cash these days and they might be cut short. We only knew because we asked about the check in procedures and he mentioned it in passing. Otherwise we would not have known.,

The farm is quiet and peaceful set outside of town. The cabins are new, very clean and very comfortable. I would recommend that they are ideal for no more than two persons especially during bad weather.  The host was very friendly and check in was quick and easy. The breakfast was very nice and taken in our cabin. All was provided beforehand in the refrigerator and cupboard. Many of the ingredients were home made and were very very nice. They were also for sale.",positive
"Acces stair too tiny. A fan in the apart.(heat).",positive
"Heavy use of conditioner on a bed linens - not all people like strong smells in the bed before sleep. Pillow was too dense and high for my taste - would be great to have a selection as in the room there are extra pillows anyway. A blanket is to warm for me, but I have this issue almost everywhere - growing up behind a polar circuit doesn't help me in this case. Bed cover is that half-synthetic thing with a rubber around mattress, doesn't breath really well, but people there are very used to them, so you'll see them a lot. Room is right under the roof and it could be quite hot inside on a sunny days and small windows won't allow to move this hot air out fast. Overall it all may look small to you and you won't even notice, I believe I've just spoiled myself sleeping on fresh chill air in all-natural bedroom at home, that is why I was too shy to tell Els and Tom all that personally.,

Exceptional breakfast, nice owners, perfect location to work in Bornem. Fast WiFi (~20 Mbps) by local standards, although signal strength could be improved. Basically you stay in a quiet beautiful place with a fresh air and nice accessibility by car, and Tom and Els will do their best to make your stay perfect.",positive

"I was traveling solo. My room was at the end of endless corridors, where was staff entrance/stairs. Scary for solo lady traveller. On top of that my hot/cold water regulator was broken! After 5min in shower water got so hot that I couldn’t stand. And the knob was broken so no way to turn down. They send a plumber, but just imagine.... a women with wet hair, and red eyes from shampoo, in the end of dark corridor waiting for someone to come. No bath robe. Small towels to wrap up. Terrible.,

Location of hotel is very good. Easy to find.",negative
Rooms are very spacious,positive
"The waiting time in the reception for our chack in was more tha 30minutes. There was no fridge in the room and no AC. There was only a small vendilator that did not work. Overall not a good experience. Would not visit again even though we have stayed in many hotels from Ibis.,

The location was great.",negative
"The price of breakfast was too high for the options and the quantity which they offer.  Moreover there was not enough shampoo and body gel for a shower.  ,

The stuff was super friendly,  eager to help every time with a polite and friendly way.",positive
"Breakfast was too expensive and would have been nice to be included in the hotel price.  Everything else was great.,

I loved the location.  Close to a pedestrian walkway and major sites  and close to the metro.  I liked the view from my room.  The swimming pool and sauna was a nice bonus to have after a day of touring.  Very modern style was also excellent.",positive

Only the location",negative
"No mirror in the room, just in the bathroom, where it's difficult for my wife to use her hair drier.Overly complicated controls on the heating - couldn't adjust the temperature at all.Strangely, the toilet seat is set too high, ever sat on a toilet with your legs dangling? It's really uncomfortable.Breakfast food was fine, standard continental with good bread, but the breakfast room used to be a bar area, and the staff will insist on doing the washing up behind the 'bar', right next to the customers which is really noisy.  The coffee is terrible, stewed and weak.  You've got to read the label on the vacuum flask to check it's coffee as you can't tell from the flavour.,

The location is fantastic. All the staff we spoke with were friendly and helpful",negative
"We got the first apartment in the ground floor which is a semibasement apartment and this was a little bit strange as we are not used to it. 
Also, there is a sliding door at the bathroom, but we noticed this is common for properties in Belgium.,

The room was comfortable and clean. The location was great, right in the city centre and at walking distance of the main attractions. We stayed only for one night in Ghent.",positive
"Room, breakfast,

The room was like a prison cell with a small window looking at the front wall in 2 meters and still they call it deluxe room and charge for 180 euros a night. The breakfast was very basic, most hostels have similar or better, cold coffee and tea and still u have to ask for it. Don't waste your money by staying at this hotel",negative

Rooms are clean big and comfortable. Great internet speed. Great beds.",positive
"The stairs up to the room could be dangerous for some guests. The apartment didn't feel overly clean and was tired looking, the photos on booking.com are very cleverly taken and quite misleading. The bathroom with the water tank and used as a storage room was not nice and the smell of the drains was off putting. No window in a tiny box room bedroom felt claustrophobic but can't be helped. The curtains in the living room need changing! The lights on the outside of the pub are on all night right above our window, the curtains didn't keep out any light at all, we woke at 1am thinking it was morning!We asked for a fan on a very hot night to be laughed at by the lady behind the bar and told that she could do with one too... Overall the place feels a bit shabby and could do with a thorough clean and some new towels etc.,

The apartment was fully equipped with a kitchenette and everything need for cooking etc. Sheets and towels were supplied, also wifi and big screen tv.",negative
"The proporty owner is really great, Vivanne was waiting for us to check in and accepted early check in and also late check out.
She also took us in around the house and gave us welcome gift also explained the tourist attractions in the region.

"Location ,

Great location,  looks  good from outside. Reception area very modern , rooms no character,  cheap pine staircase, tatty lift and the corridors to the rooms dreadful. The building is old but they have added no character to this hotel.  The only place that’s in keeping is the restaurant which looks over the canal. Should of been cheaper to stay. But location great if that’s all you want.",negative

Very spacious, airy and clean. Great Central location close to all amenities",positive
"Although only a short walk from metro, grand place etc i didn't feel like it was in a safe area, we were two females alone and felt unsafe early evening etc   there is a coffee machine but you only get two pods per day, there is a kettle but no tea bags,milk etc    also the restaurant was closed on a Thurs for a public holiday but we were not advised of this and had planned to eat there due to not wanting to go out in the evening,  I have stayed in other hotels who have notified us of any closures if it is going to effect our stay.  We were not expecting a public holiday on a Thurs . The breakfast wasn't the greatest,  we were not asked if we wanted tea or coffee the first day and chose to have breakfast out after that,

Very clean room, large room",negative

I enjoyed.",positive
"When we called the hotel to ask about where to park, we was put through to the main call centre who told us to park in St Denis.  When we walked to the hotel and checked in we was then made aware the parking garage was directly beneath the hotel with a direct access lift.  This information could be updated to the call centre.,

Plenty of eateries to choose from.",positive

Hotel staff",negative
"Wish the room was the size for one person properly - I was traveling alone and did not see the point of staying in the room with 2 extra beds, as the room was very cold. ,

Compared to other hotels around, it was relatively inexpensive though I made the booking last minute. It was also close to the subway station.",negative
"I have not taken the breakfast option, but the location was just perfect and the room was comfortable and clean",positive
"Based practically next door to a pretty canal walk, this hotel is ideally placed for the city centre. The walk to the market Square takes about 15 minutes with small children, less by yourself even after a few glasses of Bruges Zot! The hotel itself has recently been renovated, the beds are comfy and the showers are hot. Breakfast was continental style with a limited choice but okay for the price and the guy who works seemingly non stop on reception is very helpful and friendly.",positive
"location it is perfect in the city centre.the room very clean.",positive
"the entrance staircase !,

very central for exploration of liège",positive
"The bed was hard and the shower was dirty but if you are planning to stay there for a night and if you won’t take showers then that’s not a problem. The parking is    only for around 4 cars so you probably won’t be able to park. You’ll easily find a parking spot on the street. ,

The rooms are big and the check in went well. The rooms have a bathroom and a small kitchen. You can have wifi in the rooms.",negative

Really central, lots of things to do and see. Loads of restaurants close at hand",positive

The room was comfortable and the hotel is quite near historic Brugges.",positive

breakfast too simple. very poor internet,negative
"The big problem with this hotel is their centrally controlled air con system, which did not seem to be working well enough, and the windows in our room were hermetically sealed. We were sweltering in this breathless room and couldn't sleep - I had to call reception at about midnight who swiftly moved us to a room where the windows opened. I'd never normally complain like this but it was like being suffocated. Big relief and a much better night's sleep (although the new bathroom smelled slightly of smoke!). The hotel is nice, clean, spacious, well located and people are friendly, but the temperature control was a total deal breaker. 
There was also no apology at any stage, or explanation. Reception check in was also slow as they only had one person on the desk.",negative
"The bathroom needs a little improvement since the shower and the tiles looks old but its not that bad.. need a little more cleaning on the vents...,

The hotel Manager was very helpful and accomodating. The room was smaller than expected but it was comfortable and rooms were cleaned everyday, beddings and towels are replaced everyday. We booked the triple room 15... The room was a bit on the old side but beds are soft and comfortable. The location was also very nice, about 10 mins walk from Bruge City center and you can reach every attractions by foot.. Overall our stay was very nice and price was the most cheapest which is a steal given that we book on a peak season...",positive
"Parking space somewhat remote, about 300 m walk to the parking garage,

It was really downtown, most of the things within walking distance",positive
It was an excellent place to stay considering price. Good connection if you want to visit Brussels and other cities like Antwerpen.,positive
excessively hot room. no air-conditioning. no ventilation. windows locked. a basic fan was provided with the room.,negative

"The air con in the room wasnt great. Needed the windows open all day and night, but that's pretty normal for anywhere in Europe really. It wasn't a big issue at all.,

Everything. The location, the beautiful renovations they have done, the incredibly friendly and welcoming staff, and did I mention the location???",positive
"The decoration took a bit too much space away from a necessary working area and storage space for documents and small items.,

The attention to detail to create a NY loft atmosphere was great. We also liked the small backyard, but it could have been designed a bit more.",positive
"Poor breakfast, hardly no greens,, staff not service minded, s tains on the carpet in the room, no air condition in the room.,

The location",negative
"A little redesigning and this could be a nice old-fashioned styled hotel and they could even ask a bit more money for the rooms :-),

We had a family room with two extra beds so there was enough space. The hotel is a bit old and the design is old fashioned but it good enough for at least one night. The bathroom was quite small but the shower was good.No real extra's in the room but that was expected. Breakfast and location are good.",negative

"Breakfast could do with more choice although what was in offer was lovely. Reception doesn't open until 8:30 am so caused difficulties checking out early.,

Staff we fabulous. View from bar terrace amazing. Centre of the city. I would highly recommend this hotel. My room was very comfortable with a lovely view and the shower was how I like it. Plenty of hot water.",positive
"Noise from the neighbors, it's pretty easy to hear the television, coughing or other noises if your space is quiet.,

The cute charm of the NY theme, the home like amenities offered, plenty of tea and coffee and Martine even brought us more creamer packets, small garden outside to enjoy a cup of coffee or wine, cozy atmosphere, available netflix for cold evenings to stay in, quick replies from the hosts and easy to connect!",positive

relatively close to town center. quiet",positive
"Nothing was spot on!,

Good location, clean, value for money",positive
"Breakfast was not at all as per expectations. Only Breads, Croissants, Butter & Cheese with Tea-Coffee. No options & Variety. No Fruits at all. Though we are pure Vegetarians, as an observation - No Eggs, Omlette, Meat for other Guests. Will never suggest anyone to take this 'With Breakfast' if one can have other options. Kitchen did not contain Crockery, Had to get it from staff. Its just like Hotel room forcefully converted into Apartment with small Kitchentte. Wi-Fi very poor. Frequent disconnections. Very High rates for such facilities. Small restaurant. In morning hours, it becomes too crowded when all the Guests reach for Breakfast.,

Staff at reception & restaurant was Very helpful & courteous. Location is 4-5 Kms from City Centre. Near to Atomium. Easily accessible towards Brugge (95 Kms from Brussels). Private Parking available, but only if Hotel is not full. Could not be guaranteed.",negative
"Lovely people, friendly and helpful. Property is quirky and cosy but stylish. Spacious room with excellent bathroom. Good breakfast. Excellent location. Would definitely come again.",positive

Friendly Peter, owner. Very helpful, thanks.",positive
"Our room was half in basement, which made it a bit grey and uninviting room. The rooms upstairs are much nicer. finding parking space was relatively difficult with all those road adjustments. We have parked in Dok Noord, which is ca. 15 minutes walk (we have avoided staying in the parking of the Friday market because we expected a lot of hassle with the real market on Friday),

Modern neutral/clean design. Good bed. Kitchen well equipped.",positive

The breakfast was good.",positive
"The hotel is great, in a perfect location, lovely family run hotel.
My only thing to add , is that it has a very steep winding staircase, I don’t think the hotel has an elevator, anyone elderly, it could be a problem.",positive
"The room was a bit smelly and under-maintained. The lighting in room was very poor.  The staff were quite unmotivated, water in the shower was yellowish.,

I liked the location of the hotel and the breakfast was nice.",positive

The house has an unique design and feel. I really enjoyed staying there. It has all the facilities we needed and is located in a really nice area",positive

"Building under construction! Very noisy from 7 am onwards. Sledgehammerfest!!! No remedy was offered (free breakfast, rate discount etc.) Room very small and cramped.,

Covenient parking",negative
The owner came to pick me up late at night  from the train station because there was a strike of trams without extra charge!!!,positive
"Few negatives. It is truly too bad that the window sound insulation was not properly taken care of when refurbishing/restauring the appartments. Unfortunately street noise can be well heard. Cars passing (although traffic is limited) and poeple speaking in the street especially late partying people on weekends etc.. Truly, this would be the best investment in the facility to make it like 10/10. Some additional towel hangers and shelf in the bathroom would be handy.Provide some cleaning items (sponge or brush) to wash and clean after a dinner or breakfast.,

The location is in a rather quieter area with limited traffic. Parking (paying) available on the adjacent square or street parking; public underground parking in the nearby large square (Vrijdagsmarkt) or with the owner's private garage in the same public underground parking (upon request). The city can be explored on foot easily from the location.The appartments are clearly new and with a modern minimalist decoration. Kitchen is sufficient and large enough with a medium size fridge. Appartment holds a coffee machine and a boiler. Tea and coffee & sugar available. Some appartments maybe larger or smaller as they are not exactly identical but still roomy enough for a long stay. Ours (#101) had a reduced but still sufficient bathroom. The appartment on the corner of the building (#103) is larger and very pleasant. The host, Nele, is efficient and pleasant and available for help (for instance to kept our luggage after checking out).",positive

"Bathroom with an overall strange smell, indescriptible but present. Of course a few minutes after closing the door you don't smell it anymore because you're used to it, but it's there. ,

Unbeatable location, 10 minute walk to the Grand Place in downtown Brussels. Coffee machine included un room. Very spacious room enough to have 2 to 3 suitcases opened. Near supermarkets and  grocery stores selling good food if you don't want to pay for the extra breakfast In the hotel.",positive
"The Grand is a fantastic place to stay. Absolute value for money, fantastic well designed house, pure architecture. Also Greet is a very warm and welcoming person. The location in the center of Antwerp is superb. Would go there again any time.",positive
"Streets, of course, are tight and tough to drop off luggage for folks that cannot walk from the parking garage.  Not a big concern, but get all the information on parking at the reservation time.,

The upgrades to the facility were excellent.  The staff was extremely helpful in every regard.",positive
"curtain was broken & couldn't be openend,

The location was great. It's just behind the square with bars and shops and just 5 mins walk to get a tram to the train station. It is 2 mins walk to the river which there are a few bridges to walk over and lots of lovely bars to sit outside in the sun eat and drink in. Nele was Lovely and very informative. Will definitely be staying here again",positive
"Close to the city centre, very nice and helpfull staff!",positive
"Weekdays breakfast only offered till 9:30am. Finished too early for tourists. They need an automated fresh juice machine, takes too long time to manually squeeze oj in the morning especially when it closes early as 9:30.,

Room is spacious. Inter leading rooms are convenient for our kids. There is a big daybed in the room which is nice. There are extra bedding in the cupboards.",positive
"The bed was very comfortable but the room was very dated. My window was held together with cello tape and it rained heavily which came in through the window sill. I wouldn't recommend for price. ,

The bathroom was very nice, shower was lovely plus it was clean. The kitchen in the room was very useful but we had no kettle.",negative

"No room service on Sundays,

Staff is super friendly and helpful, the design is great, location is perfect, rooms are super comfy",positive
"There is nothing that we managed to think off that we wanted different or better in the accommodation.The immediate area around the place is nice and calm. You are in a student area so the odd music or singing is just part of the package. But the wider area to the north is still being developed and Antwerp as a city is going through a major makeover so many key streets and boulevards are closed off for roadworks. It makes traffic a bit of a challenge.,

The atmosphere and lay-out of the house is fantastic. It also offers some original surprises that just makes you smile and like the place even better. The details like sauna oils and the little chocolate waiting for the guests were just the icing on the cake. Also the optional access to a parking space is worth a lot in Antwerp!",positive
"Interior room furnishing could use a bit of a refresh... but it was fine.,

The view of the canal... amazing!",positive
"Nothing serious. Sometimes the wifi signal went a little bad.
Unfortunately the matress was not the best fit for me. But that's actually something I cannot blame on the host.,

The location was perfect for our needs. The studio very well decorated in a way that everything made sense,  and comes equiped with more things than you would expect. Very welcoming and comfortable!
We're just sorry we could only stay for one night.",positive

Huge and very comfortable bed!",positive

I was not being picky but it was very distracting, hard to sleep but my main complaint is that no solution was offered.  Secondly when I took the sheet off the bed, the mattress protector was covered in dark hair (it was not mine).,

I liked the location, it was great, so central.  A quick walk and you are right in the centre.",negative

Good location (close to shopping street and public transport), warm and clean",negative
"The thought on booking accommodation online, was the breakfast was more than continental but nevertheless still a pleasant stay. The other thing that didn't come up on details was no lifts to the second floor, my wife was pregnant at the time of the stay and with our son sharing our room was tiring.,

Location of hotel to main centre, not too far to walk and the staff were very accomodating",positive
"I requested far in advance a nice view, I didn't' get it. Room in the past was probably in better conditions, on my stay June 2019 it was a little beat up, and the bed rickety.,

"The room was pretty dirty. The staff claims to be trilingual but does not speak Dutch. Not recommended for if you want to stay several nights or are on a holiday. Poor breakfast.,

"Private parking was advertised and not available (one of the main reasons I selected this property). Also checkout wasn't easy. First I was told that I could only pay cash (which I find weird for a property on booking.com), then the person who was going to collect the cash missed her bus(!!) and then all of a sudden it was possible to pay with credit card... a little shady in my view.,

Location is great, appartment was very clean. Easy access to Vrijdagmarkt and other highlights in the city center. Access is easy via intercom system.",negative
"Top floir so very hot. And parking can be an issue. But to be fair probably same everywhere in brugge,

Fairly close ro main town on foot. Guy in reception very helpful and good english",positive
"No issue with service. Only problem was neighbouring room playing loud music and due to location loud outside at times which is to be expected being so close to central attractions and bars.,

Excellent location, facilities lovely and staff very friendly. The bar and resturant was excellent. Our room was big and spacious with added extras. Option to use the swimming pool and fitness centre too.",positive

Smiling and friendly staff. Hearty breakfast. Comfortable beds. Location.",positive
"It is noisy, you hear neighbors next door, on the corridor, everywhere. Hotel is fine for 1 night or a couple of nights. While works outside the front of the hotel are finished and some of the rooms have been revamped, I still feel they have packed more rooms than need making walls very thin and corridors very narrow. Hotel main staircase seems to be under works for a long time, not very safe. Some room's main window does not open.,

Good value for money in the city centre. Close to restaurants and other parts of the city, walking distance. Metro stop nearby. Room are large, clean and bed comfortable.",positive

Great location and friendly staff. The breakfast was good specially the fresh cooked eggs.",positive
"The breakfast was a bit disorganised, they were removing it 15min before the closing time for breakfast. They did not replenish the bread, hot water, etc. during the scheduled breakfast time. ,

The location is great for visiting the center of Brussels as everything is at walking distance.
The isolation of the room It's very good and you cannot notice the traffic from the road or the noise from the street.",positive

Stayed here before, good location in La Panne. Staff are very helpful. Great value.",positive
"I had requested a room on the first floor and promised this room, as i didn't want a room on lower ground floor as it is next to street level and where cars are parked and was to be given one of these rooms.  Communication was not so great from the host. I paid by bank transfer and had to e-mail several times to get confirmation of payment received.,

The location was fantastic.",negative

Everyone was very friendly and the building was nice snd authentic, with high ceilings, spacious room and a cute balcony♥️",positive
"Nothing to dislike.,

Had canal view room. Bed was huge and comfortable. Over bath shower in bathroom.  Room had fab view with windows opening right onto canal. Old building full of character and also been modernised. 
Breakfast usual continental, plenty of choice. Plumbing in bathroom gurgled a bit and was a slight smell which went away but to be expected.  Certainly didn't detract and would highly recommend. 
2 mins walk to market square and right next to beerwall. Overall would stay here again",positive
"Unfortunately because of the utilities companies laying new pipes and cables in all of the surrounding streets vehicle access to the area around the hotel is almost impossible.,

"Breakfast! Ot rather lack of it! On Sunday 25/11 there was an annual cycling event (De Panne endurance beach race) and there were a few cyclists staying at the hotel. All we asked for was plenty of coffee, cereals, milk and some fruit at 06.30. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen. There was a lady preparing breakfast but she was so slow and so miserable that we didn’t have breakfast in the end.,

Very friendly staff! We had problems with getting to the hotel due to one way roads and road works but the reception staff came out to navigate us. We were also allowed to have a shower in our rooms after the beach race (De Panne endurance mtb beach race) which was much appreciated.",positive
"We didn't expect to be staying in a room below street level with a view to car tyres. The design of the bathroom inappropriate, narrow, sliding door, no  privacy. Bed on the small side. Well equipped kitchen. I should be made clearer that accommodation doesn't accept credit cards. Parking possible but not easy. Disappointing value for money.",negative

"Hotel a bit dated. Shower cubicles extremely small. No tea making facilities in rooms although we had free access to kitchen at night for making tea/coffee.,

The owner went out of his way to look after us. We were there for Armistice celebrations and he gave us 2 books on War Graves in Flanders. Came out onto main road to guide us to the hotel when we got lost. Good breakfast selection and plenty of.",positive
"Great location to discover this legendary city!
Big, clean and comfortable!",positive
"The stairs were small and we ended up using a spiral stairway to carry our bags up, which was a little difficult.The bathroom didn't seem to have any ventilation.There was a little side street near our balcony where you'd have people stopping to chat out loud and sometimes school children, you could also hear cars with the windows open. Not a huge deal though.,

The breakfast was simple but good. They have this sort of underground, cave-like area which works as a second breakfast room, pretty amazing!It's very close to the old town center. Quite a few things to see at walking distance from the hotel.The hotel itself was in this quirky old building, which was pretty interesting.",positive
Very friendly staff. Lots to eat at breakfast. Very close to city centre.,positive
"At the time of our stay the hotel was going under some refurbs , although the room was in good condition the value for money was perhaps a little to high,

The hotel was very modern , the room was clean and the bed itself was very comfortable",negative
Great hotel,positive
"The bathroom door. It's a sliding door that doesn't shut properly. I was there with a friend and well, it's impossible to have total privacy with that sort of bathroom. Otherwise everything was good.,

Friendly staff, the room had everything you needed and is really not too far from the city centre!",positive
"I couldn't find anything wrong with The Boterhuis and we will probably stay again.,

The Breakfast was very good and nicely presented.The location is excellent,5 minutes from The Belltower.I wouldn't think the hotel is suitable for anybody with any mobility problems as we had some very steep stairsto get to our room.They probably have some ground floor rooms though.",positive

We spent 2 nights here .nele was lovely and really helpful .we arrived a bit early but she accommodated us straight away !! The apartment was so spacious and very well equipped.

"Major problem was heating. Brussels is cold in January. The room's only heating source was air conditioning. All attempts to regulate it manually from the room failed. We had to call the reception often so they regulate it remotely. And the night receptionist did not like this, which he communicated in a rude manner.Another issue: Internet connection had sporadic interruptions.,

Excellent location (next door to the main shopping street Rue Neuve, 10 min walk from the main square, etc.). Modern facilities, clean areas and rooms. Good breakfast.",positive

Great location 5-10min walk from the centre. It’s a small hotel and it feels very relaxed. The staff were really helpful and when we arrived to drop our bags off at 10am, the room was already clean and they let us check-in straight away. This was lovely as after travelling overnight by boat, it was great to have a shower before exploring.
The breakfast was simple but more than you need. Nice breads and cereals with the usual meat, cheese and egg accompaniments. It was also nice to eat in the conservatory which in the summer I imagine it lovely.
Comfy bed, hot and and powerful shower too. All for a great price.",positive
"Room was a bit small but bed was very comfortable and the blinds completely shut out the light.,

Reception staff are very friendly",positive
Location couldn’t be better. Breakfast included was good. Staff were super helpful.,positive
"NIGHTMARE. We went with a friend who had a single room. Unfortunately when he went to bed some itching started. He looked closer and found many small insects on the sheet in the bed. No one at the reception at 23h. Our friend couldn't sleep the whole night. When we complained the next day, the owner was extremly nasty, unfriendly and he ignored fully what had happened...",negative

It apartment had everything we needed and the hosts were great. It exceeded expectations.,positive
Clear instructions,positive
"It was a bit outdated otherwise it would have been perfect for my family and I. I didn't like that they moved me from rooms last minute and I had to share my bed with my toddler since the room didn't have a sofa bed like the one I booked for. The room they gave me was the first floor which I liked very much since I travel with 2 kids and they are noisy but they gave me a 3-bed room instead of 4 or a queen with a sofa bed that was what I booked.,

The place was great for what I paid for but I dont think I would return because it was very outdated. I think it needs a bit of better decoration and a more updated bathroom. It felt old is not a good way. I would stay again if was the only option because is closed to EVERYTHING and the staff was sooo nice and friendly. The breakfast was included and was delicious and fresh too.",negative
"Good breakfast.
Staff at the reception was extremely nice and efficient.",positive

Parking! They have free parking !!! Kitchen in the number - really good surprise =) Good breakfast.",positive
"This hotel really lived up to all its great reviews. The staff were pleasant, cheerful and helpful. Our room was large and tastefully decorated. I had asked for a bath, if possible, and this was provided (huge bath!!) It was also quiet. It was possible to regulate the heating. The inclusive breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice - including fresh fruit, cereal, and eggs freshly cooked as one wanted. There was also a kettle in the room. Only ordinary tea and instant coffee provided so if you want something a bit different take a few tea bags or whatever. The location could not have been better - a few minutes stroll to the main square. We walked to and from the station but there is a frequent bus service. All in a a great place to stay.",positive
"The apartment is absolutely enormous, host was extremely helpful and communicative.",positive
Very well equipped. Very nice host!,positive
"It's a Great position, but unfortunately the only thing that's good , the recommendation for owner to refresh the apartment and invest in the cleaning lady. Another illogical, is that it has a box for keys and self check in is possible up to 14 hours,

Great location&view,available parking spot.",negative
"Missed breakfast second morning and charged us 2 euro for coffee,

Nothing miles from town cost us a fortune in taxi fares",negative
"My room hadn't been made over on the penultimate day.  Cleaning staff had changed my notice on the outside door from ""Please clean my room"" to ""Please do not disturb."",

Proximity to main sights. Courteous staff. Reasonable rates.",positive
"Nothing but positive words for this stay. The hotel is perfectly situated in walking distance of  all attractions. We had two new rooms at the streetside, with excellent isolation. If you are by car the parking ""Pandreitje"" is again in walking distance and almost a bargain at 8. 5 per day.
I will definitely come back",positive
"First of all, - ATTENTION, there are road and sidewalks reparations all around the hotel quarter, no way to find a way to get the hotel. We had to park at about 100 m from the hotel and ask how and where to park a car (there is private parking at 20 m from the hotel (12 euros/day).
Even if it was not a problem to walk 100 meters more, I always prefer to have more honest information as possible.
So first thing first. The information about 70 meters from the seaside is wrong, - you have to walk at least 100 m to Niewportlann, then about 100 m to the seaside, which makes the total distance of about 200 m.
The second point is about the state of the hotel rooms and facilities. You have an impression that nothing was really done at all to keep it in a good state, just some small reparations scamped here and there to hide some defects.
There is no door in the bathroom, just a plastic folding screen with a handle that you have to change (inside, outside) to be able to close/open the so-called ""door"". The shower has just a half-covering screen, so when you take a shower, you have 50% of water drops outside the shower, just on the floor. The bathroom size is just 1.5 sq.m, so for people of more than 1.75m, there is not much place to turn without hurting vs something.
OK, it is a 2-stars hotel, you might say, but.. no, listen there are some limits, IMHO.
As for the isolation, forget about it, you hear steps, coughs, all that produce any sounds ) you hear it. More of that, as there are works to remake sidewalks and roads, you are woken up with the rumble and noise of all the working vehicles starting from 7am! It stops at 5 pm.
The third point about breakfast. I don't know from which planet come people saying that it was exceptional. As for the variety of products, it was just an absolutely normal thing, you will find almost the same (if not better) in no matter which low-cost European hotel. So why were people so excited about it?,

200 m from the seaside. We arrived at 12.40 and we could get our 2 rooms ready to put our luggage even if the check-in was starting from 2pm.",negative
"The entrance door of the apartment could be better sound-proof,

Perfect location right in the heart of Ghent!",positive
"Payed twice for the booking.
Barely could understand each other.",negative
"Not a self caterers apartment. There was a shortage of plates and cooking equipment. There was a coffee filter but no filter papers. There was 2 frying pans and one were large pot. There was only 4 very large soup bowls, no meat plates and no side plates. A toaster, washing up liquid and dish towel to wash and dry the very large soup bowls would have been nice.,

Very attractive period mansion",negative
"I was waiting nearly 2 hours for my room...,

Central location",positive
"The receptionist wouldn't let me pay in cash, eventhough I had the option paying in cash or use my credit card. I tried to explain but he remained stabborn and doesn't want to listen. Breakfast was almost non existent! Cold tea and coffee, no eggs, no ham, no meat product at all, no tea spoon. Shower sprinkler too short (ca. 1,70m), some bulbs were broken, the drain in the bathroom were blocked, both the sink and the shower drainage, no soap, no light in the underground parking, the stove didn't work, no utensiles in the kitchen cabinate ... I wonder how it's possible to award a hotel with two stars when all the above things and more are missing!,

Location is not bad. Parking availability. The room is big enough. Internet connection was good.",negative
Great location and  a comfortable room. Easy walk to everything. Breakfast was small but good. Would definitely stay here again.,positive
"Quirky and lovely flat. Suprisingly big and comfortable. 
Owner was lovely and responded quickly to our late check in request.
Would recommend!",positive
"The only notice is that there is no door between living room and bedroom. So if you are traveling with friends keep in mind that there is not private place to sleep in it, in bedroom from the bed you can see the sofa in living room. There is only one door inside and it is the door in the bathroom. But this door is made of opaque glass and unexpectedly it doesn't go right to the ceiling that's why you can hear any noise from the bathroom and toilet.,

The guesthouse is situated on the second floor of the owner's house with separate entrance. The apartment itself is very clear, pretty spacious for 3 people (living room with kitchen in it, bedroom and a bathroom) and has everything to spend nice week-end close to Gent. We spent 2 nights here and felt like we were at home. It looks like on the photos, there are anything you need from microwave to washmashine and drying mashine (by the way, Miele). There is tea and cofee and you can prepare cofee in coffee maker and use dishwasher. If it is cold in the street there is a heater. There is also private parking just in front of the door. It takes only 15 to drive to the center of Gent and 40 minutes to drive to the center of Brugge. The hosts are very nice people, the communication was easy and very friendly. The owner speaks many languages, it was a pleasure to speak with him in English, German, French. His wife also speaks Russian. We arrived at evening and could enter in the apartment without waiting for long check-in. The ownes came later to welcome us by themselves and to explain us everything. At check-out time we could just close the door by ourselves and it wasn't nessessary to wait somebody.",positive

I never recommend  anyone to the hotel  because is a hotel  for Pakistan family residential and not a hotel. Very noises during the night Also they don't respect clients",negative
Everything,positive
"No plugs in the bathroom and was warm in the room without the window open, but had to close it because it was to noisy outside.",positive
"The kettle in the room was wired wrongly and not earthed (they replaced it when I complained). No ironing board was available. The breakfast was pretty minimal, with not even a choice of fruit tea, only tea or coffee. The TV was OK but the reception was a little fuzzy.,

The staff were very helpful at every point. The bed was very comfortable. It was possible to bring my own breakfast to the breakfast room and use the microwave there. The croissants at breakfast were fresh and delicious. The location is handy for VUB Jette.",positive

Everything",positive
"Just what I expected for the price.,

The location was good, near to the train station, nice neighborhood, close to downtown and restaurants. The hotel gives you what you need for the price you are paying, a clean bed and bathroom, is not luxurious, just a place to spend the night in a safe and clean environment. I traveled with my family, including kids, and it was good for our purposes.",negative

i like how the hotel is located in between central and nord station, so that it's like 10 min walking distance from either the station. The room feels spacious too. overall not too bad.. i would recommend this to my friends",positive

The room was spotless clean, we didn't really have any natural light in the room. Our friends had a room with a view which was lovely. Our room was very good value and we were put all day. I would chose a room with a view if I was back in Bruges. The location couldn't be better.",positive

"Just to be honest. The flat is located on the second floor of the abandoned house on the territory of the huge storage facility near the road.  The flat looks cosy on the photos, but , in reality, it is not. Old, not very comfortable bed with linen that needs to be ironed. Old grey towels. Dirty windows, nails left in the walls, lots of different boxes and staff in the cupboards. It looks very untidy. In addition, glass door to bathroom leaves you no privacy. There were dirty towels left in washing machine and tumble dryer was still working when we arrived.  Some man was fixing roof on the storage building till the late evening and it felt strange.  Not recommended, especially for families with small children.,

"That's a thing I don't care for, but if you look for a brand-new building with new walls, new facilities, then this is not the place. But everything works well so for me, it doesn't mind how old is the paint or the shower. I was well there.,

Placed in the very opposite side of the place where I had to meet (but good communicated), the Hotel is in a quiet, nice place. People working there are very kind. Facilities are good for the price: clean and comfortable.",positive
Second floor apartment was comfortable and clean. On site property owner was very helpful and courteous. Good access to roads and public transportation.,positive
"The basin tap indices were the wrong way around. The hot tap had a blue one and the cold had a red one. That was the only issue and as long as you remembered that there was no problem.,

Everything was excellent from the the check-in, the room, breakfast, etc. It totally met our expectations. The location really suited us. The owner was very attentive to make sure that everything was good. The staff were very efficient.",positive
"We had a room overlooking some kind of space between buildings, some other windows facing our window within very short distance so we kept the curtains closed almost the whole time. Also - not much daylight coming in. Only 2 Nespresso capsules available per day for free. ,

If you go to bruges you must stay in this property . The owners are fantastic its like being in your own home with out having to lift a finger. Lovely hotel lovely staff and 100 yards from a beautiful city square . My wifes disability need were well catered for . Breakfast in bed each morning. Lovely groundfloor room with easy access for wheelchair etc. Cant wait to go back",positive
"Some of the photo's of the hotel were in my opinion misleading...the front of the hotel was modern and our room was a ""white cube' the window was ""blocked' with a un openable blind...as it looked onto a wall...very claustrophobic not to see outside...obviously a new part of the hotel.  No wardrobe just a rail with 4 hangers but they gave more when requested.,

Rooms were clean and bathroom large with bath and shower. Breakfast was in the old part of the hotel and the view overlooking canal was lovely..(which is what we were hoping for when we booked the room! ) location was brilliant for all attractions.",positive
"The pool is small and warm. Still, we enjoyed it. There was a mass of construction in front of the hotel, but it's not like the hotel staff can do anything about that. And it's easy to get around the work.,

The service was excellent and the building was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was well-rounded, with many choices available. This hotel caters to both families and folks on business, and it does both quite well.",positive

Efficient service, clean rooms, modern touch to an ancient building and great location for centre of Bruges",positive
"Nothing I can think of.,

Very nice and modern hotel.   Its located in St. Catherine neighbourhood which is less crowed with tourist.  There are many restaurants and bars within 3 min of walk from the hotel.  The St. Catherine neighbourhood is very lively and in reality not a long walk from Grand Place.",positive
"Localization is medium. Not a lot of shops/restaurants nearby. Relatively close to expo. Lack of air condition, which hurts during hot days (we had a fan in out room though). Kitchens items were old/dirty. Breakfast was mediocre. Coffe/tea/juice, milk, some toasts and cheese. No meat, no anything hot except for coffee. ,

Personel was nice, 24 reception, wifi worked well. Our room was cleaned everyday, which we didn't expect, so it's a big bonus. Breakfast place was open 24h (without breakfast itself obv, but there was a nice big space with tables and chairs where we could spend our time with friends from other rooms). Fridge in the room, kitchen in the room. Shower was great, with really hot water (if preferred) and great water pressure. In general I would recommend this place.",positive
"The breakfast coffee machine was on a timer and didn't start until 8:30. The reception closed at 5pm and so any out of hours needs were not fulfillable. Bring your own soap as they have those slivers in packets. No on-site bar. Minor quibbles. A nice place.,

Breakfast was quite adequate and enjoyable. Shower was good and beds very comfy (in fact, one of the more comfortable beds I've slept in a hotel in a while). Curtains were of the blackout type, which is very good. The television was handy. The view out of the window was pleasant. Parking was nearby and easy to reach. The area was quiet and near a park, and about a five minute walk to the centre.",positive
"Pity that due to Covid, the bar at reception and sauna were closed. But this is understandable.,

We have been staying at Dolce La Hulpe on a regular basis. Great hotel in a beautiful area. Large free parking space.",positive

So no real mod cons but the building is old an beautiful with great views so makes up for lack of facilities it has two interesting neighbours on one side a sex shop on the other a torture museum so caused much amusement ,

Old and interesting",positive
"Only thing was that the swimming pool was small and that could have been clearer on the website.,

Bedroom was great and location was fantastic.",positive
"The room was not ventilated for ages: smell of the room was awful! The bed was really very uncomfortable: 2 mattress each on other and moving to all sides, windows opening handle -broken. The furniture of bathroom was broken (MISSING DOORS), many rusts on the walls.  It is needed to take medicine control to take a look if You did not catch diseases from this hotel (nail fungus or etc)!!!! It was really very POOR hotel and the price do not match such type of room. Shame on hotel staff, who can not speak english.I am strongly disapointed with this one booking. IT IS THE WORST HOTEL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE!!!!",negative

"Showers were not clean when I was there and there is a system to limit water consumption, so you need to push button every 30 seconds to continue water flow.,

Everything was great! Good idea to have a bar right in a hostel. Quiet sleeping space. The only one thing is design of rooms is very ascetic. Very close to sightseeings.",positive

"Nothing !,

Lovely property 2 minute walk from historic central square .  Breakfast was generous and served in a charming courtyard.  Staff was so helpful and friendly , gave us excellent dinner suggestions , one of which was an excellent foodie-gastro pub and bar right next door.  The room was modern with a stunning bathroom and immaculate .  The location couldn’t be better.  I’d stay here again without question next time I’m in Bruges.",positive
"The bath was a health and safety hazard when showering as there was no non-slip capability in the form of either a rubber mat or rough surface.  We found it to quite dangerous.
Also, the basin in the bathroom could not be use  for anything other than cleaning our teeth since it had no plug to keep the water in for washing or shaving.
Furthermore, there was no toaster at breakfast so toast was not an option.,

It was clean and tidy and comfortable and the staff were very pleasant and friendly.",positive

Breakfast was poor. All self service and crammed into small space.,positive
"The ONLY place in front of the hotel to drop off luggage and persons was permanently taken during our stay.,This hotel needs a doorman! So if you come by car with a lot of luggage it is a bit tricky!,

Excellent room",positive
Bathroom old and not so clean,negative
"Not as advertised: on the webpage the rooms look pristine, the reality doesn’t match. The ceiling showed clear signs of past leakages, as well as the quaint wallpapers, which had a yellowish tinge. Some of the light switches were missing their covers. There was no soap in the restroom, discovered only after the fact. Worst of all, the shower was full of mould, which is a tangible health hazard. On a side note: included breakfast was a selling point to me, on site we were told it wasn‘t included.
After voicing our complaints the management granted us a discount to be fair, but the room was still too expensive for the quality provided.,

Close to the city center, easily accessible, very good mattresses, friendly and hospitable personnel.",negative
"No conditioner, shower cap or body lotion (strange for a 4* property)
Breakfast could have better quality products (ex: croissants, bread and cheese were quite low quality, industrial type),

Nice to have breakfast set up served in room",positive

location was short walk from centre",negative
"The hotel is quite old, it seems. The pool and the rooms could all use some renovating. We also didn't like the carpet in our room. For a hotel in the middle of the woods, where your boots will unavoidably get dirty, this is far from ideal. The beds were also subpar, especially the small pillows and the sofa bed if you get a room for 4 guests. The food in the restaurant is good, but comes in small portions and is just too expensive for what you get.,

Great location, in the middle of the woods. Depending on which room you get, you can have a beautiful view on the surrounding forrest. Good food from the restaurant.",negative
"A bit of a walk from the train station but there are buses near by. I didn’t mind the walk but it’s on the far side of Bruges ,

Very modern, safe, clean and quiet. Private showers. Adjustable heating.",positive

"The common areas can get very noisy in the evening, that's great if you want to listen to live music and get a drink but it makes working or reading completely impossible. ,

- check-in and check-out were very quick and you can leave your luggage in lockers for free after checkout
- the common areas are big, there're also a kitchen and garden available for use
- the rooms are very spacious and the beds quite comfortable, the lockers are in the room but conveniently separated by a door so that you don't wake your roommates up if you need to open your locker late at night or early in the morning
- the bathrooms were very clean
- the breakfast is simple but it's great that it's  included in the price of the room. There were 4 kinds of bread available, as well as peanut butter, jams, marmalade, chocolate spread, fruit, yogurt, cereals, coffee, milk and juice",positive

"The elevator is small.,

The cheap and tasty breakfast!",positive
"Breakfast was a bit on the expensive side considering the options given although there was a nice selection of food available. I don't know if children had a discount for breakfast but if it was the same it'd be harsh.,

It was close to the Grand Place and public transportations. There was quite a few supermarket close by as well.Room was clean and hotel's staff was really friendly.",positive

"There was some miscommunication, but probably due to the corona time we are still in.  The second morning we would have expected our breakfast to be delivered same moment as first day, but nothing happened. Eventually they told us that everyday we had to order it at the reception. Nobody informed us of this.,

The environment is beautifull in the middle of woods. Great place for walking.",positive

"Covid Time room service menu is ... drab. But that’s excusable, and we simply ordered sushi from outside which was lovely. ,

This is a covid time review, so not representative of the usual service, I guess. But overall the stay was lovely, the room was comfortable, the staff were friendly, and the swimming pool was very nice. Can’t wait to go back when things are returned to some normality to enjoy the restaurant and all other things that were closed because of covid.",positive

Quirky, a good breakfast, much character, excellent location for access to the town",positive
"The breakfast could be improved. It was understaffed, so when an item, e.g. coffee, was exhausted, it was replentished with a delay. The breakfast room, however, was by the canal with nice view.,

We stayed in a room with view to the canal. The view was spectacular. The (standard) room was spacious and the location just perfect a few meters from the market square.",positive
Pool and spa,positive
"We weren't expecting to get any toiletries etc. at a youth hostel, of course, but they didn't even have paper towels in the restrooms. More importantly, in the morning, when we asked the staff if we could leave our luggage at the hostel until the check-in time and use the restroom very quickly (as we just had arrived at Brugge that morning after a long trip), one of the staff kindly allowed us in but the other member started a loud argument with him in Dutch (which made us extremely uncomfortable) and basically kicked us out before we could use the restroom. This has nothing to do with the service we paid for (after all, we were there before the check-in time, before the reception was open). However, it kind of ruined our experience at the place before our stay even began.,

It was a lovely facility, located at the very centre of Brugge. The rooms were clean; the lounge and the kitchen (although the oven was broken) were easily available. The internet connection worked without any problems. The breakfast buffet did not have many options but was sufficient.",positive
"Everything was great, we just had some difficulty in navigating the spiral staircase to our 2nd floor room as we had heavy luggage. We managed fine. ,

Great location, really big family room, really good breakfast, pleasant and very helpful staff",positive
"bathroom is dated.. heating needs constant adjustment,

recently renovated but original charater kept",positive
"Restaurant rather expensive and not the best quality.,

A modern hotel and wellness complex situated in the heart of the forest. Very comfortable room and large bed. Ate lunch at the restaurant and found the quality below what we expected and the price above what we expected. We did not eat breakfast there as it also seemed to be rather expensive. We were able to use two e-bikes and discover more of the forest for free, which was a big bonus. We decided not to use the swimming pool due to current health risks but it looks great. We will definitely stay there again on our next visit to Brussels.",positive
"No towel! (Only for rent) It would be better if providing towel or at lease have something in the bathroom to clean the floor after having a bath. There are many people use the bathroom and after some times it looks like a flood!,

Cheap price! There is a nice bar at night inside.",positive

"Having little kids we really missed a playground or a playroom at the property, it’s certainly has enough space to have one..also the position of a TV in the room wasn’t great but we didn’t come to watch it anyway),

We enjoyed the restaurant in the hotel, and loved the forest walks around the property. A bit unusual to book the pool but this is due to anti Covid measures. Staff was nice and friendly.. the room was tidy and had all we needed incl. forest view.",positive

The WiFi was superb, the facilities were amazing!! Very nice staff and a beautiful location with lots of really fun hiking trails around the village!",positive

Beautiful hotel in the centre of Bruges. Spacious, comfortable family room, which was very tastefully decorated. Fantastic, helpful staff. Generous breakfast. Can't wait to return!",positive
"They are in the process of renovating the hotel and rooms.  Unfortunately we were in a room in need or renovation.  I booked a room with a canal view for my birthday and was disappointed with the price versus the quality of the room.  Our shower didn’t work terribly well and when i tried to use the hotel hairdryer it caused a power cut!,

It is in a fantastic location.  There is also a really reasonable priced car park nearby as well.",positive
"Huge terrace, perfect location, luxury bathroom... these are just a few things we liked - this penthouse is superb!",positive
"These are just very small remarks (nothing too big!): There was a bit of a weird smell in the flat, but maybe that's because of a special cleaning due to covid? The flat in general was a bit dark, but this is not the owners fault (the windows are simply not very big). Apart from this all good :),

The village was a dream! We really loved it and can highly recommend it. Possibility to do a couple of walks around the village, which is very nice. The appartment where we stayed was great as well and the owners were super friendly. It's a charming farm where we stayed. The flat had everything you need.",positive

"Only one of the two restaurants was open and due to the coronavirus, the breakfast was simplified.,

I booked for my mother in law and my wife due to the heat wave, the air conditioning was perfect and my wife used the pool and walked in the nearby forest. The modernist 1972 architecture was very well respected and would be worth preserving for the future.",positive

Lovely hotel with personal service in delightful location. Only negative: the hours of the lunch service (12-14.00). Everything else just perfect.,positive
"The location was brilliant central to everything , Spacious rooms with a toilet separated from the shower room for extra cleanliness. You can see the swimming pool from the lobby which was really cool. All staff were lovely the place has a really nice vibe.",positive
"We got to change our room since it was full of mosquitos when we arrived (quite understandable considering the location). We got a lower standard room which was good, and a small discount at check-out. Not a big issue. All food machines where off and some furnitures in our room would need to be refurbished. No bikes for teen-agers (only adults and children size). Would like a bit more control in the wellness area/pool, since we spotted some guests not respecting Covid-19 protocols sometimes.,

Very good structure in the middle of Forêt de Soignes and close to the Solvay Castle. The perfect starting point for bike rides and trekking. We appreciated the several free services (including bike renting) and the kindness of all staff members. The wellness area and pool are good and clean, although quite undersized considering how big the hotel is, but they limited to 30ppl per hour (under Covid-19 restrictions, don't know about it in normal circumstances). Good breakfast with limited but quality choice. Check-out until 18h00 is a real plus!",positive
"Providing a map would be nice,

Cleanliness and price /quality",positive
"The room we had looks out on a street that remained lively until the early morning hours.Narrow spiral staircase can be a challenge for people with impaired mobility, but there are rooms on the ground floor - be sure to ask for one if you need it.,

Great location. Friendly helpful staff. Good choice for breakfast. Good bar. Comfortable room.,positive
"Breakfast was added at check-out even though it was part of the booking. We had to go back to reception to get this corrected.Rooms felt a little outdated with wall to wall carpet (we prefer wooden floors).,

Free bike rentals were really nice. Rooms were nice and cosy, but could do with a refresh. Breakfast was limited due to COVID. The area is really nice for outdoor activities.",positive

Rooms, bathrooms, the bar",positive
"Dark windy stairs at night. ,

Great location, great breakfast, great ac!!!!",positive
Fantastic canal view room (extra cost!) but the location in Bruges is fantastic and very central.  Parking is at an underground car park and is very cheap and just a few minutes walk from the hotel.  The breakfast was okay.,positive
"No soap for washing hands, the water in the shower doesn’t get warmer than just lukewarm.It was difficult to find a nice place to have a good breakfast in the town of Marche-en-Famenne.,

Spacious, apartment with brand new appliances and furniture! Comfortable bed! There are cleaning products and vacuum cleaner, in case you are not satisfied with the level of cleanness.",positive

Great location",positive
"Breakfast was included in my reservation (add. 23 EUR), however this was only for 1 type of ham/cheese, cereals and coffee/drinks. The only extra option available is English breakfast for which you have to pay extra. It's very strange to see such a poor breakfast in such a high class hotel.,

Great location, beautiful surroundings, MANY activities for free, swimming pool, sauna, spa - everything is beyond expectations!",positive
"Confusion at reception about parking. ,

Room, staff breakfast. Great location.",positive

Beautiful panaromic view from the balcony of our room. Cozy and comfortable. Highly recommended.,positive
"Nothing ,

I thought it was great hotel. Lovely rooms",positive
"Expensive breakfast (23,- a person/day) and food in the restaurants. Also a non-alcoholic cocktail for 9,- euro I found a bit too much. 
Spa was fully booked for all of the 3 days of our stay, I guess if you want a treatment you need to book ik weeks in advance. ,

Great location, spacious rooms with stunning views. Huge hotel but it feels very private and small in the woods. Great breakfast!",positive
"Lot’s of flies everywhere, probably because of the farms in the neighborhood. You have to be aware of opening the windows in summer.,

Great area, very quite everywhere. Sheeps walking up the hill. It’s a nice touch. Great as a stay for other trips to Namur, Dinant, Durbuy.",positive

we found the breakfast cold,positive
Hospitality,positive
Evrething was perfect !!!,positive
"breakfast buffet is very crammed; too little space for too many people. this resulted into an experience of foodstall (as opposed to a restaurant)quality of pillows is very bad - if there is a single thing that needs changing, pillows would come top of the list.no blanket in the cupboard (and fairly thin duvet),

quality of the welcome and availability of staffvery helpful staff at the gourmet restaurant: we were late and the staff accepted to serve us in the restaurant rather than restrict us to the room service",positive
"It was a bit noisy the last night, no one's fault just very thin walls.,

The location is great, beautiful little village, and cows on your doorstep. easy to get to Dinant, and very close to Furfooz which was a great walk. The little apartment was lovely and very well taken care of.",positive

One of best hostels I’ve ever been.,positive

Very clean, close to the center and metro location,",positive
"Nothing to dislike.,

Really unforgettable stay. The place is a hotel and art museum at the same time. Fantastic breakfast and hospitality, Highly recommended!",positive
"There was nothing not to like!! It is in the middle of a farm, which I loved, but others might dislike?,

Fabulous location, beautiful property, great welcome, close to all village amenities. Superb coffee!! Great Bakers, even open on a Sunday morning. Friendly village and community, so much to see and do even just in the village. I would love to come and stay for longer another time.",positive

Great and friendly atmosphere.Cozy rooms.",positive

"It’s a farm house, there are cows in front of house!! It was a pity we didn’t bring our kids this journey, they would be really excited to be there!!!",positive
"I did not like the system for electricity. Every time one of us from the room had to go out to the bathroom or downstairs, we had to take our card out from the power switch and someone had to replace it by another card, so the power in the room did not cut off.,

I liked how tidy, clean and comfortable the hostel is. Location is very good. Staff very helpful and friendly. I liked the way they let you keep your luggage in the lockers for free in advance of check in or after check out. Highly recommended!",positive
"- Amazing and kind host- Delicious and extensive breakfast- Comfy beds and very silent room",positive
"Very nice room, big bathroom. Very friendly staff, familiar atmosphere. Delicious breakfast.",positive
"It is noticeable that the hotel needs a renovation. Location is amazing but it needs better organisation and definitely small renovation. If you do not do it as soon as possible, you will loose costumers. Also the breakfast is 23 euro, this is ridiculous!  It wood be much better if the swimming pool is a bit bigger, it gets really crowded.,

This is my second time in this hotel. The two reasons that brought me again are the woods and the swimming pool. This time, the air conditioning was also one of the most important things for me, since it was incredibly hot.",positive
"Beautiful view from our room, very friendly host. Everything was perfect!",positive
"nothing,

great staff friendly",positive
"Coup de coeur in Louise area, run by a generous host with good eye for detail. Very comfortable room/en-suite in wonderfully renovated building. Breakfast was nice too.",positive
"Only a small thing- some cleaning materials were missing (tablets for the dishwasher, scrubber),

Location is great, close to the attractions that were in  our Ardennes trip  . 2 minutes walk from a great boulangère/pâtisserie.
Very well equipped kitchen, including  a dishwasher.",positive
"Just that the common toilets and showers are at the end of the corridor and it could be annoying if you want to use the toilet in the middle of the night.  Also, the door access system in the room is weird. If someone goes out early and pulls their card out, the entire room is in darkness. I understand power saving, but wish there was  better way.,

Very helpful staff
 Helped me on several occasions during my stay. Great property and happening bar.lovely kitchen.  Spacious rooms with great lockers and a fabulous location. Will definitely come back and recommend. Oh, the location is unbeatable.",positive
"Lovely service, excellent breakfast",positive
"Breakfast was good, but can be better as we built more expectations",positive
"The only two challenges I see with this hotel are: a) the facilities and services are stretched when it is very busy (such as busy pool and busy breakfast restaurant) which can be avoided by going at off peak times and b) the restaurant still struggles to provide good food and good service (especially slow); I now prefer to take the car and visit a restaurant in La Hulpe or Genval for example.,

Great location in the forest (ideal to disconnect from the city although so conveniently close). Walks in the forest at different times during the year are a real highlight of this hotel. Spa facilities were fine and not overly busy as we avided a Saturday to Sunday  stay.",positive
"The room space was very confined.,

The hosts where extremely friendly and helpful and their service was excellent.",positive
"The beds were a little small ,

Great location jut outside the hustle and bustle. Amazing breakfast and nice spacious rooms. Great customer service.",positive
"Rooms were quite dark, luxury room looked onto office block,  which made the room a little dark. I'm sure rooms at the front would be brighter.,

Very nice hotel, staff very friendly and helpful . 10 minute walk to main attractions, very comfortable beds, good bathrooms. Breakfast was nice too.",positive
"Our stay at Louise sur Cour has been short but truly unforgettable. I really recommend staying at the Suite King Deluxe which has a specious bathroom and a cozy bedroom. Also Dimitri is a very friendly host and great cook, don't miss his pancakes.I'll surely come back there next time Im in town.",positive
"Small & compact gite in stunning countryside village. Set on a cow - farm. Friendly family owners. A little noise from the cows & no washing machine, but still a lovely place to spend time. A walk to butchers & delicatessen & a 10 min drive to Dinant. Nice for a family of 4 for a few days.",positive
Good location. Lobby also works as pub in the evenings so you can meet local people. Drinks in lobby are cheap. Breakfast was reasonable.,positive
"Location of the hotel is great, the breakfast was amazing. But the best thing about the place is the owner. Magda is a super host.",positive
"For us, and this may have only been associated with our room! As a couple, we always prefer a double bed rather than two singles pushed together! However, we did not request this during our booking so there is a good chance that they would honour this request should we have made it. Also, in our room the shower head seemed to be in the wrong place & soaked the floor. Neither was a massive problem for us & didn't dampen our enjoyment of the weekend break we had.,

Overall, the hotel was clean & in a great location for all the things we wanted to see in Bruges. The staff were courteous & helpful, whatever we asked of them they were happy to assist. The breakfast was tasty with enough choice & you can eat as much of the buffet as you wanted.",positive
"No apparent policy on food waste.
Too much AC,  too cold in the breakfast restaurant,

The architecture. Somewhere in the past (1972) there was a great man (jo borgen) who did a great job. Today we benefit from this savoir faire without acknowledging it and unable to improve on him ....",positive
"The dinner was an already made dinner. It would have been better to have a dinner cooked at the hotel restaurant. The hotel owner is not guilty though, it's because of COVID-19 restrictions. ,

The terrace has a breathtaking view on the Meuse Valley.",positive
"Some of the furniture and carpets/walls were a little run down,

Comfortable and easy access to town centre and tourist attractions",positive
"pool would have been nice and it was a ten min walk from the prettier parts of Brussels.,

breakfast was the best i have ever had in a hotel. first class. if this hotel had a pool it would be perfect. it is still pretty close to perfect. Definately recommend it.",positive
Beautiful house with unique decor and a personal touch. The rooms are clean and the interior design is great! The host is super friendly and accommodating! I will look for nothing else when I come to Brussels again!,positive
"It was a bit dusty in parts, but a part from that very clean. 
With regards to the surroundings,there are some nice coutry walks to do from there, but unfortunately they are all roads where car travel too, so not so good if you have a dog. ,

The little village is gorgeous!",negative
"Very clean, the hospitality was great, the breakfast had variety from fruits to cereals to breads and spreads. The living area and kitchen was also clean and comfy with everything available to cook (pans, cutlery etc). Just 5-7 min walk from main market square !!! Overall very good experience.",positive
"Would have liked to stay for more than 1 night, maybe next time we visit Ypres we'll stay for longer.,

Breakfast was freshly cooked by host, which was delicious.  Very quiet location, great night's sleep.  Very close walking distance to centre of town.  Beautiful garden, beautiful house.",positive

Very close to the city centre",positive

Amazing property renovated by the owner (Dimitri) to perfection with his own amazing unique artwork on display, highly recommended. The owner was amazing and was really helpful and knowledgeable about the area. Location was perfect. Breakfast was perfect. It was the perfect stay. Highly recommended!",positive
"The flat was perfect, the only problem was the light in the bedroom. There was no blackout curtains, so there was too much light in the bedroom.",positive
"The location of the power socket near  the bed, it's obstructed by the top bed. ,

Everything, the cleanliness, facilities, big space. The free lockers. Presence of lifts. The breakfast was very good for a hostel.",positive
"Beautiful garden and roof terrace to relax in
Garaged parking for my motorbike",positive
"The layout is kind of funny, expect narrow stairs and no elevators. But you can’t beat the neat old building.,

Cool rooms in a great location. The breakfast was excellent. This hotel is perfect distance to the square and was so fun for the kids, very very clean, beds were comfortable. Quiet and spacious.",positive
"Everything ,

Nothing! Room was dirty and had an attack from bedbugs.
They didn’t do any efforts towards me, housekeeping checked the room for bedbugs and couldn’t find them? Ridiculous if you know that you can’t see those bugs and need to call a specialist to treat it with chemicals.
No refunds or suggestions.
Food poisoning from what, i don’t know cause I’ve ordered a lot.
Really a shame! 
My daughter had to sleep on the sofa cause they refused to unfold the sofa into a bed. But I’ve paid for a 2 bed room. 
Waist of money!",negative
Great view and super friendly host of the hotel. Very nice hotel with a great price value quality.,positive
"The rooms look dated and the baby cot furnished wasn’t a real baby cot. It looked like a make shift cot from a laundry trolley. The baby cot were also unfurnished despite being requested before our stay ,

Large modern room with great facilities & bathroom. Breakfast had a good choice, and Magda's bacon & eggs are a real treat! Easy walk to the main square.",positive
"As expected no parking at hotel ?? But reservation made at nearby additional charge car park .,

Looked for and found a very different property in s Central location .",positive
"The location is pretty amazing, right in the forest. The view from the room is really beautiful, with the trees and flowery bushes right outside the window. The hotel is very well maintained, the staff are superb, the swimming pool is very pleasant. The room is very comfortable, spacious and impeccably clean. The bed is very good, and it is very quiet at night, the sleep quality is amazing. The food for breakfast and room service meals is exceptional. It's very convenient to have a bike rental service on site. Overall, an excellent stay, we'll definitely be back!",positive

Breakfast was superb..fresh, varied and served with flair.  The room was a delight...oh so comfortable and spacious.  Location is perfect...short walk to interesting shops, the train and tram, and the lift down to the central part of the city (great walk via the antique shops).",positive
"The breakfast was better than I have had at many hostels. They had toast, eggs, coffee, milk, tea and orange juice. The room was also a super good size. I had a private double room, which was amazing. The location also perfect for Brugge, allowing me to keep going back to the hostel to drop off all the stuff I was buying!!",positive

Very helpful staff. Very good breakfast.",positive
"Food was not up to expectations, a bit overpriced. ,

The hotel was surrounded by nature, staff were friendly. We could easily rent bikes , play tennis and basketball and go to the swimming pool with a reservation. Breakfast included everything you needed and room was very modern and well equiped. We would go back for sure !",positive
We have loved our hosts and the view from the hotel restaurant! It was very enjoyable and Dominic was always a great support in any question we had.,positive

"Single room too small+ lamp & kettle  electrical cables too short,

breakfast + location + staff",positive
"Due to COVID, SPA is closed and access to the pool is limited upon reservation, but not actually controlled. We found the pool area to be too crowded a couple of times as guests tend to access without reservation or stay longer than allowed. Breakfast is served in-room and it's sufficient in quality and variety, although we had missing items all times and had to double ask waiters. The rental bike service, very important for us given the location in full forest, is barely sufficient as bikes are crap. I'd suggest a complete renewal of all equipment. Given the above, pricing is perhaps too high (executive room).,

Our second time in this place. We confirm our positive opinion about premises, staff (very helpful) and location, but we remarked a slight deterioration in general services and COVID measures.",negative
"Some staff members were arrogant,

The location is close to the shopping Center and public transport and variety of restaurants",positive

Every single thing !",positive

Breakfast was the biggest spread i have ever seen! great.",positive
"Everything was fine :),

A great hotel, located in the centre of Bruges with a very good breakfast and friendly - helpful staff!!",positive
"It’s a bit outdated. And the bedsheets wasn’t clean. But most of all it’s really unclear for a person who stays only for two days what you can or you can’t do. Yes it’s corona time. But I think it will be more clear for everybody if  in the rooms would be a sheet of paper with all the rules.,

Great staff.",positive
"Cold shower and we tried at several moments.
Choice for breakfast was very limited, you have to pay extra for an egg, not even the same amount of croissants per person prepared in the bag at our table.
Food for diner was average and small portion. We had to ask 3 times to order desert and after 30 minutes wait we gave up.
We were not told that you have to book nearly 2 weeks prior to your arrival spa treatment, swimming pool slots were nearly all taken when we did the check-in, etc...
It’s nice location and nice room but really expensive for the service ,

Location",negative

Second stay at Snuffel, it didn’t disappoint! It is very basic but had everything you needed. The breakfast was really good and the staff were lovely! See you again next year!",positive

We liked everything it was within walking distance to what we went to see and I would stay there again",positive
"Due to having the triple room our double bed was two singles put together which ment we found the mattress separated during the night. ,

Loved the staff, location and decor of the hotel. Great place to stay.",positive
"Upgrade program is a rip-off: I upgraded to ""High-floor"" and that just means 1st floor :-(The ""forest-view"" upgrade gave you a limited view to a garden with some trees but than with buildings at either side.Very difficult to find the number for room-service and once you find it, they don't answer.Restaurant is good but expensive.,

The surroundings, the room, the bathroom.Food at restaurant.Staff.",negative
"The shower door in room 307 didn’t close properly and there was a massive gab meaning all the water ended up on the floor. 
We were also told we had free breakfast but then when it came to it we had to pay.,

Great location, very clean and lovely decor! The bed is extremely comfy",positive
"Nothing ,

Amazing and beautiful design. Great host.",positive
"Well, these were just small things. Like the breakfast was that fancy as I expected to be, just a basic one. But the hostel is really big so I guess to feed everyone it's out of budget. But one thing that really brought this one down were the showers. The steam was so small and so weak it was almost impossible to take a proper shower what you would like after a long trip or after a long day out. It was kinda challenging to clean myself for I am big. But that's it, nothing more,

We were lucky enough to catch some Brazilian guys playing whole evening their guitars and singing for us so the atmosphere was absolutly amazing. We had a dance with my girlfriend and it was absolutly amazing. They have good beers on the tap and overal experience was really relaxing. They also have a pool football so it was great fun as well. The common place was really cozy and you felt good in there. Rooms were really big and the beds comfortable. Even the code lockers were really handy.

This was my second stay here and it was just as good. Comfortable room and the best breakfast. A really convenient location for all of the sites of Ypres. I would highly recommend.",positive
"There is no lift, so you need to carry the luggage via stairs. But this was a very small thing compared to the other good features of the hotel.,

Location is perfect! Very close to the Market square, the main place of the city. The breakfast is delicious, one of the best croissant I have ever had. The staff is very kindly too!",positive
"Staff was horrible.,

The hotel nice the area nice.",negative
"Difficult for us and for multiple cab drivers to find the hotel. Located at a large plaza with a traffic circle. However the hotel “sign” on the large 6 story building is a small vertical banner on the side of the building, black with dark letters.  Impossible to see at night. The small  neon sign is for the wine bar.No lobby or reception area, you enter thru the ground floor wine bar.  Hotel staff/check-in is a person with an iPad. Very Millennial, not that convenient. ,

Nice location, clean well furnished room with good bed, linens - and yes good pillows. 10 minute walk to Grand Place with many food options on the way. Staff was pleasant and helpful.",positive
"To be honest: nothing! :-),

Not very often I can say that: I liked everything! First of all the Host - Dimitri, I really appreciate your hospitality, openess to your guests and possibility of having an interesting conversation with you. :-) Then interior desing is just amazing. All decorations with a greate taste and very skillfully  juxtaposed old with new. Comfort bed, great breakfast served by the host every morning. I am just delighted. I hope to stay there again asap. :-)",positive

"The shower flooded the en-suite no matter how careful we were. It had great pressure but getting it to the right height and direction was pretty impossible.,

Good room size and the room had two chairs, most unusual nowadays! Separate toilet from the shower was good, although no sink in the toilet was unusual. Downstairs lounge area was comfortable, relaxing and warm! Great check-in and check-out experience with iPad brought to you on the sofa! Complimentary drink on arrival. Outstanding staff in all areas. Dinner in the hotel was excellent but breakfast a little complex, in that it was included but we weren't sure what exactly was included. For instance when asked if we wanted scrambled or fried eggs we opted for fried and we got one fried egg each on a plate, nothing else.",positive
"We found nothing to dislike and would stay with Dimitri again in a heartbeat.,

Lovingly renovated, the house was beautifully and tastefully decorated by the owner, Dimitri. He received us like we were old friends. His goal seems to be that we appreciate his house as much as he does, and that his guests are comfortable during their stay. The location is good, within walking distance to explore the old town center and many of the museums. Also close to restaurants and shopping in the newer centre.Overall, our stay was simply the best. Thank you Dimitri for your attention to detail in receiving and providing for your guests, and for sharing your beautiful abode.",positive

This hotel was without a doubt a major highlight of our European trip! Immaculate and simply gorgeous! We had a beautiful Art Deco inspired room which had the most amazing attached bath! The owner takes obvious pride in his B&B and his breakfast, amenities and service were first class! The rooms are well located, quiet and the touring information provided by the friendly owner was very much appreciated. Best choice ever for a lovely stay in Brussels!",positive
"At night could get loud and sleeping was tricky if you wanted to sleep with your window open because the cigarette smoke would travel up to your room from the smoking area outside. They provide ear plugs but theres nothing you can do about a smoky room at night.,

Very spacious and clean. Friendly staff, great social evening atmosphere. The breakfast was adequate and substantial. Hiring towels was very affordable and the location was a lovely walk away from the centre with out it being too central and close to the traffic.",positive
"Parking just a little down the street from the property. Arrived in the evening so there were spaces but it wasn’t entirely clear where was ok and where wasn’t. ,

The best place I've ever stayed certainly a grandure of opulence. Dimitri the owner takes pride in making his guests feel very good and very informative about the places to see and do. The breakfast he  cooks for us every morning is so delicious. A wow factor Bravo Dimitri see you next year.",positive
"Was a bit of noise from the courtyard outside but it was the weekend so this is to be expected, and it usually died down by about 12-1am. There was also a smell from the drains at certain times of the day in the shower room but this didn't impact on my stay too much. ,

Excellent facilities, free breakfast, secure entry to rooms, didn't need a padlock for the lockers and they were located in a separate area when you enter your room so you didn't disturb your roommates. Close to the centre with plenty of bars, restaurants etc within easy reach. Friendly staff members working on reception/bar area.",positive
"Very nice home, friendly host and everything we needed and more for our stay. Good location. Thank you",positive
Very friendly staff.  Charming and lovely hotel,positive
"There are no toiletries in the room, which is expected of a 4 star hotel. A sign in the bathroom welcomes guests to take a stroll to the reception (not that close in this colossal hotel) and to inspire them with toiletry requests. However, when we asked at the reception for a bar of soap, the receptionist searched for a minute and found out there wasn't any. He came back with conditioner...There is a minibar in the room, but it's empty. Here too a sign that encourages us to inspire them...The quality of the food in Restaurant Argan is disappointing and overpriced. A glass of wine for €9 but nothing special. These are prices of a high end hotel in Amsterdam.At the bar time has stood still. While the entire hotel's design is unwelcoming, the bar looks like East Germany during communism.I am a tall person, just under 2 meters. The ceiling in the wing where our room was located, was just over 2 meters, so my hear was scratching the plaster.The price of breakfast was the most shocking: €38,

The location of the hotel is excellent, in the middle of the Zoniën forest.",negative
its good location close the border,negative
"Very little. If I was being very picky I would say that our room was a little gloomy (room 4) having little natural light and could benefit from better lighting in the main room, but it was excellent in the bathroom.
Tea bags in the room would be appreciated by English guests together with proper milk in the fridge.,

Beautiful property with great attention to detail. Very clean and comfortable. Hosts were very friendly. Lovely quiet location but not far from Hasselt city.  Breakfast offering was good with fresh orange juice and a choice of eggs cooked to order. Looking forward to maybe staying in summer and enjoying a drink in the courtyard.",positive

This is my third visit and I’m always impressed. Stayed in a private room but have stayed in the dorm rooms before. It’s basic but as we only slept here it was exactly what we needed.",positive
"There were no negatives during our stay!,

"staff is not enough service oriented and too slow. they are not striving for excellence. we had ants in the room. they came to check it. they would send somebody afterwards. after half an hour waiting we called reception and the receptionist came herself to offer us another room. same type. afterwards we went to the spa, it was dirty(20:30) and the sauna was not hot. we called reception and they said they could not change it while there were at least still 20 people in the Spa. At 20:30 temperature starts already going down while it should close at 23:00. We paid a lot of money (266€ for one night - basic room). this is not the quality you expect for a 266€/night hotel.  the food in the restaurant is also not top. They make mistakes with tables, they forget a part of our order even. Don't take the desserts, its a trap and too low quality for this kind of hotel. nearly not eatable.  (paris-brest or chocomousse).,

nice environment, nice setting but service level is not according to the standard of the hotel. at first sight, service is good, but the finishing is bad, they are not accurate/precise. they forget things and are slow.",negative

"Left the hotel 5 hrs after arrival...
Chapter1: we wanted to have a weekend bbq outside of Brussels during nice weather. The facilities of the property showed bbq option, so it looked like a perfect place for it. During check-in I asked receptionist how can we use those. He answered that he has no clue and we will be called to the room. After 30 min waiting no call followed and we went for a walk, seeing receptionist leaving the building pretending not recognizing us.
Chapter2: i called the reception, explained the situation and now the lady told me she has no clue either, and someone will call in 30 min, as they have too much work to do checking in people... after 1 hr waiting no call followed, so we decided to check the pool. 
Chapter 3: there were no towels available in dressing room, so it took me 20 min to find any living person to ask for them, which also took quite some time to bring after.
Chapter 4: lobby bar tables were not cleaned, as a wine list barmen proposed “french” or “argentinian”,  which was also bad wine btw, so we decided to leave
Chapter 5. Departure. I asked for checkout at 8 pm and explained we never got any info on bbq and other issues. The manager kindly explained me that 1) they do not have bbq facilities since a long time 2) its not a problem of Dolce what is written on Booking.com in the list 3) no reimbursement is possible, even the one of extra payment for the dog which we made during check-in. Here, to be objective he proposed free breakfast as compensation, but we really did not want to stay anymore
Conclusion: if you are not a group of 100 people to occupy conference hall, the property (which is 4 star hotel btw) does NOT care about customers... anyhow it’s forest (which is the only nice part there), so nowhere to run...

A little bit too cold in the room.,positive
"Very cheap and everything objective was fine, but with a an air of past glories - very clean, but with peeling paint. The town was similar, with a Gothic basilica opposite and the border a few metres away. It is a real throwback, in a 60s time warp. If you are on a limited budget and are tired of the squeaky clean chain hotels, it is well worth the detour.",positive
"It was near a construction site and we requested that it was a romantic getaway and yet we got a room facing the construction side which was horrible. We could could not open the windows as it got insanely loud. I say avoid this hotel completely till that construction is over.,

The decor was lovely.",negative
Perfect stay!!,positive
Everything .. Best at all,positive
"No on-site parking available and very few public parking spaces available near-by which resulted in carrying our luggage 1.5 km. Make sure to book the parking offered by the hotel if you are visiting on the weekend when the parking garages fill up OR arrive by public transport. Biekorf is the closest garage. We paid 16 euro for two days at 'T Zand park house. Though we liked our room, it was on the third floor with VERY steep and narrow stairs. This would be challenging for older guests. There are few common areas available to guests for lounging or meetings.,

The staff was especially friendly and helpful. Breakfast was wonderful and cozy; beds comfortable; hot water in the shower. The rooms were surprisingly quiet despite being in the centre of the city. We loved the Old World feel of the building and the history.",positive
"On our last day leaving the hotel for a connection to our train in Brussels the hotel charged us an exhorbitant fee for a taxi then forgot to place reservation with the taxi company. Fortunate our skillful drive managed to get us to our train in time.  The hotel should inform guests that they are adding a substantial charge for booking a taxi;  of course forgetting to call the taxi was unacceptable in any setting,

This is in a very convenient and quiet location with free parking opposite yet a mere 5 minutes' walk from the centre of Ypres and 15 minutes' walk from the Menin Gate. Nice sized room with a good en-suite. The host was very friendly and helpful (tip: take his recommendations for places to eat). The breakfast was well presented, high quality and plentiful.

(We were passing through & most hotels near the highway were not available. And were a little uncomfortable with the kinky deco. Of course, after overcoming the unease, everything was clean & OK),

First see comments of what we didn't like. So after overcoming the unease, the extras (in our case, a sauna within the room) was actually quite a bonus.You can book a simple breakfast for 10€ per person (delivered to your room).",positive

Great location, close to supermarket, restaurants, metro, taxis.  Very central.
Apartment had all we required - kitchen with plenty of utensils, clean bed linen, small bathroom but good shower

"My French is sub-GCSE and reception made no attempt to slow down to help me understand, despite asking. The whole place is almost derelict and has seen better days. The bar in the square below was occupied by scary looking men. I wouldn't have been happy to have stayed here on my own. There is only street parking but it is free.,

First of all, I was impressed with your helpfulness and kindness upon my arrival, and with the way you made sure everything was just right. I also appreciated your taking the time to discuss some of Antwerp's attractions with me.I greatly enjoyed my stay in Antwerp, and your lovely CityHome apartment had a lot to do with that. I could hardly believe how well-appointed it was! All the amenities and utensils were there, far more complete than in a regular hotel room. I was quite impressed how well everything worked, including the many kitchen gadgets and, particularly, the warm (and hot!) water supply in the kitchen as well as in the perfectly designed shower. Such a delightful and comfy place all around... Many thanks!Martin Werner",positive

I very much enjoyed my stay in this great city also because of the accommodation.
Can't wait to be back when I hope for the flat to be available. Thank you!

"Staff at the hotel was not really friendly, when we arrived to check in it looked like we  were a burden and they wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. Cleaning was not good - litter left around the place. There were no slippers or bathrobe provided even though there is a swimming pool downstairs but it is winter, nobody has any appropriate footwear to go use the facilities and we saw people walking either in their socks or barefoot. Overall, I'd say that this was the worst Novotel I've stayed at, other ones were much better.,

"The apartment/guest house consist of two large and delicate rooms, with a very small kitchen located in the hallway/top of the stairs connecting the two rooms. Though this kitchen is exclusively yours, it’s not locked off from others staying in the Collectors house. ,

Nice and super central apartment, with comfy beds and stylish bathrooms.",positive
"Nothing ,

Free parking right outside  and great continental breakfast",positive
Apartment at the heart of all the activities in the old town.,positive
"The wifi didn't work. Had to be moved to another room because the fire escape was used by smokers who then sat on our windowsill ensuring smoke got in if the window was opened, also peace and privacy did not exist. In the new room the shower had not been used for ages so the drain had dried up and stank. Unfortuately the window was broken so could not be opened properly to air the place. By then we had given up the will to complain and just put up with it.,

The thing I liked most about our stay was leaving.",negative
Location,negative
"The taps in bathroom were very loose.,

The location of this hotel is perfect - 5min walk to the Markt where pretty much everything is. It's a 5min taxi ride from the train station too. The hotel has so much character, very historic and even has a kick of modern in the corridor. Our room had an enormous fireplace, wooden beams and chandelier so we weren't disappointed. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great, lots of choices and cool basement.",positive

Great Room, staff and breakfast! Excellent rate, Prime location!!",positive
Everything is good，host real nice，I feel at home，definitely will choose Cityhome if I come to Antwerpen again！,positive
"The staff isn’t very helpful. They charged me 50 extra euro for a 2 hour late check out. The breakfast is terrible, I had never seen a restaurant so packed. The location is nice though.",negative
"The loo was a bit uncomfortable, very high off the floor!The duvets were too thick for us, but sleeping without them was too cold.   A sheet and blanket as an alternative would have been good, although we didn't actually ask if this could be provided.,

Excellent breakfast.   Old historic building with ambience.",positive
"They had huge lockers to fit all your stuff and it felt very secure, a seperate room for sleeping and a seperate room for lockers. The main bar is open to locals too and I met many nice people in the common area!",positive
"All facilities present, even possibilities for cooking - just great! Very nice style of the house, modern but warm and cosy.",positive
The hosts was very friendly! The room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was excellent!,positive
Very comfortable apartment in a great location. Both rooms very generously sized with good bathrooms.,positive
"The shower leaks and the host did not provide any sort of toiletries.,

Breakfast was simple and adequate. Location is amazing!",positive
"The hostess could have given us a warning regarding the running out of the hot water. Apparently, it works on a water heater or something and once, when I was going for a shower, there was no hot water. That was annoying, but everything was ultimately solved. Also, the coffee machine didn't work but that was probably just me not knowing how it worked lol,

The house was super cozy and comfortable, with an amazing location right at the city's historic center. Very clean and super warm with 2 air conditioning systems. The TV worked great, the kitchen was super functional and had everything one could need and the hostess was super nice and very available.",positive

the location was for this trip excellent.",negative
Beds are heaven on earth and the staff is exceptional,positive
"Had to get housekeeping to clean up cobwebs on ceiling.  At check-out, the computer did not work so we had t wait while the lady figured out what to do, but we were in a rush to catch a train.   A little nerve racking. Not enough counter space in the bathroom.,

Breakfast area and food was amazing.  Nice little private patio. Room was good size and had everything needed. Modern bathroom.",positive
"It's quite a walk from the market square esp if you have big luggages.,

Very clean and organized. Breakfast buffet is great. Bike rental is cheaper compared to other dealers",positive

Great. Location, gorgeous gardens and lots of amenities",positive
"As the apartment is right by the tram tracks the front room is pretty noisy, especially on a Saturday night. Very steep stairs up to the second floor! ,

Beautiful aesthetics throughout. Lovely living space and many thoughtful touches. The apartment is very well located in a busy part of the town. Very friendly and helpful host.",positive
"Such friendly and helpful hosts where nothing was a problem. Thanks for getting us out of a sticky situation when caught up in the French train strikes. Beautiful breakfast, lovely rooms, so clean. Free car parking right outside the door!! So glad we stayed here.",positive

Owners very heplful, easy to contact.  Jan was there to let us in and explain how the controls worked.",positive
"Reservation said room would be minimum 25 m² (it was around 15 m²). No complimentary water. Normally I wouldn't care, but at 250 euros for the night, I would have expected better and I would have expected a room that corresponds to the reservation.,

Good location. standard quality.",negative
"There wasn’t a sink in the toilet. You have yo go to the shower room to wash your hands.,

It had everything a traveller needed. The bed was big and comfortable. Exceeded 4-star.",positive
"Loved the hotel, Loved the city, Loved the people!! The only thing we didn't like was that we had to leave so soon :(,

Breakfast was delicious, with a continental spread offered and hosts cooking eggs scrambled, fried or boiled. Room was a very good size, as was the bathroom which was very modern and clean. We had the window open all night and didn't hear a thing other than the church bells in the distance. This was a pleasant surprise to us as the hotel is literally a 2 minute walk to the main centre. Parking is available in a nearby underground private carpark that is accessible at all times during your stay",positive
"Located 2,3km from Bruges station. Walking distance to Markt. Spacious room and clean. Love the bar in the ground floor. There is a live music and nice place to meet new people.",positive

The vegan option for breakfast.",positive
"Smart lighting system drove us crazy during the weekend. The lights were turned on and off at midnight while we slept even if we turned it off. This system is not necessary for a small apartment like this.,

Excellent location, clean and brand-new renovated flat with all facilities needed it. Very cozy, clean, decorated with taste, fully equipped apartment. Perfect location, two minutes from the cathedral. Easy to get there. For the collection of keys, we phoned the owner who opened us the main door remotely.",positive

Location was excellent.",negative

Beautiful decor and space in an old house.  Amazing location with funky restaurants and shops.  Lovely and welcoming hosts.  Highly recommend this accommodation for couples and friends.",positive
"There was nothing not to like,,

Parking immediately outside, host was very welcoming, showed us maps of area and explained what was to be seen locally. Helped with cases to our room, and checked we had everything we needed. The room had a plentiful supply of tea coffee and milk. Breakfast every morning was very comprehensive and more than met with our total satisfaction, coffee was fresh and plentiful and the owners kept themselves discretely out of the room but were available whenever required. There was no rush to check out and we intend to return next year.",positive
"This is more a suggestion: even if it wasn't a problem for us it would be better to make clear that the second double bad is not easily accessible,

Position, Kitchen Equipment,",positive
"Clearly a rip-off. Rooms are smalland dirty. Carpet in corridor and room is particularly filthy. My room wasnot cleaned properly, toilet and bathroom only marginally cleaned. We allknow that chain hotels, such as Novotel, are not the most classy or stylish but that is compensated by a good price ratio (value for money) but 325 Euro for two nights for a 4 star hotel is definitely not a deal. This hotel is not recommendable, definitely NOT for business travellers! (no parking)",negative
"Beyond the hotel’s control, i know, but the construction around the hotel is somewhat of a nuisance.,

The staff is very warm and welcoming and offered us a glass of wine (or coffee) and snacks immediately upon our arrival, which we enjoyed while checking in.",positive
"The only thing that we didn't like was our shower didn't stay in the right position it kept dropping down, so we had to tie it up with a plastic bag,

The location is perfect, the hotel is situated on a main road into Bruges city centre, our room was at the back, there's a church opposite which rang the bells from 8am every hour. Breakfast is included and they take your every need into account, very friendly, they give you a free map of the city and mark any location you want to visit",positive
"Nothing !! Super Wow ,

The stuff specialy ( rodoph and Louize ) 
The bicycle Rent so cheap and the best way in town , 
The location is rly Excellent .",positive
"It was difficult to get a good night's sleep with noise from the traffic below seeming to go on all night. Lots of roadworks nearby.,

The breakfast was superb, particularly the bacon eggs cooked to order. There were multi choices to suite eveyoneVery friendly atmosphere enhanced by access for most to roof garden",positive
"It all worked for us. ,

The central location was excellent & Arno the owners were very helpful. It was a perfect setup for a family of 4 with 2 teenage boys.",positive
"Very welcoming and great location for Yper centre. Coming by car free parking opposite the premises,which is great because parking in Yper can often be problematic.",positive
"You need to be a mountain goat to get up the stairs - don't on any account arrive with anything more than hand luggage or a backpack. The automated lighting system takes a little time to become accustomed to. The owners do not live on the premises and open the doors by remote control - so you need a mobile phone.,

Ideal location in the heart of the old town, within easy strolling distance of the main sights. Compact, spotlessly clean apartment, in a converted old town house.",positive
"We arrived to hotel at 16.00 and our room was not clean yet.... so we needed to take one hour walk around the city. After we came the other receptionist (guy with glasses) didint even said sorry for inconvenience. No recompensation!!! Room was not as clean as should be but I assume that staff needed to hurry!!! Could be very nice hotel but staff needs to upgrade the service.,

Room size. Big plus for receptionist (he was speaking Polish:)). Very kind and welcoming person. The only one from the reception staff who was smiling and care for guests needs...",negative
"The bathroom was a little on the small side. Breakfast was an optional extra of Euro 25, which is too expensive.,

Lovely lobby and entrance to the hotel. The room was nice, simply and stylish (but not large). Great location - only a 5 minute walk to the centre. I would recommend this hotel.",positive
"Room lovely, but booked because older worldly and our room very modern, and painting building so entrance like shop front. Xxxx",positive

The location was fantastic - situated within the historic district with all the sights, restaurants, cafes, bars etc nearby. Our host was always on hand if needed. The apartment was so stylish with everything we needed.",positive
"Nothing,

Lovely room , with a brilliant balcony",positive
"I felt cheated. When booking, I booked a queen bed and it showed a picture of a studio with a queen bed in it. When arriving, I walked into an entirely different looking space (cheap looking and smelling like cigarettes) that had a twin bed. When texting the hosts, they told me that the bed pulls out to a full. There was a major lack of transparency about which room I actually booked. I didn’t complain because I was only staying two nights and trying to sleep off a 9 hour jetlag.,

Location and accessibility",negative
"Strange lay-out in a large room. About 1/3 of room bare except for a wardrobe and no illumination. I mentioned to front desk staff but wondered how they would address since could see no electrical outlet in the area and only a dim light over a mirror outside the bathroom. They did nothing. The toilet is separate in small “water closet.”  Door opens inward and a challenge for anyone large or not flexible to enter and exit. One side of the bed was about a foot away from the wall even though there was plenty of room on the other side to allow increase of a foot or more. The desk/table too could have been larger without crowding.,

Corner room with views was large and quiet. Good bed reading lights. Plenty of in-room coffee provided for Nespresso machine.",negative
"All the great reviews about this hotel are true! Such a lovely hotel, our ""home away from home"" in Brussels! Modern, clean, confortable, centrally located and with the most amazing staff! Thank you all!",positive
"The hotel was brilliant. Nice and chic. Would have loved a bath tub but not too fussed. Also cheaper if you book there instead of booking.com. Also the aircondition didn't have a warm setting. I was sort of cold at one point.,

Lovely breakfast
Happy staff. Very attentive. I had an operation so i asked for extra pillows and the receptionist bought me one straight away.  Receptionist sho2ed me nice places to eat on a map and reccomended things to do. Minutes a way from the centre by foot.",positive

"Could hear the street noise despite being on the 4th floor. was hopping for even a mini GYM. the shower is not well shielded and water always splash out, very risky for slipping.,

The hotel is on main street, making every thing accessible within 5-10 minutes walking. neat room. The reception and hotel staff are extremely nice and helpful. Housekeeping are simply awesome.",positive
"The location is perfect! The hotel was well maintained, our room was spacious with all the amenities mentioned. Towels changed both days we stayed there. Breakfast was excellent, with big variety. Ladies who prepare and serve breakfast are more than welcoming, polite and always with a smile and a nice word. Overall a very nice experience",positive
"Hard to say. Maybe towel on rent for 1 euro. ,

Excellent staff, supportive and smiling. Good breakfast, clean rooms, shower private and so bathroom. Location is 10 minutes walk from main square. Lockers available for free if you need to store your bag before departure.",positive

"No problems.,

Breakfast and friendliness of the owners.😺",positive
"I am a solo female traveler. One afternoon a man turned a key and entered the apartment looking for something from the kitchen, told me he was the owner, he did not even knock at the door. I felt very unsafe for the rest of my stay and ensured the door was locked and the key was in the back of the door to stop this happening again. Absolute awful experience",negative
"No parking,

City centre everything in walking distance",negative

This is a lovely boutique hotel within walking distance of Brussels Midi station. The staff were the best I have encountered in a long time. Attentive, helpful and just so friendly. 
The beds are so comfortable and the whole hotel has a lovely clean feeling about it.",positive
"The little sachets of soaps and shampoos The mattress,

The staff was very friendly. Location bang in the centre but it was very quiet too. The breakfast was excellent.The only thing is that the mattress was a bit too soft. Although the sachets of shower gels and soaps were adequate, it would be better for the environment to provide these in dispensers.",positive
"So noisy at night. Television and music working until late. Also everyone speaking loud ,

Clean. Good location",positive
"Good location only a few minutes walk from the town centre.Breakfast had an excellent selection of food available.",positive
"Not a 'con' exactly, but the narrow helical stairs up to the second floor would prove difficult for some including those with visual impairment. Also, the front room does get some noise from the trams outside so light sleepers should opt for the back bedroom. I managed fine in the front room with ear plugs. Other than that it was a very comfortable and convenient place to stay.,

On arrival we were met by Arno who was pleasant and friendly, explaining everything we needed to know. The apartment is in an excellent location for visiting the old centre of Antwerp. It is also only about 20 mins walk from the main train station, we managed it easily both times with suitcases, but there is a handy tram stop just outside. The accommodation offers large, nicely furnished rooms with high ceilings. The building is old and characterful.",positive
"A short walk into town. Very pleasant & welcoming host who was graciously accommodating to our request for an early breakfast. Comfortable, clean and modern rooms in a quiet residential street.

Our booking company failed to inform the owners we have a child, however in the morning we had a gift waiting for our daughter at Breakfast. Nele also advised us about the Ypres Museum which our daughter enjoyed looking for the 9 cats on the tour. Would definitely recommend, a 5min stroll from the centre of Ypres.",positive
"Fairly shambolic arrangements for breakfast. No self service.  Waiters regularly brought the wrong dish or someone elses dish and charged to wrong room.

comfortable bedroomslocation",positive
"Great location reasonable price ,comfortable room and good breakfast",positive

Great location in quiet, arty area. Locker in room. Basic breakfast included with decent coffee. Good value place, especially if you're travelling alone and just need somewhere basic to lay your head for the night.",positive
"Wow, where do I start?  Everything was amazing, our room was spotlessly clean, very comfortable and the shower was excellent.  Location of the property is perfect for walking into town.

They give you a bed number (not bad itself, but I don't understand why and it just creates complications between the guests).

The staff immediately made us feel very welcome and comfortable.  They made all the difference to our stay.  They were helpful in every way.  They seemed to be able to manage everything in their stride.  The huge bed was fabulously comfy.  The pillows were firm enough, yet still squashy.  The air conditioning was quiet.",positive
"The location was excellent, walkable to everything we wanted to see. The room was spacious and comfortable, we had the room right on the street but still felt like it was private and quiet at night.

"Description doesn't fit- there are only 2 rooms, which one is a bedroom and second room has bed and sofa  (sitting area) and dining table. Heavy noise from the street (from early morning), so loud and influencing room with heavy vibration. Even Booking showed us 2beds and sofa (booked for 3adults and 1 child) should have payed for one extra person to get linens for sofa bed (not in line with description). One bathroom was really cold. ,

Location and the hotel overall.",positive
"The only thing I didn't like were the showers, because the water pressure was so low I struggled to get my hair wet and the shampoo washed out. That's a minor issue though.
And the price was high in comparison to what I'm used to, however you get everything you'd expect for that price as well.,

The hostel is very new, modern and clean. It does, however not lack in cozy atmosphere. Location is great, still located in the old town but in a very calm area and 10min walk (max) to the center. 
The staff is very nice and most people staying in the hostel seemed to be rather young. It was still very calm though.
They have a big breakfast with vegan options, big lockers, no complications at all, a bar and a wifi/lounge area, ...
I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely book there again if I were to come to Bruges again.",positive

"Not a real concern for me but might be for some - my room faced the street (and a nice fountain) but on a Saturday night in Brussels there was the occasional loud street noise. Ask for a room at the back if a light sleeper.,

Customer service is very good at this hotel. The rooms are nice - quite standard but of good quality - very clean - 5-10 minutes to the market square. Restaurant and coffee very nice. Sit out on the terrace if weather permits.",positive

Good Breakfast even with champagne in the weekend! Nice location, even with the tram in front it's still quiet inside",positive
"The address is shown as Malmedy. It is outside the town and our lady inside the satnav couldn't find the location. It would help if the address was listed as Malmedy , but an added in brackets  suburb listing would help (the lady inside the gps) to find the exact place( Xhoffrax),

Located in a forested part of Malmedy, about 7  kilometres outside the town in an area with a rural setting. Very comfortable.

The staff were warm and welcoming. The rooms was large and comfortable and we were given great recommendations for food and options during the COVID pandemic where restrictions were heavy. It’s the perfect spot to stay for hikes in all directions.",positive

"Heard some banging noise coming from just above my room or just outside around 4 am (n°307), may have been related to the storm outside. 
Staff at breakfast seemed overrun. 
18 euros for breakfast is a bit too much, even if it's good. ,

Comfortable bed, clean room and shower, very good breakfast. 
Check out at 11 on weekends.",negative
"When I made the reservation it was written that a parking was available at the hotel. Once we arrived and asked for the parking we were told that we should have reserved the parking before (but this was not specified neither written anywhere when I made the reservation) so we had to look for an other pay parking in the city.,

We were allowed to leave our luggages at the reception of the hotel even before the check in time. The location of the hotel is great, very close to the centre and to the beach.",positive

"For two young women like us taking the steep staircase to the third floor wasn’t a big problem but if you’re impaired in mobility this may be a bit of a hassle. Besides, the accommodation may want to consider having a fire escape ladder (and an extinguisher) because it felt a bit scary that the staircase was our only exit. ,

Really neat, clean, and modern apartment including all facilities you’d need! 
Also, the host was very hospitable, friendly, and quick to reply to our messages. We’d definitely recommend the place :).",positive

"Bathrooms have some mold here an there. For a night of stay may be acceptable, but not for long stay, risk getting something from those. TV very small and difficult to watch.,

Host was very helpful with the breakfast, given that due to Corona-Virus rules we had to serve it in the room : they have installed a table in the room for this purpose.  Very quiet place, I slept very good.  Very friendly host. Could set by my own the heat level on the radiators.",positive
"I needed one single paper copied and scanned and it was too bad that the staff did not aloud me to do so. I understand that the hotel is no copy center but it was just a very small request to avoid me the extra hassle of having to drive to a distant copy shop.,

The staff was very friendly, despite the restrictions related to COVID 19. The rooms met our expectations: they were spacious and very clean. The breakfast was tasty and it was nice to be able to take a breakfast outside in the sun.",positive
"Could have done with a stocked fridge, some dumpy beers and milk would have been good, as there are no grocery type shops nearby that we found. The owner does leave small pots of cream/coffee/sugar etc but more would have been handy.,

Very friendly owners, we had a garage to park the motorbikes in. We had a complete floor to ourselves. The decor is a bit basic but good enough. Warm and comfortable accommodation. Breakfast was good quality and plentiful. The location is ideal being only a few minutes walk from the town center and about 10 min walk from the Menin Gate.",positive

"The floors inbetween the appartments are not so sound proof. There are slippers provided at the door probably for this reason, unfortunately our upstairs neighbors were not as courteous and seemed to be prepping for a marathon every morning at 6 am.,

Gorgeous view of the castle, such a nice kitchen, fully equipped. Modern furniture and big TV for a cosy night in. Spar for groceries nearby. Fluffy pillows! Helpful host when internet dies at 9pm. Local chouffe beer assortment in the fridge upon arrival. Great starting point for multiple nature walks, be sure to get your route map at the tourist info around the corner. Close to lots of restaurants. Host also provides a laundry room with washer and dryer. Almost felt like a pre-covid holiday! We had a great stay!",positive

breakfast was excellent",positive
"The rudeness of the waiter during the breakfast, he grabbed my 2 years old son son violently. I don't think it was appropriate due to my son's behavior.

Basic continental breakfast, but very tasty with all you could ask for. Staff were very friendly.",positive

"The room was very, very, very different from the picture on the web page. Small, old, with old furniture. The bed is without a table, directly on the wall, very uncomfortable, only 2 pillows, also uncomfortable. Bed linen didn’t smell fresh, were old, frayed and worn with stains. The terrace was dirty. Wi- fi was slow. Draining from the shower was slow. No hangers in the bathroom. No mini fridge in the room. I can’t recommend!!!,

Very spacious room, beds moderately comfortable.  Very centrally located, less then 10 minutes walk from main square. The staff was kind and helpful. Decent buffet breakfast. You could leave the luggage in a storage room for as much time as you wished.",positive
perfect locality,positive
"better communication about the parking situation,

While we could have learned via my email question that the best place to park was the local parking garage (instead of driving to the hotel, parking on the street, and then moving to the garage....), the staff were great and even gave us a pitchet of coffee after we asked for more than just a small cup for breakfast.  (The rest of the breakfast was abundant and good.)",positive
"The apartment with castle view is excellent. It is spacious and cosy, has all the equipment necessary. The kitchen is great to prepare meals while the restaurants are closed.

"My daughters and I stayed her as part of our family visit to WW1 cemeteries where relatives are buried. We ""did"" France and finished our trip in Ypres, on the way to the ferry. As we planned to attend the Last Post Ceremony I chose it as it was centrally-located. Another great choice! It was easy to get to - it's on a sort of inner ring route, with free on-street parking right opposite the hotel. My daughters had an upstairs room with balcony. This overlooked the garden and was very relaxing. The owners welcomed us in a most friendly way and made sure we were happy with the facilities. The bedrooms were bright, airy, each with its own bathroom and a comfortable double bed. The bathrooms were spacious with a big shower cubicle. It was within 5-10 mins walk of the main centre of Ypres and the Menin Gate, with a wide choice of good restaurants, cafés and bars. The main square in Ypres hosts an excellent market and other events, but was simply a car-park while we were there.Breakfast was really good: a wide choice of fresh croissants and breads, together with cereal, etc. Coffee (or tea if preferred) was plentiful and tasty.The Owners have worked hard to create a comfortable and welcoming place to stay and it shows. The place was spotless. Their advice was happily given on places to visit as well as restaurants/bistros to go to. There is a wide selection of tourist leaflets and booklets on display for visitors to use. It was a shame that we were only there for one night.All in all, I recommend this establishment highly. It is close to the centre, parking is adjacent and free and the town is a great place to wander around with a great choice of eateries (we went to the Ypres Burger restaurant, billed as the finest in Ypres - guess what...it is!).We would certainly come here again, it was a such a nice place to stay.",positive

"There was not even a small vacuum or a manual brush to clean up the floor, only a little one. With 2 children under 4 it would be useful. I would suggest even, that a cheap automatic robot would do, it would be a great addition. ,

It was very clean and all the necessary appliances were available.",positive
"The room was very bright once the sun was up. The curtains are very thin and bright and we were on the sunny side, so it was as bright inside as outside. It was also partially very loud due to some heavy door that was often opened and closed.,

The staff was friendly, the bed was comfortable and the shower was good. The breakfast was very good. The price was also appropriate.",positive

"The toilet had an unpleasant odor that kept us up at night.  There was also a bright light from the street that shone in our windows until about 23.00.  Finally, the breakfast was very basic compared to the other places we stayed during the week.,

The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The location was perfect, close to the beach and the station.  We also had plenty of space in our room for two adults and one child.",negative
"We didn't have any dislikes, we really couldn't fault the B & B, the people and town were both friendly and accomodating.,

The B & B was very close to the city centre only a 5/10 min walk. The facilities were very good, the owners couldn't do enough for you, they gave us lots of information to help our visit,  nothing was too much trouble.  Parking was great across the road and was free. Very comfy beds, tea and coffee available in the rooms, great breakfast, we could go on but we would definitely recommend this B & B and will definately return.",positive

"Letting people know the room key opens the front door too we got caught in the rain.,

The excellent breakfast. Very quiet.",negative
"The photos led me to believe that the gracious curved and arched exterior was the hotel entrance. Actually it is a view down a side street next to the hotel.  It’s an old hotel made of multiple buildings so we had to go through hallways, out back through a courtyard, then into another building and up some very steep narrow stairs to get to our rooms.,

Location, location.  Near Market square and several excellent restaurants, yet not in the most crowded areas so quiet at night. Great breakfast. Very cordial staff.  Our family of four got two rooms and they adjoined and one was very spacious, the other not too small.",positive
"Confused that they didn’t know it was the carfree day in Mechelen when we were there and they did not really have advice on whether we would be able to get out by car on the Sunday when I rang to ask about it. In fact they gave us the wrong advice about the timings but that was due to a misprint in local paper. We solved’it ourselves with using town edge parking and taxi.
Bit strange that all the cleaners tackle was just dumped in the corridor next to our room when we arrived and room next to us was wide open and it stayed like that all night, as if cleaner had just downed tools and left.,

No problem that we arrived very late evening after attending a wedding, night staff checked us in cheerily.
View of St Rombauds from window - if you looked along side of building.
Modern room though just a bit cheerless - could do with a bit more colour or decoration.
Modern led lighting strips.
Excellent breakfast though it did cost 18€ per person.
Very easy walking distance to Mechelen sights.
Friendly and helpful staff, had a solution for everything - lockable baggage store available after checkout until we wanted to depart. Helpful in calling us a taxi and suggested we use the lounge bar until taxi arrived on our departure.
We have good impressions of our short stay here. Liked the small outdoor areas on each floor. Could be even better used if there was seating on them.",positive

Warm welcome from the front desk staff. A really fabulous central location in Bruges but at modest prices. Good breakfast served safely in the room in covid constrained  times. Lovely art work on the walls around the hotel. Safe bicycle parking has to be arranged in the hotel car park.",positive
"Nothing the apartment can help, but in summertime, in the centre, every night there is quite loud music and talk explaining the history of the village. It lasts about twenty minutes.,

Excellent quality of interior, finishing and all the amenities: all available like tea and coffee, washing up liquid, la chouffe beers, oil to cook, shampoo even chocolates for the kids.
To our surprise there was also a netflix account to be used!!
Location is spot on, right in the city centre, within a minute you can get food from the supermarket, fresh bread from the bakery, pick up pizza's, or visit the tourist information.
Plenty of parking to (un) load, a short walk from free parking.
Dishwasher and dishwasher tablets available, all clean and made beds. Excellent.

"A bigger table or the addition of another small table in the room.  As we ordered food to eat in the room(for a family of four) was a little hectic with the kids and the furniture available in the room.,

The staff, the parking, the bar patio, the location (very centrally located).  The environment of the hotel was magic.  The attentiveness with the breakfast and the accommodations to order food out and bring it into your room or being able to enjoy it in the patio outdoors.",positive

"In my room, I don't have wifi connection. It was the biggest disadvantage, the second one room was placed at the end of the very, very long corridor when I reached the end I was a little bit tired :P Elevator is a little bit frightening,

Great localization, it was really close to the sea, shops, restaurants. Check-in and check-out process was fast and without any problem, the staff is professional. From my window, I can go to something like fire escape stairs which was really awesome, this is the biggest advantage of this place.",negative
"Covid measures? This of course gives some restrictions but we don't felt anyway restricted by our hotel. This means in fact NOTHING! Ty!!!!,

The hotel is located near to the (shopping) center of Brugge, approximately 1,5 km from the central rail station. We've been there during the heaviest Covid-19 measures the country has known. We felt really secure during our stay and even it was different from everything we knew, we really enjoyed. Breakfast was served at booked time in the hotel room and at Brugge you're able to take-away your dinners in person or order takeaway, deliveroo or uber. This went a great stay for us in Bruges!",positive

"The hotel is bit old and the rooms are not very well sound proof. So you (almost) hear everything - the bags rolling, shower in the adjacent room, people talking. But we were there only for one night so was not a big deal for us. If you are looking for a quite place to stay, probably not the best option.,

Good location, friendly staff.",positive
Good price value balance,positive
"The bathroom was a bit small, and some parts of the hotel look as if they could use a renovation.,

"We were in a room up 2 flights of stairs so a bit difficult with 2 suitcases weighing 18 kg each!  Perhaps you might put those traveling from afar eg Australia on lower levels?  Many travelling from a distance come to Europe for a few weeks, so have more luggage.  Next time we will request a room on a lower floor.  But we enjoyed our stay and loved your town.,

Location was absolutely fantastic.  Breakfast was quite fine without being outstanding.  Lovely staying in a building with character and history.    The hosts were very helpful with recommendations for dinner.  Loved Poules et Moules!",positive

Friendly owners. Easy access. Great brekkie. Owner dropped us at the train station when we left. Lovely people and the B & B had a great atmosphere. Recommended for a stay in Ypres.",positive
"Not a lot. A few minor items in the room eg the socket I used for the iron comes away from the wall - I think others have had the same problem, due the short (& tied to the board) lead on the iron.  I don't like the packet / instant coffee, as provided in the room, but that is probably to be expected.,

Friendly staff, great location, quite and a good breakfast.",positive

Really nice hotel with friendly staff and good quality room.",positive
"Stairs are quite steep with narrow treads, not easy for people with mobility issues.Mattresses were soft, but that is down to personal preference.,

Good location, easy to walk into the centre of town. On street parking (watch out for different zones where time is limited / charges)We had two double rooms, one had a small en-suite, the other had its own toilet and shower facilities just outside the room. Tea / coffee making facilities on landing. Lovely  roof terrace and / or garden to sit out in.Breakfast was amazing!",positive

Due to the policy of the hostel, i could not change with the old man. Poor guy!! The female staff in the morning in bad mood answer the question impatiently,

Kitchen full with different Utensil and all you can use! Clean and comfortable room! It is very easy to get Markt.",positive

Location, friendly staff",negative
"All good.,

Clean confortable.",positive
"The hotel pre-authorised almost the full amount of our stay about 10 days before our arrival. After our stay they stated that the blocked amount will be charged plus the city taxes, but beside the blocked amount they charged the full amount as well. I know that some hotels have this custom, and I would be ok with it was I to know ahead, however this was not stated in the hotels policy.,

The hotel is located very close to the main square. Close enough to walk there in about 2-3minutes, but far enough not to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle and noise. The staff was very very kind, made us feel very welcomed. The breakfast was good, the eggs are prepared fresh upon your request, and again the lady was super kind.  She prepared a very good hot chocolate. The room was arranged very beautifully and authentically, with a more modern bathroom. The whole building has an authentic atmosphere, with a nice thin staircase. The whole city of Brugge feels like time travel and our stay at this hotel complemented this feeling. I strongly recommend it!",positive

Lovely old fashioned style of the room",positive
"Room and bathroom were smaller than  expected from pictures. Parking a bit of a hassle as it is three hours only on the street during the day. We’re told we could park at the small mall next door but when we asked they said only when we were shopping there and the manager was fed up with the B&B telling people they could park there. They also lock the gate at 6 pm so if you haven’t moved your car you are out of luck.

Good location. Lovely deck to sit out and relax. Great breakfast.",positive

"Even though the breakfast is included, which is amazing, there's not a lot of variety.,

I was absolutely amazed by how the clean the bedrooms and particulary the bathrooms were. The shower is individual and inside a compartment with a washbasin, which allows us to have our privacy and take our belongings with us if we need to. Free lockers come with the room, which have very comfortable beds. You can walk from the hostel to the center of the city quickly. Extremely nice staff. I'm a total fan of this hostel and can't wait to be back.",positive

The dtay was fantastic. We also had a small bottle of champagne offered to us. Central, very comfortable, stylish.",positive

Very cute with a homey feeling but also elegant.,positive
"Nothing. The facilities were excellent, breakfast was more than adequate and the owners were helpful and accommodating which is all that is needed from a B&B. I would recommend this establishment.,

An excellent B&B in a good location with plenty of parking. In easy walking distance of the Grote Markt, Cloth Hall and Cathedral.",positive
"Would have loved a small fridge and tea/coffee facilities in the room and also a few more lights - room is a little on the dark side.,

Staff are super friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable about the area. Room was bigger than expected. Parking was easy and under cover. The bar area is lovely and over looks the canal - suspect this would be nice in summer!Located in a quiet location and easy walking to the main historic area (about 8 mins).",positive
"If I have to tell the cons there is hardly any. I feel at this category a bit bigger room would have been nice and may be we were lame to not figure out but the water from the bathtub doesn’t go out. Had to tell the reception but they took care of it. 
,

Location, Location and Location - Its fantastic. 2 min walk from the Grand Place. Mostly all attractions can be covered by foot. All within a radius of 10 mins. I was in room 505. Its called the kings room with a nice view.

Excellent hosts & lots of space,positive
"Nothing. Read all the booking.com comments and you have a good idea of what to expect.,

Basically, this is a typical 'previous-century' Brussels house in which individuals rooms have been converted to guest rooms. Price/quality is OK and probably one of the most fair in the district (where most hotel guests are not paying their own bills but using European tax money to pay much higher prices for rooms that are not much better). I have stayed in multiple hotels in this districts, single nights at the time, and this hotel is just fine. What you see in the website description is what you get. And no, there is no elevator...",negative
"rather noisy at night- but perhaps unavoidable in a city centre location,

very friendly helpful staff",positive
"Everything was very clean and easy to use! Great location, staff were really friendly too!",positive
"The only detail: the stairs lacked a barrier - it didn't feel very safe to walk down or up with a little kid.,

We had a very nice stay, appreciate every tiny detail that made us feel comfortable including design. We also benefited from some basic food (or hygiene) products that allowed us to had a tea and a lunch.",positive
Beautiful breakfast and beautiful host. Very friendly and made us feel at home,positive
Great location and very friendly staff. On site parking was a great bonus too.,positive
"We booked this apartment because it said in the facilities to have air conditioning. Due to the extreme heat during my visit this was definitely needed. However, upon arrival there was no airconditioning to be seen. In addition to that there was no toiletpaper and there were crumbs of potato chips left in de kitchen drawer. Apparently this was done on purpose “for me to enjoy” pardon my french but no thanks. I contacted the owner about the things which I mentioned in here but they didn’t respond until after I contacted the booking.com service department. Then I got an apology for the missing A/C, they took it off their facilities list, but the deed was done. They have mislead me to book this appartement. I was not compensated in anyway, this left me very disappointed. ,

The apartment is beautifully decorated. The location is in the middle of the city centre. Which is nice because everything is close except for the nearest free parking space, which was one kilometer away.",negative
"We did not get all the things as promised on booking.com specially related to WellnessRooms and kitchen was clean however when you lay on bed and see towards window in all rooms and bathroom you will see lot of mould at corners that kind of looks bad.Windows are mounted high, sometimes it's difficult to cover up: let's says when its sunny or you do not want light in the room.,

Ling is the Perfect Host !!! She is really Nice and helpfulLocation was perfect to spend quality time with familyMost of the amenities you need are present on site Homemade fresh Jams/juice/Croissant for breakfast Nice place to visit specially during summers as you get pool , kids can play outside, you can do barbeque and lot of other stuff...",positive
"I used to stay at cheaper hotels in higher quality and with better facilities. Okay, nothing against simplicity and a bit old-fashioned equipment, but in this case..I pay just for the location? I missed normal chair for sitting to the table and work, perfect was kettle etc., but just with tea...unfortunately without coffee ;-).,

Hotel is located near to the train station, very good accessible from the airport and near to the EU district. Clean bathroom and bed. Good for short-term stay if you do not stay in the hotel lot of the time. Very friendly staff.",negative

This B&B was in a very quiet location with free parking and only 5 minutes walk from the city centre.  Very friendly  hosts and we would definitely stay here again.,positive
"Tea and coffee in the room. Room facing the back and not the canal.,

Well located and small and cute inside. Very cosy and although very central was far enough from the hustle and bustle to enjoy the quiet. Lovely breakfast. Great staff and comfortable room. Would recommend the canal view though as the back of the building does not have good views. I would definitely stay again. Great value for money.",positive

"Modern hostel, not far from city center.",positive
"Kind of odd that there is no banister side of the staircase... As the floor was really cold even now, I can imagine that in winter the problem is really bad... Heating in otherwise is sufficient, but as mentioned, the floor itself is really cold.,

Absolutely fantastic place. We couldn't never expext this nice place. All stuff there what you could ever need in kitchen, tv, games and all. Loved the place!",positive
"Juliette’s B&B was very well situated in Yprès and very accessible on foot to the Cathedral, Cloth Hall, Flanders Museum, Menin Gate and all other places.  The house was charmingly decorated and very well appointed.  Our host was absolutely delightful and extremely helpful.  Breakfasts were delicious and beautifully laid out.  I would certainly like to return!",positive
"a little bit of a bigger bathroom which was ok for a short stay but too small for a longer stay..did think the inside of the Hotel a little dark but think a brighter wall paper or paint would make a lot of difference,

breakfast was continental which was good and had plenty of choice....asked for a canal view which we did get though was spoilt only by the weather..location was in walking distance of plenty of things to see and do",positive

The front desk staff, we didn’t get the names, but a blond woman and a man with glasses during the night, were really the best! They answered to all of our questions (so helpful) are were really the best ones! Thank you guys, to you and the whole hotel staff for making our weekend so enjoyable ❤️",positive
"I guess towels could be provided to the guest for free, missed tissues in the bathrooms, didn't love the fact that you need to make yourself the bed...but nothing overly important,

"There needs to be a little bedroom furniture.  It was not a great problem for us as we only stayed one night but if you were staying longer it could be annoying,

Staff were excellent, really helpfull.  Carparking was on site - quite a rarity in Bruges. Room was spacious but no drawers, bedside tables or wardrobe! hense the scoring down (there was a rail for clothes).  Breakfast was great and the ambiance of the hotel was good.

Overall the hostel was really homely and cosy! The staff was really helpful and friendly, helped out with any problems we had. I really liked the beds, the lockers with keypads were a great idea for those like me who keep losing the key:D Breakfast was simple, but I found it really nice. I liked the facilities, the kitchen is absolutely great. Definitely one of the best hostels I've ever stayed at, if not the very best!",positive
"Unfortunately it was raining most of the weekend, but this made the cottage an even nicer place to retreat.,

A lovely little cottage, which is actually surprisingly large for two people. The host Evelyn lives next doors and gave us a warm welcome in the cottage. The interior of the cottage also reflects the hospitality of the host, with nice decorations, a well equipped kitchen, and several extra things for a relaxing day (from hiking maps, DVDs, and books to a blanket for on the sofa).",positive

The staff. The location. The breakfast. The preserved wooden staircase.",positive
Alles was super!,positive
Great friendly service.,positive

"The water temperature from the shower was really hard to control.
If you are a light sleeper, it could be hard because you can hear what's happening outside (luckily I am not so it really didn't bother me at all).,

Very very well placed! We visited almost everything by walk.
Very clean and nice shower products!",positive

The room was spacious, stylish and very comfortable. With a balcon to let the champagne cool.",positive
"Being a 3 star property, the New Regina is a great value for the money. Located literally on the Main Square, the main city attractions are at your immediate disposal. The room was ready before 3 pm (official check in time), we found it very handy. The room was of an adequate size, I need to point out the large, extremely comfortable bed, Nice bathroom with rain shower. large towel selection. Coffee and tea making facility with choice of tea, regular coffee, decaf and cream. The breakfast was included in the room rate and it was the biggest surprise. Let me elaborate, as a frequent traveler for business and leisure, I've accumulated lots of experience BUT such a luxurious breakfast experience I don't remember. Great choice, variety of the items from cheese, ham, various jams, sweet spreads, butter, eggs, bread rolls and various viennoiseries... Quantity wise, it was more than enough for 2 people. Last but not least, very friendly staff ready to help you at any moment. I also want to mention pre-stay phase, I called the hotel several times and always being treated professionally and in a friendly manner.",positive
"Quite basic facilities,

Location was great.",negative

The location was the best about this hotel and the room size was good and the staff was helpful. Also the cafe downstairs and the bakery was very nice and good quality for the value of the money.",positive
"The showers are not great. They have a tiny stream of water and you have to push the button every 30 seconds. It's so frustrating and makes it hard to get clean or especially to wash hair. Also 2 showers for a whole floor is not enough. 
Suggestion: better shower heads. 
Suggestion #2: install mirrors in the dorms to help bathroom rush hour in the mornings ,

Everything else was fantastic. Relaxed and welcoming vibe, great bar space with good beers, kitchen with everything. 
The dorm was really good. Lovely big locker for suitcase, backpack, shelves to unpack and organise a little, a table in the room. decor was modern and fresh!",positive

"Not really a complaint - but walking up the stairs you feel guilty that you are a little noisy...,

"Restaurant service very slow.Street noise from 0300 for an hour was disturbing,

Town centre location with private and very secure parking. Fantastic modern rooms",positive
"Slept really well - quiet, dark room and a comfy bed. Great shower too - spacious, hot and powerful. Covid restrictions meant breakfast was delivered outside our door so we could choose ourselves when to eat. A very generous parcel of food with bread, ham, cheese, eggs, croissants and more!",positive
"Bathroom was rather small and narrow. There was an imitation of door, but not the real door.,

The location is fine. Our plane was delayed for more than two hours so we came after 1 am and the receptionist patiently waited for us. Merci beaucoup🙌",positive

"We were traveling to explore family roots.  Le Florentin was so charming and so delightful, just amazing in this small peaceful part of Belgium.  Dining at Le Florentin was superb!!  Breakfast was the best of our travels.  We were able to explore the city a bit (inspite of jet lag) and loved the beautiful hotel garden and surrounds.  Excellent!!",positive
Fantastic location right in the Grote Markt. Modern rooms. Even the breakfast delivered to your door (due to COVID) was good.,positive
"The building was old and the room and the bed were not comfortable. There was some dust on the walls. There was not hot tap in the washbasin. There was not  elevator and the stairs were not standard. ,

The staff were friendly and the location was good.",negative
"The only issue was a street noise on the street as the room was at street level and therefore it was impossible to use the room without curtains because without curtains you could see people walking by your bed.,

Location is perfect, only a short walk from Centraal train station. Internet speed was good and the staff was friendly.  Actually the location is also good when you like to walk 35 minutes to the Commission buildings - they are only 2,4 km away (you can also use public transportation, then it takes about 20 minutes).",negative
"Overall, a very nice, high-quality hostel. Facilities are comfortable and very spacious. Free lockers are provided in the room, which is a convenient solution. The breakfast was quite simple, but it’s great that there is one and it’s included in the price already. The hostel also has a bar with reasonable prices and friendly bartenders. The location is especially great: in a nice central area, but at the same time not in a street busy with tourists. Recommended!",positive
Juliette and Chris were the most obliging and warm hosts. The breakfast provided was generous and the room really comfortable. The location is walking distance to the Menin Gate.,positive
"Lovely Hotel, very stylish and perfectly located.",positive
Restaurant and staff,positive
"On the main square thre is a LCD screen that is little bit too much, so you need to keep curtains closed. But it depends on the room. If you dont mind this the view is great.,

Excellent location, parking was available on the main square (free because of the Covid). Staff very friendly with good informations. Breakfast was good served in the room. I think that breakfast will be even better if there is no COVID restrictions.",positive
"- noise , until 1 pm, from a nearby disco- mosquito, due to the owners having left the windows opened in the evening- it's modest, but that's ok for the price category in that area (considering the discount, without the discount it I would have found a better deal in another part of the city),

"Everything was perfect.,

Le Florentin exceeded my expectations in every way.  The hotel and restaurant staff were so kind and helpful throughout my entire stay.  I highly recommend making a reservation at the restaurant prior to arriving--I enjoyed one of the best meals I have ever had and witnessed several people turned away because every table was booked.  Even though I didn't explore the city, there were numerous shops and restaurants in the immediate area.  I hope to visit again.",positive
"A small table to write at would have been welcome.,

The reception was exceptional. Not being able to travel back to London for Rememberance Sunday, I could not think of a more welcoming place in this town that is usually full of Common Wealth citizens at that time of the year.",positive

Very nice staff, ready to help. Good location, easy chek in on the reception till midnight. Everyday cleaning, clean bad linen.",negative
"The entrance foyer is rather off putting and does not do justice to the rest of the hotel,

Wonderful location convenient for the central station, sightseeing and shopping.",positive
"I think the bathrooms were not enough for the number of rooms and people. Sometimes in the morning you have to wait for the shower. toilets are next to each other women men, not separated. Was a bit far from station, but nice walk to see Bruges,

The place was modern, clean and nice atmosphere. Clean bedroom, very warm. The shower was separated from toilets, you could look door and have hairdryer. The best thing was the breakfast! and the huge lookers with a code, where we could storage our 2 big bags and all stuffs (plus they have same lookers when you need extra time in the city after check out). Feel safe and they have cameras everywhere. Comfortable beds, big kitchen and lunge. Plus the bar is a good option to have an original beer from Blegium, good prices! Would go back!!! Wish every hostel was like this. They care about costumers",positive
"Minor quibbles. The breakfast was nice enough but nothing special.  There was a light on our landing which came on automatically when you crossed it at night which we found a little off-putting.  Similarly on the stairs leading up to the apartment, there was an automated light, but it often went off before you had managed to get your key in the door.,

A nice place, located around ten minutes walk away from the main square, restaurants etc.  The hosts were very pleasant and helped us with directions and the rooms were good, although one was perhaps a little tired.  We had the two bedroom apartment on the top floor and it was plenty spacious enough, with a good bathroom and comfortable beds and a good amount of natural light. We both had a good night's sleep on the evenings we were there.",positive

"The place feels a bit ""cold"", there are NO art works on the walls. Feel a bit like a (nice) hospital.The breakfast was OK but a bit too industrial (no local or fresh products like real yoghurt, local cheeses, good bread, fresh orange juice ...). I would pay more for a better (artisanal) breakfast.,

Good location, friendly staff. The beds are awesome !",positive
"Maybe don't stay in room 13! Was not the cleanest room, mattress did not quite fit the bed, furniture and fittings were very worn. curtains very thin and also did not quite cover the window, so did not block out the flashing light form the kebab house opposite - this did thankfully stop flashing at about 11pm, though this was only on a Tuesday night.,

Handy location for parliament and surroundings, good size room. Decent powerful shower (though there was no holder for it), nice old building with high ceilings and pleasant staff.",negative
Everything!,positive
Perfect!,positive
"Nothing major but perhaps for people who are staying for a number of nights a carton of milk in the fridge would be useful for a cup of tea or coffee rather than creamer.,

The staff were excellent. They were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Any time we interacted with them we felt valued. At breakfast they always had time for us and catered for our needs. The location is superb and the room was spotlessly clean with all the facilities we could ask for. Price was good and we had a dedicated place to park our car.",positive

That could accommodate 3 in 1 room,

The location is absolutely perfect, right on the square opposite the museums with plenty of places to eat and drink including the hotel restaurant.

"We were missing an air-conditioner, but luckily it wasn't that hot at the end of May.,

The breakfast was top of the top. Everything was very fresh. Prepared with the smallest details.I even discovered the best cheese in the world (damse mokke). If you close the curtains - it's completely dark (just how I like). If I would say that the owners are great - I wouldn't even say half of the truth (they are really friendly and super polite). Parking is free, the charging station for EV cars is within walking distance.",positive
"In the morning there was a cut off of electricity.
The showers had cold water, and the regulation of temperature was not possible, it was just a press button.
5€ deposit for the key, if you dont ask back for it they could forget it.,

Very nice location.
The hostel also has a pretty cool bar downstairs with pool.",negative
"Would be nice to be able to leave your suitcases somewhere for an early or late arrival, even for a fee. early arrival or late departure are expensive and this not being a hotel you cannot leave your suitcases and take advantage of your stay. The pillows are not great and a few more plates and cups would be appreciated.,

The location is perfect for visiting. Near all attraction plus near a supermarket and restaurants, stores. The apartment is spacious and has the essentials for a comfortable stay",negative
my stay was only a single night before flying home to Australia. the location was really great basically in the historic heart of the city and close to the central station making getting to the airport a breeze. It was easy to spend a couple of hours in the morning exploring the city before taking train to airport. the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was comfortable and clean.,positive
"We would have liked a little more information before our arrival or during the check-in process. We had to ask other guests the wifi password, and were not really sure which common areas we could use.,

The building is gorgeous and the interiors are very well designed. There are plenty of areas to hang out and the bed was really comfortable. The breakfast was great (tons of options and catered very well to my vegan companion). Netflix subscribtion was available on TV and they offer affordable bike rentals. Toiletries provided were also exquisite..",positive
"At around 3am while we were sleeping, a random guy came inside our room and immediately left after saying sorry. I think he was drunk/lost but it was upsetting and scary because we made sure to close the door but we didn’t double lock it as it can only be opened thru an electronic key card so we were confident no one can open our room except us and the hotel management. ,

The hostel is in the city center, nice and accommodating receptionist. Room was okay for 2 people.",negative
"I had two minor inconveniences during my stay: the dishwasher was not working and it was not possible to fix it during my stay.There was no door on the shower stall (I think it's like this by design) and I had to buy a mop to dry the bathroom floor.Regardless of the minor inconveniences, I am going to use a smartflats apartment again if the opportunity arises.,

Good place where to relax after a day of work during the Corona time.The apartment is placed in the middle of the city: daily necessities are very close by and there are quite a few parking garages to choose from (they have to be paid separately).",negative
"Amazing location, right in the centre! Easy walk to everything",positive
"We couldn't manage to switch on the wifi with the password given, but it might've been a default in our phone settings + we sort of enjoyed being disconnected too ;),

- The beautiful setting: a cool warehouse-tuned-luxury b&b, with the afternoon sun hitting the cosy bench right in front of the door...  The surroundings are quiet, in a residential area close to the canal right outside the historic city centre.- The large bed and comfy mattress.- The location: we loved biking into Bruges in 10 min or so, a great way to explore a city we love, because you see so much more.- The tips for take away, and the fact we could use the kitchen to heat it up. Must-try & a great tip from host Zoë: hamburgers from BABU, by top chef Gert De Mangeleer!-The great breakfast: delicious cheese, buns, croissants, and the home made jam, chocolate spread, little easter egg... beautifully decorated too, with elegant ceramics and personalised espresso cups.",positive

"The walls are thin, we did hear a lot of what was going on next door, but it’s a converted old building so not totally unexpected.,

Quiet location right by a canal yet very central. Room was comfortable but could do with a lick of paint in the near future. The overall vibe of the hotel is fabulous and we got excellent tips on places to eat etc. from the friendly and helpful guy who checked us in.",positive
"Too many people share one bathroom. No private bathroom for one room or dorm.,

The place is super close to the center and because of covid I got a 4 bed room to myself. The hostel manager(s) and other staff are extremely helpful. They let me check out late and helped me get in the hostel when I locked myself out. Definitely recommended.",positive

Beautifully appointed apartment close to the centre of town, with a great view from all rooms over the river to the castle. Although a small floor area, the apartment never felt cramped: the main bedroom is a good size and the lounge/kitchen is comfortable for a family. Logistics all very easy. Extremely clean. Free parking is available just down the road, and you can park free for 30 min in front to load/unload. Restaurants (when open), walking trails and gardens all within very easy reach.

Difficult to review Cathédrale as I was relocated to the En Neuvice flat after technical problems at the Cathédrale flat.But En Neuvice is nice as well and is well located in a vibrant, but still not too loud part of the city",positive
"The room i was given (room 112 or 113 i guess) was an aftermade room, it was so small, cold, air conditioning wasn't effective at all, window was an old type and i got cold during night. Price for that room was unacceptable.,

Breakfast was good and the bed was quite comfortable. Also it's located literally in the center of brussels.",positive

B room are built in a former brushes factory split over multiple businesses. Each has its own building but altogether creating a wonderful tiny secret and quite neighbourhood only 5 minutes away from historical centre of Bruges. B room is surrendered by a top class restaurant, and owner knows plenty of excellent addresses. He refurbished the whole place by himself to make it a wonderful loft in which five bedrooms are proposed. He is delighted to his visitors, breakfast he prepares is just amazing. Parking is free and located on the site. Bikes are also available. Overall, B room is the Best room.",positive

"Since our room was in the last building, the internet connection there was bad. Nearly useless. But the coverage in the lobby and other places were decent, however, speed was not great.,

Best Hostel I've ever been to so far. The cleanest, most comfortable and relaxed hostel I've ever been to. Our room was very big with just 4 beds. Other hostels put at least 12 beds in the same room. They cleaned rooms, corridors and everything, every day. The place even smelled good. The lockers in the room were so big, you could fit a human inside. With 3 shelves, 3-meter height, there is nothing you can't fit in. The locker room for storing your bags and suitcases after checking out was also free. No need for padlocks as all lockers has digital lock. Staff were super friendly, fluent in English and so helpful. Good breakfast included with cereals, cheese, bread, peanut butter, chocolate, milk, coffee, juice and oranges and apples. Very big kitchen with lots of kitchen appliances, 3 stoves and spices. The atmosphere in the bar/common area was so good. Every night live music. This is a place I will definitely go back to.",positive

Cold meats, fresh fruit, breads, pastries, cheeses, cereal and fresh coffee served in the dining room overlooking the canal.The small bar is also a delight and even has an outdoor terrace on the canal with lights in the trees at night!We really, really, really loved staying at Monsieur Ernest and wished we had chosen a longer stay in Brugge!",positive

En suite facilities have no door just a vanity screen. Room is on first floor access via open staircase at rear was not easy in howling gale and driving rain.,

Convenient location, bistro down the road for basic but very good food and excellent choice of beers. Room was warm, very important in February. Breakfast excellent and owner very friendly. Owner is an artist and has an abundance of her work on display.",negative

Spacious, clean, great location for sights and groceries from local store less than a block away. Lots of restaurants close too. Parked in park axe down the street first Eve and overnight ($24euros)but next nights stayed on street just in front and police walking by said it was ok as long as we left early (before 8). Not sure if that is ok but no tickets for us and was sooo convenient. LOVED this place. Wish weather had been nice enough to be on lovely patio.",positive

More soft furnishings would have warmed the place up a bit like a couple of fleecy blankets.  ,

Location,  friendly host.  Breakfast was very good. Parking was good. Interesting place to stay.  Bikes were available to tent at a very reasonable price.",positive
"The room has no door to the toilet given there is no hall area between the bed and the toilet so basically, the person in the room will ""enjoy"" all the pleasantries of another one being in the toilet! Particularly lovely for couples' romantic atmosphere. :((( the entrance to the studio is upstairs, not protected by any fence so at night it was particularly dangerous to walk up and down the stairs. Despite this, the owner strongly recommended to not let the outside lamp on as the light would have bothered someone on the ground floor; funny thing is that underneath the stairs there was just the owner's bathroom so not sure how the light could have bothered anyone unless she didn't sleep in the bath tub. The real reason was very simple - the owner tries to cut costs of absolutely everything! The second proof of this was no heating in the room, it basically stopped after 5 min of work as a thermostat was apparently set on 15 degrees. It was a cold night and the walls were very thin so I had to go downstairs to ask for a portable heater (was asked to not put it on maximum though). Pillows was very uncomfortable, we were lucky having our own ones with us.There were no toiletries (almost empty dispensers, half roll (!) of toilet paper.Please, don't count on breakfast at this premise! For 2 people we got 2 eggs, butter and lots of bread. My husband asked an orange juice but got an expired peach juice. He could have been easily poisoned. Again, the owner is extremely stingy and try to get max profit from the room booking. And the worst part of this stay is the owner's inappropriate comments. After I gave her place a good rate (despite all issues) she sent me a very rude email, see the prints teen attached.Terrible experience, I strongly recommend to stay away from this studio.",negative

"In a bit of busy location, but it was the height of summer. We had room 1 and the shower could do with a bit of TLC. The shower head would not stay up and it leaked in several places all over the bathroom floor. Had to use a towel to mop it up,

The host was wonderful, althoug hthe breakfast was additional it was very good. Rooms are well laid out and a good size.",positive
"The shared kitchen, but keep in mind that the accommodation is ""room only"" so you really get a lot of extras,

Very friendly and helpful owners, you book a family bedroom but what you actually get is the full house with exception to the shared kitchen. Value for money. Lovely garden, position for walking and exploring the region. Children liked the chickens, the little extra treats, Netflix. We were also forgiven a little incident with a broken object.",positive

We could use the kitchen with all the spices, pots, we had a fire place to chill around and the rooms were super spacious with comfy beds, super clean bathroom and amazing view to the river. Breakfast were so great and in the evening the lady even offered us to share their meal which was restaurant level lamb shoulder. Oh and not to forget the dessert - rice pudding with fresh fruit coulis and berries. We felt more than in heaven.I am afraid there is no better place for the money in ardennes...Definitely gonna come back there later in the summer to enjoy the sunny terrace!",positive
"The room was outdated and a bit rusted but didn’t affect my stay it simply doesn’t give you the feeling of hotel.The curtains was falling from the rods was hard to make it dark in the room at night. I wast able to increase to control the heat it was locket at a max I wanted it a little warmer because of my sinus. The washroom was ok but very old you can tell it is rusted need to be updated. There was a bit dust here and there and wear and tear on the walls and window. But those are really only details that some people that worked in the industry like myself would notice. My partner liked the room said was comfortable and clean.
We only spent a night on during holidays.I would say because of the location and because the bed seemed very clean and felt comfortable I think it is worthwhile. No fridge,No microwave,really thin pillow (didn’t bother asking for other type,maybe they had options).,

The location was excellent,the staff was friendly and welcoming. Check in was fast and efficient. The room had high ceilings made it feel very big. The room and bed was clean and comfortable. Bed had a decent size. It had a desk ,3-4 chairs,a Safe and some coffee,extra blanket, towels and some toiletries. No elevator.",positive

Our hosts were fantastic, breakfast good choice although we did our shopping as well in nearby grocery shop as we stayed 4 nights and wanted to try local foodWe could use the large kitchen anytime, so making a sandwich or eating our cake was easy, also coffee and tea were not restricted and we used the fridge to store what we boughtRoom #2 was clean, the bed comfy, overall good stayWe got clean towels daily, which we found a nice feature",positive

Mostly everything :)",positive
"There were not enough open plugs in easy to access places in the room. Soap is the only complimentary toiletry. Lugging (pulling, rolling, carrying, etc.) our suitcases up the steady slope to the Brussels Central train station through milling crowds of tourists etc. was not easy. Not a fault of the hotel, but of the square cobblestones in the area.,

Breakfast was adequate and delicious, but for stays of more than one day it might become a bit limited. Location was fabulous: Grand Palace right around the corner, the Museum of Fine Arts within easy walking distance, as are a few supermarkets and many chocolate shops. Staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke good English. They smoothly and safely kept our luggage for several hours after we checked out.",positive
"Only draw back for me was at 5ft tall it was a climb up and out of the high beds but it gave us a giggle 😂,

Fabulous base for exploring Bruges, taxi into square £10 euros or a nice walk about 30 mins just strolling. Very clean, modern  and well presented throughout, full continental breakfast with fresh coffee and Orange Juice, Peter was very friendly and accommodating, highly recommended 😊",positive
"The beds were not very comfortable, so nobody slept very well.,

All instruction manuals were so friendly in tone; it made us feel very welcome. We really enjoyed the hot tub. The host was very communicative in the lead up to our stay but gave us all the privacy we wanted whilst we were there though would have been readily available for any questions.",positive

Excellent bed,positive
"Shabby, no lift, no telephone, poor bed linen, poor lighting, no pop up plug in sink in first room offered (receptionist blamed maid!), poor curtains did not stop street lights, paint flaking off wall, television too small  and too far away; poor breakfast with only milk available being UHT full fat which apart from its unhealthy nature tastes horrible.

Nothing to like, would not recommend.",negative

Zoë packed 2 pieces of chocolate cake made by her mother for us to enjoy on the road — priceless souvenir!",positive

After a warm welcome we were presented with a very spacious room. There was very sufficient central heating and a nice bathroom with a stand alone modern shower cubicle. The bed was big and comfortable with a modern quilt but with rather flat pillows.
There's a separate little room where one can enjoy a coffee in case you don't opt for the breakfast as we did.
Unfortunately we didn't have the opportunity to communicate with the owner more as he seemed to be extremely friendly. He obviously takes great pride in his very well renovated house.",positive

André is really a special person! We have never stayed somewhere with such a kind and thoughtful proprietor. You see this both in the way he is with his guests and in every detail of the property. We had a lovely room with a very comfortable bed and big bathroom, as well as access to the living room, terrace, and even a small lounge room that had a mini-fridge where we could put our wine.

Unique place, a farmhouse plenty of astonishing details, immersed in the silence of the countryside and surrounded by a nice garden. Every corner of the house is a pleasant discovery of beauty. Not by chance it is runned by a talented artist with the support of her delightful husband. Both are so welcoming and charming people that is impossible to not feel at home. City center of Bruges only 5 minutes by car. This is the best place in Bruges where to spend an inspiring and relaxing holiday.",positive

"Charming cottage in La Concession district, at 100 m from the beach and the dunes. Very comfortable beds, spacious apartment, we had a whole floor just for us! Perfect for savoring the flavor of 'la belle epoque'.",positive
"A beautiful breakfast, lovely host, very good rooms. We all slept well on very comfy beds. There was a lovely garden as well as living room area that we were allowed to use.",positive

All ok ...",positive

It's so nice to be in the city center! Also the staff gave us nice information about places to visit. Overall an ideal place for short stays!,positive
"No complaints whatsoever.  We will return.  We would recommend Hotel New Regina to anyone.,

Beautifully clean, comfortable bed, great location, peaceful at night, fantastic breakfast, very friendly staff.  Plenty of hot water.  We would definitely return.  The location, directly opposite the Cloth Hall and museums, is spectacular.  A great place for a base for WW1 sights and visits.  200m from the Menin gate.  Friendly family-run hotel with staff who care.  Secure, heated underground parking 5 min walk away.",positive
Everything,positive
"Welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable staff whose enthusiasm was very much appreciated. Great location, comfy beds and lovely breakfasts!",positive
"There was no sink in the bathroom. The sink was in the accomodation room. The breakfast was a bit simple,

Good pizza, nice staff and excellent location. I didn't hear much noise but I didn't travel during season.",negative
"- No essential Room Facilities: No toilet spicemens, No slipper, No refrigerator, No kettle
- Very Poor Breakfast: Cost is high in comparison with room size and other nearby hotels,

The staff are friendly
The location is very good, it is located in the center near the Grand Place",positive
"I went B.room with my husband for a couple days. It was the best bed & breakfast experienced we’ve ever had. Location is great, owner of the hotel is great, breakfast is great! totally recommend!",positive
"There was nothing we didn’t like, this place exceeded our expectations and we would come back to stay here again!,

The place was perfect! The room we stayed in was very comfortable , with a nice en-suite bathroom. The decoration at the whole hotel is quite old-stylish, which we really enjoyed. Check-in was done very smoothly and contactless. The breakfast was delicious and the service was amazing.  The hotel is right at the beautiful beach and only a few minutes walk away from cafes and restaurants. 100% recommend !",positive
"Be aware that the toilet is accessed through one of the bedrooms.,

The family room we booked turned out to be two big bedrooms with 2 double beds, a single bed and a cot. There was also a small room with fridge, coffee & tea makers etc. We had access to a lovely terrace and a garden. It was peaceful for a real bargain for accomodation in the Ardennes.",positive
"The facility is very old and uncared. The room we provided was decorated with dirty and inelaborate staff. Toilet and bathroom was a mess. Toilet was leaking dirty water when you use it and there was no hot-water in the morning.,

Especially for parlamentarians, as the name implies, who deserve good-looking but nothing-inside things.",negative
"The place was not safe, doors cannot be closed properly. There is no shower box or bath tab in the bathroom, you have to sit in order to have a bath. The stairs to the 2nd level is not safe for kids, and there is no warning sign that you might hit your head while you are on the stairs because its low.I booked it for 9 nights and checked out after the 1st night. They even didn't refund my money for the rest of nights. Which was really very bad. Other places will charge you for the 1st two nights and refund you money back for the rest. But here I lost all my money.I would not recommend this place at all especially if you have kids.",negative
"Overall a great experience. Big, clean cozy beds, spacious rooms, plus they play great music in the reception area, where they also have a little bar. I would definitely return.",positive
"There was nothing we didn't like about this property, its location or its staff,

Rooms were fantastic. Very clean and modern. Location was perfect",positive
"personal light and power socket @ur bed, good location, tasty breakfast",positive
"The only one down comment is take ear plugs,for whilst a very quiet hotel, the bathroom extractor fan whirred all night.I'm sure the very helpful staff would have done something about it,but because we had earplugs we didn't find it a problem.,

This small boutique hotel is perfect for a short city break.Its location is a stone throw from all main sights and shopping locations yet within a quiet residential area overlooking a charming branch of the main canals.The staff were the friendliest hotel staff we have ever encountered.The lady receptionist who welcomed us on arrival on the 30th April was charming and the male receptionist [Nicholas] ,was enthusiastic to  100%.The distance from the main rail station is a short taxi ride [E12 euros] and easily walkable with small luggage cases.The breakfast was plentiful but continental.The monochrome decor may not be to everyone's taste but we found it relaxing.",positive
"Bedroom was old
Bathrooms were a bit smelly
No towels available
Poor breakfast

Breakfast was very nice. Regional and less waste. Peter is a wonderful host. The rental bikes are fantastic to exolore the City. Highly recommend this b&b,positive
"No warm water at our floor (if you go there, avoid to stay at the 2nd floor of the B&B, no way to get a normal shower or warm bath !!). Breakfast finishes too early (9.30 !!). Pets are admitted in the B&B but not in the breakfast room ?!!!??? Walls are very thin ... the couple in our neighbor room had good time during the night.,

Great location, quiet environment, easy parking, nice breakfast",negative
"Perhaps a suggestion for the owner, for the summer season: mosquito nets in front of the windows.,

Nice, spacious room. Good bed. Kind host. Quiet little town.",positive
"If you have a problem with climbing stairs, take note that there is no lift. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing to dislike about this establishment.,

Perfect location within commutable & walking distance of all amenities and sights. Foudil welcomed us like long lost friends and couldn't have been more helpful. The room was clean and comfy with a lovely little bathroom.",positive
"We booked a family room (4 persons) for 5 nights, though stayed only for 3 nights. 
Firstly, we were greatly disappointed by the size and configuration of the bathroom. There is no shower and the small bath is fixed in the wall (making it impossible to stand up). Hence, washing oneself becomes a tricky challenge, especially for men of large complexity. 
Secondly, we were bothered by the smell in the room. Although it was clear that this B&B is located in an old farm house, it was still an unpleasant finding.
Thirdly, the B&B lacks stable wi-fi connection. 
Also, it should be noted that B&B is located close to an industrial area and a rather noisy highway.",negative
"Big, spacious, clean rooms. The staff was really helpful and friendly. Friday night karaoke was really cool. I recommend it.",positive
"The only thing that could let the property down would be that there is no on site parking.,

Location is brilliant right in the town square, clean basic hotel just what we needed for a weekend break.",positive
"WC was outside the room even though they said it had bathroom inside, no towels and shower has temporizer, no soap or shampoo in the room. ,

Breakfast was good.",negative
"Breakfast was good but under cooked eggs were a bit concerning I would recommend a small egg boiler to cook eggs to order to ensure safe to eat But did not affect our stay.The room was lovely but lacking a draw and bedside tables would be great as had to use the desk stool but bedside tables with drawers would benefit future guests.Also mirror on bathroom door would be better on outside as a bit warm to use whilst in a warm bathroom but nothing spoilt our stay...,

Loved the decorThe bed was sooo comfortableNicolas was so helpful on our arrival and first evening he couldn’t have done more to make our first night perfect.",positive
"That it does not have Signals for the rooms or storage luggage , and it is a little bit complicated to find them ,

The bar is awesome and the location",positive
The location was perfect only about a 2 minute walk to the grand place the centre of Brussels and 5 minutes to central train station. The breakfast was good as well.,positive
Interesting architecture & very friendly owner. Bike hire fantastic value for money. Wonderful restaurant next door but one.,positive

Great location, wonderful breakfast and friendly staff",negative
"When I booked I asked for no stairs ie lift available or room on lower floor but only found out week before that my room on 2nd floor and it was 6 flights of stairs.  The staff were wonderful in carrying my suitcase but nevertheless it was hard for me to manage that many stairs,

The staff particularly reception were very helpful",negative

"wery, wery central :)",negative
"Didn’t love our bathroom it was big but the shower/bath needed to be clean better and the shower curtain I didn’t like. Pillows were also not comfortable. ,

The location of Aris Grand Place Hotel is prefect right in the right of the city. Easy to get to by public transport and lots of restaurants around. Room was a good size and we were facing the ally and we couldn’t hear anything. Breakfast was good.",positive
"Zero,

We read the comments before coming to Brugge so expectations were high, but they were more than met. Extraordinary interior which (in our opinion) is a perfect contrast to the old city center of Brugge. Peter is the perfect host. Lovely breakfast.",positive
"Decoration, space",negative
"Run down room,

Nice location",positive
"Just A little bit far from the center.,

It is the best hostel in Brugge. Workers are really respectful & polite. Building’s design is unbeliaveble! 
Rooms look like designed by IKEA!",positive
Easy check in comfortable rooms helpful staff good food.,positive
Decent buffet breakfast in the morning. Free luggage storage before check-in and also after check-out.,positive
"The hotel was very clean...continental breakfast had a choice....location was excellent..very quiet.
All in all value good value for money.",positive

It is just where all the attractions are.",positive

"You don't get towels, I didn't remember it was mentioned on my booking. We get back to ask for them and the reception was closed because it was probably after the hours.,

Location is in the center of Brussels, really close to the Grand Place. Room was really quiet. Place and facilities are definitely clean.",negative
Very nice hotel with cordial owners. We felt very welcomed and had a great time. Rooms are spacious and thoughtfully renovated. Tasteful interior décor. Pleasant breakfast & bar area. Appetizing breakfast buffet & good drinks. Parking in the courtyard. Easy check-in & check-out.,positive
"Simple but nice, clean rooms and veda. Personal was friendly and attentive. Very good location.",positive
"The only downfall if there is one is that a taxi cannot stop at the front door.,

The location of this hotel is he best for trains and local sightseeing. Bonus - local tour shop next door. Fantastic restaurants on door step. Would definitely recommend a stay here..",positive
"The bathroom was very clean and modern but did not have many toiletries (only basic handsoap and handcreme). Luckily we had our own soaps and shampoos/conditioners but a few more toiletries would have been nice :),

The building is extremely unique, clean, modern amenities, and well-maintained. The breakfast was excellent with several choices and particularly healthy choices (meats, yogurt, fruits, pancakes, coffee - our host even made his own gravlax that was very tasty!). Peter, our host, was extremely friendly and talkative. We had many great conversations over breakfast and he made our stay that much better! The bike rental available on site was very helpful to get into the old Bruges city and there is free parking for vehicles on-site.",positive
"The hotel looks old but it gave me the feeling of living in a little worn down apartment than a hotel. So it was not really a problem for me. There was no cupboard in the room to keep your stuff.,

The room was clean, staff were friendly and the location is very close to the centre.",positive
"a little far from trainstation,

good location. perfect roommates. clean and safe. offering free city tour.",positive

Great location, good bar area downstairs",positive
"My friends room was very nice and cool, but ours was hot and the AC did not work, we opened the windows which made it plenty cool enough, but the street was so loud at night that it kept us up. That is the only compliant the rest was really amazing. We loved the room so much, we did not report it for fear they would move us and we would lose our perfect view. So we are to blame on  that.,

A beautiful view, polite staff and a great breakfast. Very easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go, in the center of it all, very near Grand Place.",positive
"I had not realised there was no lift, although it was not a huge problem for me. The bathroom was clean, but needed attention, water was spraying in all directions from the tap at the sink. The curtains in the room were hanging by only half the hooks (at both windows), which meant it was not possible to keep out the bright lights from Hotel Renaissance opposite. Inside the room, there were only very sleepy bulbs in the lamp in the ceiling, and no light at all at the desk,  so early night! Which was just as well, because noisy roadworks started before 7 am the next day, although that is not the hotel's fault, of course!,

The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet at night, the heating worked and the location was good for me. Staff was very helpful, offering to carry my bag up the stairs.The hotel serves breakfast at a reasonable (extra) price and also serves lunch, which seemed to be popular.",negative
"The rooms and the lockers are really big. The bathrooms are clean and accesible to people in wheelchairs, that was really awesome and surprising. I totally recommed it :)",positive

"The staff went out of there way to accommodate me. I will be back ,

The water pressure was amazing, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the windows were sound proof. It was set right in the middle of everything.",positive
The bed was too soft and the environment very noisy at night although I kept the windows shut.,negative
"I had a few snoring people like a lawnmower on our dorm so I couldn't really sleep that night. In the morning they were talking out loud while I was trying to get some rest. Of course Snuffel can't do anything about it, so I don't blame them :) ,

The location is just perfect! It's near the center, near a night shop and near good cafés (visit 't Poatersgat!)",positive
"All was good ,

Fantastic location, lovely staff and lovely room.",positive

Amazing decor and fantastic location. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. Couldn’t have asked for a better level of service. Good selection of breakfast foods.",positive
"The hotel is a very bad choice given the price they charge and compared to other hotels in the same area. Interior is in bad shape, no wardrobe, dresser full with towels and no space for own clothes. The bathroom is run down and with broken door and sink. Cheap and carelessly chosen furnishing. No wonder one has to pay in advance before seeing the room. Clear recommendation to stay away!,

Big bedroom Comfortable beds Good breakfast",positive
"Excellent location, and comfortable warm room. Loved looking outside onto the market square.",positive
"The room looked clean at first (I checked in at night and the lights in the room were quite soft), but in the morning the lack of attention to detail became evident. In my specific case there were human hair attached to the walls of the bathroom, and pencil drawings on the walls. I don't much care for the container-type bathroom, which worked well in itself, despite clear signs of wear and tear.,

Location is good.",negative
"The showers in the bathroom don't work well. You have to push the button at least 20 times while having a shower. Also flowing water was not enough,,

The room was very well designed, cozy and clean. Also you have an electrical outlet near your bed.The keypad of the closet was very useful and secured.",positive
Staff location could not be better breakfast very good,positive

"Came back to the room one afternoon to find that the maid had left our door lying wide open. No sign of them in the corridors so they had clearly made the room up then forgot to close the door. Thankfully all valuables were in the safe.,

Amazing location just one street behind Grand Place. Clean rooms, sturdy beds and a nice powerful shower. Staff were friendly.",positive
"There was nothing at all that we didn't like.  Everything met our expectations!,

We arrived before 8pm on the evening of our reservation and was greeted by Hilde (owner) herself. She explained to us everything we needed to know about the home, even the restaurant and the exceptional German wines they have on offer.",positive

One of stairs is quite steep, so something to consider if you have issues with stairs.,

Great location (easy to find). Effecient friendly staff and reasonable price",positive
I liked the fact that it was family run,positive

A real good, inspiring place. Just perfect and nothing else. Arthur is an extraordinary host.",positive
"Wardrobe needed replacing.
Toilet had a small but constant leak.
,

It is very, very conveniently situated near central rail station.",positive
"Shower is a bit weird but ok :)Breakfast could be much better - better if you can include some meat too,

Basically in the center of the city - I recommend this hostel if you want to make short 1 day trips to Brugge or Gent as it's very close to Brussel Central train station.Friendly staff, good bar with a wide variety of beers.Extra points for the bartender ;).Cozy spaces for chill, small lounges at every floor and a big one near the reception",positive
Perfect view,positive
"All was to our liking, Maybe only one extra toilette on 2nd floor would have been great.,

Loved EVERYTHING! The place is great, beautifully serene, quite, green, lovely. The house itself is great, nice decoration. The host is very helpful and nice. We loved our stay, and can't wait to go back. I strongly recommend it.",positive
"My head hit the bar several times in the penthouse.,

The room for young artist",positive
"We had an incident with one of the receptionists. He was a tall white guy. Even though his shift had ended and he was leaving, he made it his business to harass us while we were trying to get some hot water and a spoon for the tea that we brought outselves. Instead of trying to help, he made us feel most unwelcome, he treated us like we were about to rob the place. His remarks and attitude were very condescending. Thankfully the other receptionist was present while this happened and apologized on his behalf. He helped us get what we need. The other staff was great too.",positive
"great position, close to Gare Central and Gare du Midi. really comfortable.",positive
"Cold tiled floor in living room but gets ok after some time with the stove.,

The pellets stove. Window powered blinds. The views to the countryside. Great internet connection.",positive
"The room was stifling hot the first night, but thankfully the staff fixed it on the second day because it was really uncomfortable. There was no soap in the shared bathroom. The bar's restaurant closed at 6:30 so we never got to take advantage of all the perks they offer.,

Staff were great. Bar is fun. Italian restaurant next door is delicious. Location is perfect for exploring Bruges. Close to the action but still quiet enough for a good night's sleep.",positive
"We were woken up by tractors at 6am going along the field at the back of the property which was fine for us as we were leaving at 6.30. Would only happen certain times of the year. ,

Lovely big room and bathroom, very modern facilities, looking out over the garden, huge comfortable bed, separate entrance for guests so could come and go as we pleased. Walked into town for beers and a Thai meal and strolled back in the semi darkness, about 15 min flat walk. Compared to the ibis budget in town which was more expensive and very very basic, it was excellent value.",positive
"Getting suitcase up stairs would have been a bit challenging if I'd been alone but I would imagine that would be the case with a lot of places.,

Wonderful little balconyQuiet area at nightWell equippedseparate toilet to bathroom Arthur wonderful host...easy to contact and communication excellent",positive

The room is spacious and nicely done up. The hotel is well located as it is near the train station and close to attractions.",positive

The room is clean, all facilities are great. Good value for money",positive
"The only issue was the weather, with it being a blisteringly hot week (over 40 degrees) it was difficult to get to sleep at night. The option of lighter bedding would have helped.,

Location is perfect for anyone attending events at the Spa Francorchamps Circuit, which is a 15 minute walk from the chalet. The chalet itself is located in a quiet area of the village, within a large grounds which makes the area private.",positive
"It was a bar with loud music ... So, a bit noisy at night,

A bit cheap.... Since it's Bruges",negative
"Provision of more kichenetts like toaster, freezer compartment in fridge etc would have been better.,

Location in greenary.Comfortable stay. Helpful host.",positive
All our dreams were realized. Best host I ever seen. Everything was perfect.,positive

The best is the staff working there, super friendly and helpful. Location is excellent. Airco also good. Quite comfortable hotel.",positive

Good location, friendly staff. I was here allready in summer time and it was nice to come back.",positive

Perfect location in Antwerp and a very stylish apartment. Felt like home. The host Arthur was very welcoming and gave us many great tips.,positive
"In some conditions not being able to reach the hotel (pedestrian zone) with public transports is a bit limiting.,

In the very heart of Brussels, fair value for price and nice staff. It's just behind the Grand Place but it is not so noisy.",positive

Everything ok,positive

The location was really nice, i liked the environment, next to the track, the house was amazingly nice and clean. Loved it.",positive
"Not really a hostel more like a B&B, no kitchen facilities at all(no fridge, microwave, hob, etc) no comunal place. It's  bar and restaurant with rooms to rent. Bar until 4:00 and rooms on top. ,

Great location and the bar it's great, clean place",positive

We loved the location of the flat and the decoration and also the fact that it has  a lovely terrasse and the owner is really nice.",positive
"Nothing really.. 
It's a no frills but perfectly lovely little hotel
I guess tea facilities would be nice but I wouldn't expect that in a 3 star hotel necessarily,

Location was great
Staff all lovely 
Rooms and beds comfy
Clean with good service 
Noise outside was minimal 
Stylish lounge 
Good breakfast 
Would definitely recommend",positive
Great suggestions of places to eat from Nicolas! He was really helpful and made our Bruges experience fantastic and one to remember!,positive

Quality of the breakfast should be better....,positive
Fabulous location surrounded by beautiful countryside,positive
"I had booked a separate twin room, which had sticky floors (assuming whatever they use for cleaning), the room was boiling all night (yes, I tried to switch off the heating) and one of the bed linen was dirty. The staff wasn't rude but I didn't find them very friendly either. Breakfast was very basic, bread and boiled eggs.,

Location of the hostel is great and so is their bar with pool and gaming facilities. The mattresses were comfortable.",negative
"Had a kitchen but no oven. There are no towels provided by the hotel that I saw. Luckily, I read about it prior to booking so I knew to bring my own towels. Stair to the loft is bit steep so be careful if you have young ones.,

The location was only 10 minutes to where we needed to be at so that was good. Restaurants and grocery stores (Aldi) was about 10 minutes drive. There is a restaurant on premises but we did not eat there so can't really give it a recommendation. There is also a wine store attached to the hotel. The room (whole apartment) was spacious for a family of four. Parking lot was good. Go-karts were a great addition!",positive
Perfect cosy and stylish accomodation and excellent host!,positive

Very friendly owner. Small room to the garden but with all facilities. Water kettle, lamps where you need them. Very good price for Brussels. Room small but functional and even cosy. Nice guest lounge on ground floor.",positive
"Noise and loud music until 2am, also festival could ally of problems with driving and parking.,

Spacious room and very good breakfast also located on the square.",positive
"Rooms are old, no conditioner, bathroom sinks were both stuck, water didn’t go at all. Construction of the floor is bumpy. Price for the room should be way cheaper.,

Location is perfect, very close to the sea, stuff was very kind. Restaurant is beautiful, breakfast is good",negative
"Showers and bathrooms are not convenient. The showers smell. The place could do with a few decorative touches and homey feel can be added to enhance stays. You had to make your own bed. ,

The price was good for an included breakfast. The location is very good and beautiful. The beds are nice. It feels safe for a solo traveler",positive
"Despite the personalization,  they have make a SERIOUS,  MAJOR mistake...  I booked a bed in a 4 bedded FEMALE ONLY dorm only to find out the next morning that my room mate was a GUY.  Thank God nothing happen to me that night.  It's not about the MONEY here.. It's about the safety of your clients!  If i don't mind sharing a room with a guy,  i would book a mixed dorm.  Because I don't feel comfortable and safe,  i booked a bed in a FEMALE ONLY dorm...  So this kind of error is totally unacceptable.  I don't feel safe and I feel like the property x bother about my safety issue even after I complaint at the reception.,

The hostel pays attention to my specific request.  I requested for a lower bed.  They print out a paper reserving my bed in the room.. Which makes me feel personalized.",positive
Everything brilliant,positive
"Staff could be more friendly,

Great value for money",positive
"The house was wonderful and clean!  The only items that we that needed to be cleaned before used were the dishes.  They seemed to have some dirt/dust residue on them.  The sound proofing is also a little soft and I have a toddler so I'm sure the neighbors didn't love us.  ,

Perfect location for traveling from the coast to Brussels over 4 days.  Beautiful and modern farm with sheep, horses, and cows viewable in neighboring fields.  Easy to find, park, communicate with the host, and even a great place for my toddler to play in an outdoor play home and bikes to ride.  Fully equipped kitchen (no stove) and a lovely large bathroom with walk in shower.  The beds are very comfortable and the furniture is nice as well. We would stay here again!",positive
"The stair access was a little daunting but part of the adventure when staying at some European apartments. ,

Location, decor and facilities in the apartment.  Outstanding property!!",positive
"On Saturday  I came to the Breakfast area quite late on and I could not find a clean table for breakfast, also some of the food was no longer available. I did complain about this and in fairness they deducted the cost of my breakfast from my room rate. This Monday morning all was good, tables all cleared and plenty of food available,

It is in a great location for the centre of Brussels. Staff were friendly and the room very clean and comfortable",positive
"Unfortunately as many reviews say, there aren’t any coffee/tea facilities in the room... but with this hotel, this is just something to say as a downside because there really aren’t any! ,

This was our fourth time in Bruges and a really good hotel stay!! The staff is very friendly and extremely welcoming, also helpful as well! The rooms were bigger than most in Bruges and the bed was very comfortable. There is an elevator for those who can’t take the stairs or don’t want to trek with the luggage up to the room. The bathroom is a nice size with a great shower. There is a shoe cleaner downstairs by the check-in desk. The breakfast was okay—there were only breads, cold meats, cheeses, yogurt ( European breakfast). You can leave your bags for the day at check-out just in case you want to leave for a few hours sans luggage. Definitely will be returning to this hotel!",positive
"The room was very spacious and clean, with a great bed and bathroom. Our hosts were also very nice and welcoming, we had a lovely time here and would stay here again if we're in the area.",positive
"Lovely warm welcome by friendly people. 25 minutes walk from Parliament buildings. Clean, straightforward room. What more could you possibly want:)",positive
"Nobody at reception it took an age to get someone we were a little early but were left under no illusions as when check in time is also not a secure place to leave your luggage also the garage is quite a bit away ,

Clean spacious rooms",positive
location is perfect.,positive
"Only 2 toilets per flat,

Really nice breakfast and its location is really good!",positive
"No cooking oil, which is a very cheap fix but a critical one indeed.  This can be a bit of a hinderance if one's coming in late at night.  The local Butcher is open on Sundays, fortunately, and I picked up a steak, various cold cuts and Olives, Antipasto, etc.   Got a bit stuck when unable to cook due to no oil/butter. The owner/hoast brought the butter promptly but since she only speaks French (*very* little English), communication was difficult. On day 2, I used Google translate which was a lot better to communicate.   ANOTHER issue is the funky heater/Fireplace which burns pellets.  The instructions are non-existent and the explanation by the owner is in French.   What she needs to do is create ENGLISH instructions for the fireplace/heater.  Putting it on/off a few times results in heater damage (which is what happened) and the owner gave me a temporary electric heater.  That worked but was not half as charming!!,

Very nice ambience in the Chalet and good views of the surrounding forest.   Fully stocked kitchen (utensils, forks, knives, plates, etc. etc.) except that there was no cooking oil, so one was a bit stuck too cook stuff. Though the owner promptly brought butter as a substitute!",positive
"Bathrooms could be cleaner. There was also no handsoap in any of The toilets.,

Reading all the reviews we were expecting our room to be an absolute nightmare. It turned out to be decently clean and comfortable. Equipped with just the bare basics, a bed 2 chairs and a sink. The bedding was clean and the room did not feel too dirty although it could certainly do with some freshening up of the curtains and floors. It was fine for a one night stay. We stayed on a Saturday where the pub downstairs is open throughout the night. We did not find it too loud and were able to sleep.Absolutely incredible location; right at the centre.The pub is a great place to have a drink after a long day of sightseeing",positive
"weak stream in the douche.no nearby shopping facilities,

no tv in the room thnks G-Dvery friendly hosta refreshing touché of farm life",positive

"Nice hotel, right in the center, little bit expensive,but location is worth it",positive
"Room was hot, no air conditioning or fan (it was constantly over 30 degrees when I was there),

Clean, spacious room, friendly staff with good English, good choice of food (no English version of menu tho)",positive
"The light from the bathroom/toilet filters into the sleeping area because of the glass wall. This wakes up the other person in the room if the toilet is to be used in the night. ,

The hotel is very well located about 250m from the EU Commission, staff are very nice, the place is clean and at EUR 100 per night with breakfast included it was excellent value for money. Recommended.",positive
"The rooms, the hosts and the little host dog were all very charming. Located in a quiet street on walking distance from the Markt. Possibility to book the sauna on colder days. The breakfast was especially nice and every day the hosts cooked up something special like delicious rhubarb crumble or french toast.",positive

Excellent location.  Friendly staff.  Clean and comfortable room.",positive
"Was quite loud outside. There were only few toilets outside the rooms. The good idea is to install some bedside lamps and places to charge mobile phone near beds...,

We could check in around 1 am. Near hostel was quite loud because od Friday party. The breakfast was good. The hostel is situated in very good localization (very near old town and about more than 2 km far from bus/train station). Highly recommended for short visit in town.",positive
good location and good stuff,positive
"Communication with Annick, sent messages no reply. Did not see my host until I checked out.,

Location was beautiful. WiFi good. No information in the chalet about the village, what's available or where to eat and buy supplies. The key that I was told opened the garage didn't work, so no access to the garage.
Great walking in the forest just across the way.",negative
"The worst are showers,its a tiny space,no place to hang smth or put smth,when you try to open water before entering in order to wait til it comes warm it all comes on you and on the floor. In the end after this experience i havent showered. Yak
Toilets of downstairs are also terrible. 
Entrance through the door is blocket by those who are having drinks at their bar (its more thing of the management,not people who sit by the table next to door,

Location.clean sheets. It was warm (adjustable heating,but there is always smb who barely turns heating of)",positive
"We didn't realise that towels weren't provided until we got there, so it would've been good to have been told that in advance.,

There was lots of space and we were left in peace to enjoy our stay. Absolutely perfect for us!",positive

Great apartment. Funky and in keeping with the city.  Great location and Arthur was a fantastic host.",positive
"Nothing to complain5 for the price.  The staff at breakfast area were very nice,

Location location location",positive
"The room had basic facilities, but the shower could do with an upgrade and there is plenty of room to have a king size bed, rather than a  standard double. It would also be nice to have tea/coffee making facilities in the room.   It would also have been helpful to have menus in English, although we managed with Google Translator. ,

Excellent location, good food and friendly staff. Room was spacious and decent size. Breakfast was good, but no variation from day to day.",positive
"Fantastic and very helpful staff, excellent location and comfortable rooms",positive
"Erika and Dietrich are just super hosts ! Kind, warm & welcoming.Their place is really nice. So cosy and beautiful ! (and also very clean)With all those vintage objects everywhere, you feel like in an antique market.And last but not least, the breakfast is damn good +++Dikke Merci !",positive
"Nothing,

It felt very homely and relaxing",positive
"All was perfect,

I liked all, service, the room,... fabulous bed. I recommend it so much. I will book this one always that i go to that area.",positive
"nothing worth mentioning.  The room is very small, but if you read the reviews you should know that.  Again, it was in the information so it wasn't a problem, but make sure you are aware that they only take cash.,

Great location close to Flagey, Louis and public transport.  The room is very small but perfect for what I needed -- a clean and quiet place to sleep at an affordable price.  It has a shower in the room and a private toilet just outside the door of the room.  Nice coffee, tea facilities a small counter space and reliable fast wifi.  Exactly what I needed.  The owner was also very friendly and provided some great suggestions about nearby food options.",positive
"Having to leave,

The staff were so friendly and happy to help, the location was fabulous as my father in law has limited mobility and managed to walk to the Menin gate, museum.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone and we plan to go back very soon. The room was spacious, clean and perfect for our party of four",positive

The staff are kind and helpful. Breakfast is good. The hotel is clean and has a lift.",positive
"In the room was no cabinet or some place to keep our bags, clothes, just on the floor or in the bed. For 6 person just 3 electrical plug in and 2 chairs. In the shower no shelf for shower gel and water temperatur not possible to change. In the toilette no soap and some paper.,

The location is perfect, in the city center, everything are few minutes walking distance. The stle of bar really good. The room was clean and comfortable, bed also comfortable. Breakfast for extra 4 Euro was good (bread, butter, jam, nutella, egg, tea and coffee) but some meet and cheese missed.",positive
"An excellent location just outside Bruges, surrounded by fields, but only 2 minutes to the shops. Travel from the ferry in Dunkirk was quick and easy (about 45 mins). We travelled around Northern Belgium, visited Bruges, Ypres and various other small towns with ease from our base in Jabbeke. We were met on arrival by very friendly hosts. Nothing was too much trouble. There is a restaurant on site, and while it looked very good, with some excellent wines on display, we just did not get time to try it. The property was clean, spacious and comfortable with excellent wifi and we certainly plan to use this again.",positive

"As it’s a typical old house, to keep in mind that it’s not entirely soundproof, including a toilet in a room, however, we had no problem with that at all! ,

We had a pleasant stay in this charming real Brugge-spirit B&B! It’s located in an old typical house, just outside the busy city center, calm and nice neighbourhood. We liked a lot the hospitality of the owners (including the cutest doggy who loves to play and a cat). 
The breakfast was really good! Fresh juice, good quality local bread rolls (pistolet), warm eggs, salmon (I don’t like meat so really appreciate that), a homemade delicious dessert, etc! Yes, you have to eat it in a room (covid..), but it’s more than enough!",positive
"Not a lot to not like really. The bar was minimal and had little atmosphere, but was still adequate for a drink before heading out. ,

Gorgeous location and a lovely old building that has been refurbished tastefully. Really attentive and pleasant staff.",positive
"Very cosy room, very vlean and neat. Perfect for one or two persons. The owner of the appartment lives in the same house, but you have seperate entrance. The owner is very nice and friendly :)",positive
I definitely recommend staying here if you would like to stay in a cosy house in a very cool neighborhood. Room had everything inside and the bed was very comfortable.,positive
"No on-site parking due to the location. On-street parking is costly per day. Free on-street parking about 10-minute walk away.The hotel has an arrangement for garage parking locally but space is limited and has to be booked in advance.,

Hotel is situated on the main square ideally situated for the town, Menin Gate 5 minute walk away.Typical continental buffet-style breakfast.Mini Fridge & Tea & Coffee facilities in the room.",positive
"There definitely wasn’t enough showers on our floor. Showers, while a decent size, were probably the poorest I have experience in six months of travelling. Having to press a button every 20 seconds and a pathetic spray of water coming out. Rooms large but very sterile. ,

Good location, very helpful staff, nice to have a table and chairs in dorm room. Very decent breakfast.",positive
"The beds were not very comfortable and taking a shower while keeping the bathroom light on required speed and dexterity.,

Very clean. Nice helpful staff.",positive

The bathroom and the spacious rooms and outdoor area.",positive
"Nothing,

It is clean, modern, bright, large, comfortable & in a wonderful location.   We could walk to any of the sites in Antwerp.  There is a grocery store right next door and a wonderful bakery a few stores down. The kitchen lacks nothing.  There is even a little inviting balcony with a small table and 2 chairs. And Arthur, the owner, couldn’t have been nicer.  He gave us tips on what to see, where to eat, etc.   This was one of the nicest experiences we have had in our European travels.   Highly recommended.",positive
"Noise..we couldnt sleep..there was yelling and partying outside most of the night.The breakfast was mediocre..cold boiled eggs, old soft apples, glueten free buns were frozen in the middle.Taxis couldnt get to the hotel so it was difficult walking up hills on cobblestones. Fortunately we were able to pay a hotel guest to walk with us to the train station and carry our luggage on wheels for us...fortunately it wasnt raining.,

Clean, nice size tub with hot water, close to restaurants, comfortable beds, lovely front desk personnel.",positive

"Loved everything! No issues at all. ,

The staff were so helpful and polite. The reception was just brilliant. The location was ideal. Set in a beautiful street with canal views. Ten minutes walk to the main square with so much on route. The city itself is easy to navigate. The train station is just a few minutes walk away from the hotel. No need for taxis. Honestly fell in love with Brugge, the people the food! The beer! Can't wait to come back soon. Will stay at the same hotel next time! Christmas in Brugge with my girlfriend was more than magical!",positive
"Can't think of anything! Sometimes, I might have a small grievance not worth mentioning, but this time, I really don't have any negative points.,

I had a 10/10 experience at Résidence18. I had expected that it would be very good, given the reviews, but it surpassed my expectation. I really liked the owner's way of communicating, her kindness and helpfulness; everything is done to make you feel at home. The rooms are tastefully decorated with little caring touches, all very clean and with comfortable beds and strong shower. Great value for money, all in all. I was in Brussels to attend a course at the university, and will have to return - will definitely stay here again. Also - the bus from Central Station is really frequent, and the local neighbourhood, Flagey, has a great vibe.",positive
Love the Hotel Regina. I have used this hotel for many years and there has never been a problem. The perfect place to be while in Ypres!,positive
Room and facilities very clean. Bed comfy. Lovely breakfast. Very friendly,positive
"Very good facilities. Lockers in room. Good, sensitive lighting in room. Sockets by each bed. Nice indoor and outdoor communal space. Breakfast was ok.",positive
"No handwash was provided in the toilets.  The bar was open till 4am and the noise carried to the rooms somewhat.  But I wasn't too fussed about it as I still got some decent sleep. The staff could have been friendlier.,

Beds were comfy and the showers were clean. Location was excellent and easy to get to on foot from the station. The 24x7 reception helped because I did not have to worry about delays on my way to Bruges.",positive

I liked everything at this hotel: the room and the breakfast, also the staff was super friendly! They listened to what we needed and helped us to organise a small private reception. Big compliments to this hotel and my recommendations!",positive
"Le Flaneur is a delightful B&B - it is beautifully kept and displays an eclectic collection of vintage and antique objects. The hosts, Erika and Dietrich, are warm and welcoming and could not have been more helpful. The  breakfast is outstanding - Erika makes something extra every morning, so we had French toast one day and a quiche the next.  We will definitely be returning.",positive
"Can't complain ,

Everything! Clean comfortable modern rooms. Warm and bright. Great showers and clean bathrooms. Front of house staff were excellent. Guy on reception desk gave us wonderful recommendations of restaurants and bars outside the tourist traps. Central location metres from the main shopping street but quiet for sleeping at night.

"My bus got to bruges way to early (5am) and i went straight to the hostel, immediately i got there i saw the sight saying that the property is locked until 6 am so i decided to wait. It is necessary to mention that it was really cold and it was raining a little bit, maybe for people from Bruges that the normal weather but for me it was really cold. Someone came like 5 min before 6 and i explained the situation and i asked her if there was any place i could stay before checking in to protect from the rain, she just answer...""there is not place for you to stay until 8 am""!!! I was completely mad because i never asked for a room or something like that!! I was just looking for somewhere not to get wet!! I asked her if i could leave my luggage and fortunately she said ""yes, the looker room is downstairs"" at least i didmt have to carry my bags to the bus station for 30 min again.,

After all my issue i had a good stay, the other people in the lobby were really friendly, the place its super nice and clean! The breakfast was really good even if it was just cereals and bread.",positive

Location, people, nice breakfast, amazing staff.",positive
"The room is simple and the facilities are a little bit old. Don't get your hopes high it's a budget hostel anyway. The beds were really comfortable though :),

The atmosphere was so amazing thanks to being a bar at the same time. The breakfast was sufficient and the location is the one of the best thing about the hostel. The man on the bar/reception gave us a great local map. He was so friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stayed in here!",positive

Beautiful surroundings. Very welcoming host and hostesses. Spacious room. Comfortable bed. Modern and spacious bathroom.",positive

"Breakfast was a little dissapointing. Also there is the feeling that it lacks of air in the corridors and the room. ,

The bed was very comfortable, the room cozy, maybe it would be nice to have some day curtains in the room to cover a little the neighborhood view. Also it's nice to have tea in the room.",positive

"In the evening it becomes so noisy in the yard that it is simply impossible to fall asleep without an earplugs. Of course it's good that they are there and that they are for free, but not everyone is comfortable with sleeping with them.Not very convenient and clear adjustment of the shower.,

Nice and clean hostel. Shower rooms are separate for men and women. In the women's shower there is a hairdryer, which is also nice because I didn't expect to see it there. At the reception there are free earplugs, and it is better to stock them up, since the place is pretty noisy. The rooms are large, spacious, there is a table and chairs. Perfect place to stay for a large company. Bed linen and beds are clean. There is a separate small room with a free lockers for each person.",positive

"No big things to add. But the window of the room on the ground floor faced directly to the street on the side of the hotel, ended up staying with the curtains closed to have more privacy. Good breakfast, but could have more options for vegans.,

The room was pretty big and comfortable. The location was the best part: easy walk from all the touristic places, the Brussels Central Station, good restaurants and also breweries that you must visit. Very helpful and friendly staff.",positive
"Too much quiet :-),

Room,restaurant and surrounding.",positive
"Nothing.,

The lady at reception recognised me, as I was returning after 3 weeks. She also remembered that I had not been happy with the check-in process.

"The hallway to the rooms was a bit dark at night and the pink walls a bit dated-looking. I got a small single twin room as a solo traveler- I didn’t have a view out of my windows, but I wasn’t spending time in my room for the view.,

This was in town, easy to walk everywhere but not in a loud area. The room and bathroom were clean with a comfy bed and good bed linens, a room safe, hair drier and shampoo, body wash and soap. The provided breakfast was decent and took the hassle out of getting up and searching for a place when really all you want is a good coffee/tea, egg, fruit (and there were a ton of pastries and cheese cereal etc if that’s what you eat).

Great location for budget travelling. You can walk to most of attraction from here. Moreover, the double room we stayed was very spacious and simple.",negative
"The only thing that bothered me was that there could have been a small table in the room and the info sheet on the window was a bit dirty. I think we saw in the description also that there is one bed for 2 people, but in fact there were 2 beds (just a small detail, we then put the beds together).,

Good price and value + amazing location close to the center. Also very nice atmosphere by the bar downstairs. Checkin was very easy and flexible at the bar.",positive
"I knew that check in is not until 3pm. Staff were great to allow me to leave my luggage as I arrived earlier than check-in time. I went around and came back at 3pm but was made t0 wait close to about 30 minutes before my room was ready. Had to follow-up about 3 times before I was actually given my room. It is frustrating especially if there is a huge time difference from where you are from and you really need to lie down for a bit of rest.,

Location, location, location! It's very central, just few steps from the Grand Palace. Great restaurants are everywhere. Despite the fact that it is right in the middle of everything, your sleep would not be disturbed by any noise. Bed is comfortable and breakfast is good.",positive
"Twice I returned to my room from breakfast to find the maid had been in and left the door wide open while she cleaned other rooms. Personal possessions were clearly visible on the table from the hallway,

The hotel is clean, tidy in a lovely location and very well presented. The restaurant food was excellent, as was the selection on the bar. Generally the staff were polite & helpful if a impersonal at times",positive

The hotel has had a complete refurbishment since I last visited - the rooms to a high  standard but it has lost some of its character - great bathrooms and the new double glazing made a difference to the outside noise - good breakfast- even catered for the English!,positive

One towel costs 1 Eur.,

The room was spacious and clean
The location was great
Staff polite and helpful
Included breakfast was quite good",positive
"The room is very hot even with windows open. No airconditioning or electric fan inside the room. We suggest putting a pantry so that we won't disturb the staff when we need to microwave something or get some hot water. ,

Very huge property. I like the courtyard and some of the staff.",positive

"No reception staff to meet you, waited at the reception for 10 minutes before having to go to find someone in the bar to book us in. Parking is a good 10 minutes walk away and due to the traffic system was not easy to find.,

Huge and very room, Ideal location just across the road from the In Flanders Field Museum and approx 5 minutes walk to the Menin Gate.",positive

"there is no toilet in the room.  (as in every hostel you have to make your own bed,  i am fine with it, some people might not like it),

since the bar in the hostel is actually an bar open to public, you can find many  locals ( which is very good) .  and they have a wide variety of belgian beers with good prices.garden / terrace is awesome.",positive

There are many different interesting things at the hotel like in the museum.  The rooms are very stylish. And it's very comfortable like at home.  We'll definitely come back again. Also there lives a nice dog named Flanelle. She is a part of the domestic atmosphere of the hotel.",positive
"Nothing. ,

Great hotel in a super location. Staff were friendly and very knowledgeable.",positive
"The bed was uncomfortable. It is a bit annoying to me when I have to explain more than once when exactly will I arrive, and I had other engagements which I didn't know when will finish...in the end I had to call in order to check in.,

I like location ..it is in the quiet street though not very close to center by foot, but I knew where I was going. Value for money is good, especially compared to other accommodations I was looking in Brussels. Room looks very modern, it is a bit small, but it was OK for short stay.",positive
The hotel is in a great location.  Although it is by the main square the room we were in was very quiet and it was very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a good breakfast with something for everyone. We would definitely stay there again. Being able to reserve a parking space was an added bonus.,positive

"The place is perfect - there is nothing I would change here  The charm is in the imperfections !,

When you run a place with passion and love it shows. Right from the moment we stepped in Erika was instantly likeable ( a little puppy called Flanelle also helped :) ) Breakfast - see my photo attached , you are spoiled silly ! Just perfect and if you eat all that you dont need lunch till 3pm ! Property - 5 rooms all tastefully done , we were in number 3 right on top perfect for 2 people . It is a narrow staircase , and passageways but like being in a fairy tale home ! I would want one myself  im almost 6 foot tall and i got along just fine ! The whole house is a like a small time capsule of memorabilia from the past , European and otherwise . Dietrich is the big surprise with his phenomenal knowledge of everything in the house and the fascinating world of flea markets and treasures you can find , if youre a history buff you will love this .  We stayed 3 nights and will for sure come back in the Summer . The city of Brugge is time standing still , preserved , fresh and very romantic . Location :  It is only 600m from the main Markt Square and Belfry and 100m from the inner canal.  The reason kids are not allowed is because the place is not built for them , it is best for older teens and above . You need to be calm to enjoy the beauty of this home.  All said - the life of the place are Erika and Dietrich - one of the best couples we have stayed with in all our travels so far !",positive
"The pillows - but I'm being picky!!!,

This was such a lovely surprise after a long journey. Situated next to a canal in a charming quiet street just minutes from heart of the city. Super trendy decor. Loved it. The breakfast was amazingly good too. Incredible value for money. Oh and there's private parking too.",positive

Rooms are spacious and clean! Beds are comfortable, you have a big table in the room, bathrooms are spacious and clean. Breakfest is great. You have yogurts, flakes, milk, coffee, tea, toast, buns, croissants and all kinds of jams. The location is also good. And lockers are huge btw :)",positive
"as above shower in the room.
The mattresses have a kind of plastic protection I guess to make it more hygienic/ easier to clean. It wasn’t for as I didn’t sleep very well on those and it’s also noisy when moving around.,

Hostel was clean. I stayed in a 4-bed room and there was a small shower in the room (the door has a gap so it’s not really private, however it’s only a shower) which I personally don’t like much as it only creates more noises if someone showers early/ late. But that’s my personal opinion. ... They have a nice garden area and it’s close to the city centre.
The breakfast is great. I expected toast and butter, but they also have some fruits, cereals, eggs coffee (specialists) and tea.",positive
"Terrible bed, seems a water mattress. Bad shower experience.,

Very good location. Nice bar.",negative
"The only thing I would change would be the lack of a clear curtain during the day. Get too close to the window and they see you across the street.,

Location is absolutely great, right in the heart of the European Quarter, the staff was extra nice, the room comfortable enough and the Wi-Fi puts other hotels to shame.",positive
"Nothing, we liked everything ,

-the hosts, they are amazing, really friendly and kind. It feels really comfortable to be around them.
-the location is more than perfect. Not to close to the crowds, not too far.
-the facilities are great and it has a lot of charm. They have been collecting stuff from some years, so the B&B is also like a private museum.
-rooms are nice and really comfortable.
-the breakfast is top",positive
"The pillows were a little uncomfortable, and the towels were a little small. Breakfast selection a little small.But that’s only being very picky!,

Excellent design. Staff on reception very helpful and gave excellent tips on places to visit/eat whilst avoiding tourist traps.  The view from our room was amazing!",positive
"Location: it is located at 15 min from the city center but it's perfect.Personal: flexible and super kind. Room: like in the pics, and very clean.I highly recommend this place.",positive

Right at the square in the city centreLovely restaurants withing walking distanceSunday free parking",positive
"Shower room is dirty after many people used.  And it's normal though. ,

Location not too far from the train station but have to take buses. Walking is possible 30mins if you have backpack only. If not you have to drag your luggage on the cobblestone. Room was clean and big. Breakfast was buffet style. More than enough.",positive

"When we were staying there, there was a large party of women (possibly a hen party) staying at the same time, they were obnoxiously loud, the walls are quite thin, they were very loud when they came back in after their night out and no one in the hotel told them to be more respectful of other guests. They were also incredibly loud at breakfast time again.,

The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas, they had made a lovely effort to make the hotel look seasonal and beautiful. The staff were also really friendly and helpful and gave us a map and some advice on where to get some drinks during our visit.",positive
Perfect value for money. Very friendly owner. Very reliable wi-fi.,positive
"N/A,

Location, location, location. The hotel exceeded our expectations, we stayed in apartment 37 and it was large and fantastic for a family of four. Breakfast was included and it was fantastic.

The best breakfasts of our entire trip by far. A wonderful and tasty surprise every morning. It makes me want to return just to taste Erika's French toast again.",positive
"The only downside was the smaller size of the room, but that was expected for the price.,

Excellent and helpful host, clean room and thoughtful facilities. Not difficult to get to the city centre. Peaceful location compared to the rest of the Brussels.",positive

"I forgot something in the room which was not found after I left when I called. Really strange considering that was a  plastic bottle of white vinegar of a price of 0,60 EUR.,

Perfect location, walking distance to Berlaymont and to place Jourdan. Large room, extra comfortable bed. There was a salsa party at the bar when I arrived. It was too tempting and I danced, but reflecting now on the situation, I regret I did.",positive

"Nothing,

This hotel is ideally suited for public transport. It was very clean, breakfast was good and they got in gluten free bread for us. Very friendly and helpful family run hotel. It is also has a Nepalese restaurant, where the food is very good. This restaurant is worth a visit. Excellent 3 star hotel.",positive
"Guests should be explained how heating system works for better exploiting its capabilities,

Location and resources available to the house. Very sympathic the guest welcome package",positive
"Communication was poor. For several weeks we did not get a confirmation as to which apartment we actually booked. This was irrespective of repeated messages and even a phone call. The answer came on the day of arrival. We had to ask for check-in instructions several times as well. Two towels were dirty. There was no soap by the sink in the bathroom so we used the shower gel from the shower. No kitchen towel. One bulb cover needs fixed in the bathroom and lots of empty nails on the walls. Despite that we found everything else we needed and had a good stay. ,

The apartment is in excellent location. Spacious and bright.",positive

Excellent breakfast with eggs prepared in different ways every morning, fresh juice and other delicious things to make your morning better. The hosts were really friendly and nice. The location is very close to the city centre.",positive
"The town itself is not very exciting: there´s one restaurant only open on weekends and a little shop. It was, however, a great base from which to explore the surrounding area.,

It was a lovely little covid-safe cabin. It was very private and had pretty much everything we needed in order to stay with our baby, including a high chair, cot and baby bath. If I were to visit again (with a baby), I would bring a nappy change cushion and a night light.",positive
"No tea or coffee making facilities in the room and we were asked to pay for a coffee in the afternoon which we would have had to make ourselves! We decided to go out...Also the shower screen wasn't big enough and flooded the bathroom,

Great location for Bruges and all it's attractions. Most staff really knowledgeable and helpful.",positive
"We didn't stay long enough. ,

Hotel New Regina is in a perfect location opposite the Flanders Field Museum in the town square. As we arrived there was a youth orchestra playing in the square giving it a festival atmosphere. The staff were welcoming and our room was in a superb position on the front. It was a compact room but very comfortable and with a spacious bathroom. We were only 5 mins walk from the Menim Gate which was ideal for our purpose to attend the evening last post ceremony.

"Unfriendly staff. Rude while welcoming, and promised to have someone in the reception desk next morning at 6.00 am for my check out. I waited there until 6.10 am and no one was there, and I needed to leave to take a bus. Therefore, I did not get my $5 euro key-deposit back. They took long hours to finally take my phone call, and after 2 days insisting, they told me to send a mail. I did, and they can only deposit the money into a european bank account. They haven't done it yet, after a week, and even if they do, I would not recommend this place. Too many problems for just 1 night there. On top of that, they have no lift, and the bed was pretty bad.,

Good location.",negative

"Decor in hotel was dark and communal areas did smell of curry from the restaurant.,

Friendly staff and quiet night sleep.  Room was comfortable and bright.",negative
"The apartment has a very nice potential, but it lacks the ""final touch"". Some things were not very clean (the floor in some rooms, or the dish washer), the switch for the bed lamp was broken and the electrical wires were visible, so in the dark you could touch them by mistake, the light in the bedroom and the light from the front door were broken and other small things like this.I did not call the owners for these because those weren't things that bothered me that much.,

The apartment was is located in a very nice and quite place. It is very close to the important places to visit. The welcome was nice, they waited for us with the keys and gave us a short introduction. The apartment is large, with big rooms, it has all the utilities that you would need (kitchen with everything you need). If you do not want to cook, you have a lot of coffee shops and restaurants nearby. They do close pretty early, but if you make your program just right you have a nice selection of all types of food. There are also a lot of stores around.The door to the building closes at around 21 o'clock, but you have keys for all the doors so you can return at any time you desire.I would definitely stay here again.",positive
"It was perfect!,

Perfect location! On a small country road, 2 minute walk from hiking trails. Beautiful big fenced in backyard. Beautiful scenery.",positive
"There was no ventilation in the room and the ventilation in the bathroom was defect. It is not a big deal if you just open the windows, but that allows mosquitoes to come in.,

The staff was really friendly and gave us a warm welcome. They told us all about Brugge, where to go and which places to avoid. The room was clean, the beds where really comfortable and breakfast was pretty good.",positive
"Nothing,

Everything. Location right across from the WWI museum and short walk to Menin Gate. Excellent restaurant on site.",positive
"- the shower is pretty small so it's not ideal when you want to relax, it also feels pretty cluttered , a bigger space with a tub would feel more confortable;- the lobby chairs/seats could be a little more comfortable but need to be renovated/renewed, the door at the main entrance is permanently locked, the sign to go around and enter through the side door makes the entrance a little less fancy than it could be.,

- The hotel reception is convivial but as it is round, clients tend to stick around (downside: no discretion if you discuss your stay with the representative..)- The lobby is nice and lively, maybe not very discreet when it comes to people standing 1 foot away when you pay , the staff is friendly and pay attention to details, ""young professionals"" attitude,",positive

"Nice design of the hotel, great beds, friendly staff",positive

"Basic single beds were not too comfortable and furniture a bit shabby.,

Amazing location. Had a big room with a bathroom, very basic but functional. Friendly and helpful staff. A small bar in the cellar and inner yard as well. Ok breakfast, nothing special but as expected. Overall great value for money!",positive
Nice to have mobile electric heater.,positive

Friendly staff, good location and best of all - crisp white linen!! Well done",positive

Better than expected but watch out for the teams outside if you are a light sleeper",negative

Great location and spacious clean apartment.",positive

Everything",positive
"Sometimes the scent coming from the sink ,

Nice spacious place. The proximity to shops, transport makes it excellent to go around",positive
"I didn’t like only the stairs bcz the appartment was in the 3rd Floor but rather than that it’s really nice place for Families ,

It’s really a good place and I will come back again definitely",positive
"Very nice and clean little chalet with 2 rooms. The area is amazing, it is surrounded by nature. You can spend days exploring the village itself. Separate garden with barbecue facilities, tennis rackets and toys for kids(outside play). The host was very good too, she had extra supply of food (soup, pasta, pasta sauce etc).  You do need to pay extra for it but reasonable prices.",positive
Very friendly staff. Great quiet location within a few minutes walk of the busier areas.,positive
"Small details that architects often overlook. The shower room was separate from the WC. This might have advantages but it took space off the room and spoiled the otherwise spacious feeling. The WC/shower space taken could have been better configured to provide wardrobe hanging space, of which there was none. On arrival, we were note told the location of the breakfast room, which was not (as we had assumed) the main dining room. At breakfast coffee was served from a machine, causing a queue to form. Its much more convenient if staff serve coffee to the table. That was an unfortunate tendency toward lack of personal attention to guests.,

Hotel has been recently refurbished to a very high standard and the room was comfortable with efficient AC. The reception rooms were similarly upgraded, with the use of excellent materials and lighting, providing a most pleasant ambience.",positive
"Very nice hotel located near the EU buildings, very convenient if one has meetings there. The room was cozy and spacious enough, the bed comfortable. It was quiet. WiFi worked well. Staff was polite.",positive
"A bit noisy at bed time,

Good vibe with the pub.",positive
"It is a bit hot during the summer.,

The location is good. Very close to one of the train stations, and close to the old town. The breakfast is good, and there is a locker inside the room but you have to use 1 euro to use it (you can take it back after you open it). There is also a supermarket very close to the hostel, where you can get a nice packed salad, or other food.",positive
"No hooks in the bathroom and no tea/coffee facilities in the room,

Sam at reception was excellent recommending the best coffee in town and the best Brasserie for dinner",positive
"Very steep narrow stairways may be a problem if you have issues with stuff like that and not ideal if your carrying loads of luggage but again remember it is a hostel and not a hotel i have given the high marks for a hostel so dont expect 5 star luxury ,

This is a hostel so expect to share if you book late but they do have some double and twin rooms available no ensuite but all is kept nice and clean can be a bit noisy at times but again dont complain if you book into a place with an all night bar ,lively spot with great staff awesome pizzas and a party vibe",positive
Very nice bed en the city centre was nearby. Host was also very kind.,positive
Air conditioning unit was not there in the room. At least a ceiling fan or a pedastal fan should be kept in the room,negative
Beautiful place 😊,positive
"Comfortable, nice stafff",positive
"The apartment isn't maintained as best as it could be. My son sat on the coach and the back completely broke and he fell backwards! So I was not happy about that. When I emailed the property about it, they didn't do anything. With how big the apartment is, it would have been nice to have another toilet (there is only 1) and a washing machine.,

The location was fabulous, right in the centre. The apartment was huge and spacious and looked nice. It was easy to enter once we understood the code policy. The customer service was efficient and helpful.",negative
"No major problems, the price seems high upfront but given all the options included in it, it is worth it.,

The apartment was very big, it was clean, it had a nice terrace. The garage was included, which is very important The host was very helpful. Also the breakfast was good.",positive
"Wonderful peaceful location next to the canal and everything was nearby within walking distance; Museums, Churches, shops, supermarket etc 
The large room was lovely, hotel staff friendly and helpful and the breakfast every morning was amazing! The reserved car parking space we got was a huge bonus.  We will be back for sure!",positive
"The staff were very accommodating. We arrived after check in time but the key was left for us so we could arrive when suited. The hotel itself is very clean, fresh and a great place to stay. Right in the centre of Ypres, so ideally located for your trip. The bed was extremely comfy too! There is plenty of on street parking around the hotel for reasonable price too. Will happily go back",positive

"Nothing,

Breakfast",positive
My stay was excellent. The staff is great and helpful. Its comfortable and clean with a good mix of people. They also provide big lockers to ensure the safety of your valuables which is a big plus for me. The location is quite convenient too- the brussels central station is just about a few minutes walk. Lovely decor!,positive

Convenient location close to Railway station,Tram station and main attractions.",positive
"Was missing a few simple things. Iron and ironing board but Camille did organise one from the other apartment. Buy another one guys!Blind in the back room needs a bit of attention (strings are just tangled which is typical of those blinds so couldn't get it down) but wasn't a big deal.,

The central location is great. Our host Camille was very quick to respond to any requests. Apartment is well heated and spacious. Great place to use as a base.",positive
"A lot of rooms face out onto a fairly busy main road, so if you have an issue with noise (like I do), you're going to have difficulty getting a room to suit you. The car park is big and convenient, but has a gravel surface. Not brilliant for heavily laden hotel guests with roller-fitted suitcases. The might want to consider tarmacking it.,

The hotel is clean and comfortable, with a very good, lively, bar and restaurant, which seems to be open from breakfast through to chucking out time.Parking is plentiful and convenient.Staff are friendly and professional.The restaurant food and service are typically Belgian - i.e. very good. Breakfast is great, and the lady serving it very cheerful, so you get a nice start to the day.",positive
The sofa bed didn’t have no sheets and it was dirty a little bit,positive
"There was nothing not to like ,

Great apartment, very spacious, great facilities",positive
"That the breakfast had no variety, in the evening most of the lobby was out of lighting and this gave me the perception of an abandoned hotel

The hotel is situated close to the hot spots of Brugge",positive
"Excellent location 
Modern clean facilities",positive
"Modern simple style, comfortable bed, really easy check-in and -out",positive
"The toilet cubicles inside the public toilet station could be seperated better to give more privacy, and the fixed shower head with keep-pressing button was not comfortable.,

Very nice hostel in the center of Bruges. Very spacious rooms, very large lockers, nice common areas, kind staff, good breakfast and good bike rental service. I liked my stay at Snuffel and would recommend it to everyone.",positive

"Nothing ,

Very spacious and clean",positive
"Could have had a kettle in the room and a more comfy armchair.,

Loved the location of the hotel. The architecture of the building was beautiful and fitted in with the rest of Bruges. It was a lovely boutique hotel. The breakfast was very tasty, and the croissants were to die for. Bed was extremely comfortable.  Liked the free water they give you in case you were thirsty. Hotel staff were friendly.",positive
"Great location, nice modern and clean room.   Good breakfast.  Friendly staff",positive
"good,

good",positive
"Had a bit mixed up during check-in when the guy gave me wrong room number and I ended up entering people's bedroom. The breakfast is also a bit dry with no protein available. I am also not a big fan of push-for-water shower.,

Almost everything is great! The location, the spacious bedroom that look like a hotel bedroom, the large locker with keypad lock (no need for padlock), and the overall cleanliness of the hostel.",positive

This place is  well appointed , new and trendy and best described as a B&B although breakfast is extrra. The young lady staff ae very welcoming. Places to eat and the Citadel are nearby. Very secure parking.",positive

Great modern room decor and easy to find location. Dinner and breakfast were superb and the staff were very friendly.",positive
"The property wasn't easy to find however it was in a prominent part of Brussells and the location was excellent.  We had a small issue trying to find the front door to the apartments and although the host was very patient the accent differences made it difficult to understand the directions.  The lighting in the bathrooms was very poor for shaving and applying makeup and a clothes washing machine and microwave should be added.,

The location was excellent and the security to the apartment was also very good. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms well laid out.",negative
"Nice place in Schaerbeek 15’ walking from Schuman. Even though there is not a metro station at a close vicinity many buses serve the place to downtown or the Porte de Namur area and the bus 12 going to the airport has a stop (Meiser) in a walking distance. The place is nice and clean perfect especially for bigger groups or families. A secret tip of the area is the Van Dender pastry shop, officially providing sweets to the royal court of Belgium, as well as the Friday market at the Chasseurs Ardennais square.",positive
"The shower was over the bath which took a little bit of negotiation for shaky knees but the bath mat helped to give secure footing.,

The neighbourhood was quiet and the view over the canal was lovely! We loved sitting on the casement windows, which opened or tilted, and watch the people passing by on the other side of the canal. The staff were excellent and extremely friendly and obliging; carrying our luggage upstairs (we were at the end with no lift) and bringing us up a drink from the bar. Breakfast was very nice with plenty of variety and the coffee was good.  Loved the little terrace beside the canal and that you could have a drink from the bar until 10:30pm each evening.",positive
"Leaving,

Superb bed",positive
"This time a bit sloppy with providing enough coffee, thea, etc. in the room,

As always an easy going base to discover Bruxelles",positive

Bed, staff, and lounges.",positive

Amazing staff, cool bar on the first floor, good price and perfect location.",positive
"Distance from the centre of Namur is about 30 minutes walk. 2 Cats in the house causes a lot of cathair laying around in the B&B.  Price of is much to high for a overnight stay.,

Free carpark. Nice room with a good bed and bathroom.",negative
"Old builing and furniture. Spiders in the bathroom :),

Location, quite room",positive
"This was a very awkward experience! We only had SMS contact with the host. She did not respond to numerous calls and SMS messages when we were waiting for about half an hour in front of the door to be let in. In the end we sneaked into the building – following the cleaning lady? -  and found the front door of the apartment wide open. We found the keys to the apartment on the dining table with some instructions on a piece of paper. At that point we got an SMS with the code to the front door at street level to let us in – about half an hour after check-in time.It was cold (18 degrees) in the apartment but we could not get the heating to work. Although the thermostat was a simple device we got instructions – via SMS – on how to operate the thing. This text-conversation lasted about 2 hours and meanwhile we decided to look for warmth in de city while trying to get help from the host. She then committed to put two small heaters in the living room. These were barely sufficient to increase the temperature by 1 degree after 2 hours. A very cold experience and we will never go back.,

The interior of the apartment was spacious although without a soul.",negative
"Don't think there was anything I didn't like.,

Staff very accommodating, food fantastic. Clean, quiet and comfortable.",positive
"Our stay was great. The only surprise was that two bathrooms did not mean two toilets! This place has two bathrooms: one with a tub & shower, one with shower and then separate half-bathroom with the toilet and sink. We are a family of 4 adults and 1 toddler and it worked out just fine for us.,

We visited over the Christmas holiday - this location was perfect for exploring the Christmas markets.",positive
"The breakfast was super great, we love all the food&fruits&snakes. we love the big kitchen space as well in the unit. The host is very sweet and helpful. I will stay here again in the future trip to Brussels",positive

Very nice place. I stayed just one night by myself but I will go again with my partner. Very comfy and clean. Nicly decorated. By the new bridge you can walk to  the city center of namur in 5 min,positive
Nice staff.,positive
"Nobody to inform you at the arrival how to get in !! (Hopefully I Found the manager’s phone on the website, so after 5 calls and 2 messages I could be in touch with her to have to codes to get in). The appartement is nice but without any basical accessorize (no handsoap !! , that is absurd, even for the cheapest hotels). Apparently, previous guests already made this remark but the host negliged these details. Very upsetting. ,

The location is great.",negative
"The wallpaper could use some gluing back.some areas of the room had hanging wallpaper. We booked a double room, but our bed was 2 single beds put together with the gap in the middle. 
,

Good size room, clean and nice. 
Lovely breakfast and very helpful, kind staff.",positive
"The few things that we did not like are the following: we were total of 6 persons (4 adults and 2 children) but only had 4 pillows, which made sleeping rather uncomfortable.  When I asked the host for more pillows, they said that they do not have in stock.  Also, we only had a few towels (not enough for 4 nights) and we had to buy our own.  Bathrooms with baths and showers are clean and spacious, but they do not have toilets.  There is a separate bathroom in the corridor with toilet.,

Location was perfect, right in the centre and everything is within walking distance.  A metro station is situated only 1 minute away.  Rue Neuve (main shopping area in Brussels) situated just round the corner and also Boulevard Anspach (with shops, supermarkets and restaurants) are situated very close by.  Flat is very clean and spacious and has elevator access.  Entrance to the main door and to the apartment itself is done by a key-code.  Also, they provide facilities to drop the luggage after check-out in a nearby office.",negative
"Just the fact that the terrace door was closed the night of my departure ,

Everything",positive
The gentleman at reception was so very helpful and friendly guiding us on the tourist traps to avoid and tips of what to se and do - such as doing the boat ride which is only 8 euros instead of the horse and carriage ride which is nearly 50 euros.  Would definitely recommend going to this hotel.  Accommodation and breakfast were also great.,positive
"N/A,

Perfect location. Modern spacious room with air conditioning.  Staff very helpful. Breakfast good.",positive
"Spacious clean room, comfortable bed",positive
"Nothing, really. ,

Room was HUGE, lots of space to place your things and each bed had its individual power outlet and light.Lockers were very big and in separate place from the actual bedroom. When you open the door to your room it's a small room with lockers and then a door to the actual beds. This is a fantastic idea! You can open your bags and arrange your luggage without bothering your roomates. I'm guessing this also minimizes the risk of a guest bringing bed bugs, as their luggage doesn't get in contact with bedding. Breakfast is pretty good too. Staff is nice and since Bruges is pretty small, the location is fine.They have lockers (free of charge) to leave your luggage before or after check in.",positive
"Bathroom is too small, especially shower that is not so much comfortable during use.,

Nice hostel in a very good location - close to the city center and train station Gare du Midi, room is very clean and big enough, nice lounge area, tasty breakfast and good working wifi.",positive

The simpathy of the workers, the cleaning and the localization",positive

"The floor was a bit dirty. Some of the stuff in the flat was broken. There were no keys in the toilet, the toilet bowl needed cleaning. The sink in the bathroom was clogged. Some of the lights were not working.,

My family and I found our stay in Smartflats very convenient.It was exceptionally easy to get into the property - we had our password in an e-mail.The tiny problem we had due to my inattentiveness was resolved by the most friendly and efficient staff of Smartflats.The guys in the Smartflats lounge really helped us with the taxi service and boarding passes. Seriously, thank you Smartflats staff!The property is beautifully situated right next to all of the sights and attractions, probably the cheapest option in the city center.The kitchen is fully stocked with everything one might need.The linen was white and crispy-clean, smelling of freshness which was fully appreciated since we desperately needed good rest.In general, Smartflats is perfect for a not-very-lengthy stay.",positive
"Stairs as my apartment was a converted house,

Spacious, cleanliness , very near to bus stop",positive

"The hostel beds weren't comfortable, it was low so you could hit the head in the morning. We had bathroom in the room, the room was mixed dormitory with 6 people and bathroom's locker wasn't working, which is inconvenient of course. The room and bathroom weren't cleaned, and on the beds there were chewing gums sticked, gross. During the check in they are taking 5 euros in advance for the key (if you lost it, so after check Out they are giving it back). We were leaving at 6 am next day, so during the check in we told them and they told us that it won't be problem and somebody would be there, but apparently in the morning noone was there, we were knocking and waiting for 30 minutes and nobody appeared. So we had to go to catch our bus. We left the key, but we didn't get our 5 euros back because nobody was there. After we wrote to them and explain the situation and asked them to transfer our 5 euros back but no respond :) I don't suggest this hostel :) ,

"No major negatives,

Very central",positive
"My room was too dark for my taste. If the table could be positioned at least partially closer to the window it would be brilliant.,

The atmosphere in the bar and the beers were awesome! The barman suggested excellent beer to order!",positive
"The room could do with a bit of a lick of paint and the beds slipped about a bit on the hard floors but there was nothing major to complain about. I'd stay here again.,

The location was ideal, just opposite the railway station where the trains from Brussels arrive so if you're coming via Eurostar the location is perfect. The city centre is about 1.5-2 miles away but there are trams from over the road every few minutes. The staff were really friendly and helpful as well.",positive
Kamer - comfort bed was matig,negative
"Wi-Fi and coffee machine were not functional. Noise from the street in the living room. ,

Very spacious and comfortable. Modern facilities and great design. Rooms are located on the quiet side of the apartment. Right in the city center, close to everything.",positive
"We were given flat space in another building. Apartment was very nice. Flat was good for family with 2 kids.
It was clean, tidy. All facilities for short Brussel visit were sufficient.
Breakfast was nice.
Having garage, parking spaces is another advantage. Garage spaces and road to underground is very narrow, so please be careful :) 
Location wise, it was close to bus stop.",positive
"The state and quality of the rooms is really disapointing. Although they're advertised to be 20sqm, in reality they're about 15sqm max. The walls were dirty. You can't be a bit oversized if you want to use the bathroom. Breakfast is all bread, no fruits or yogurt offered.,

The building and the entrance are beautiful. The view on the canal was nice. Kind staff at the reception.",negative
"The coffee was not very good and when I asked for some more brown bread, I was told it had run out. We were at breakfast at 8.30am so there should have been more available.,

The room was large and spacious with a really comfortable bed and some chairs to relax in. The bathroom was good and the shower was great ,there was  a separate toilet. The dining room was very busy at breakfast time, so we were put in the brasserie which was calm and quiet.",positive
"Price of breakfast has increased steeply over the past few years. I remember when they were selling it for 8 Euros.,

I love this place, 5 or 6th stay here",positive
"The room was not heated. The shower tray in the common ladies' bathroom was a bit dirty and water pressure was not too high. A shelf in the shower would be a welcome addition, as well as some pictures/paintings on the walls to make the hostel look cozier. Those who like big, hearty and/or salty breakfasts should prepare themselves to avoid any disappointment.,

The staff was kind and helpful, and they gave us really good tips where to eat with the locals. Location is also good, only five minutes walk from the centre. Low prices, a wide Belgian beer selection and the possibility to play fooseball and board games were appreciated. Beds and mattresses are comfortable, wi-fi is good enough.",positive
"Staff, room, cleanness",positive
"Shower! The shower was in the bath with little room to move while having a shower.,

Location was perfect & very clean. Walking distance to train station. Would definitely stay here again.",positive
"There were all disgusting! For five rooms were two toilets, one of them out of order. Poor breakfast, tiny and not cleaning room, no good wifi, rude staff. ,

Near the center but not worth. They are so many hotels around. Money for nothing!",negative
Breakfast was fine - it hit the spot. The room was very large for what it was.,positive
Great Hotel !!!,positive

Great location, spacious room.",positive
"-,

Spaceous apartment with good service. Nice personnel.",positive
"Some small adaptation could have been done to make the eating in the room (due to covid) more comfortable. Also breakfast could be improved (lots of bread but not much to put on it and no dairy products).,

Very good location and nice building with charming canal view.",negative
"the lift was tiny, making it difficult for more than a handful of guests to be moved at a time. Parking is not on site although there is rarely trouble with security parking in the street. The price was on a par with other hotels in Ypres but excessive when compared with other major towns visited during our trip. It discouraged us from staying more than one night, and that night was only because we were laying a wreath at the Menin Gate that evening.,

nice location in the main square making it easy to visit restaurants and bars in the evening. The room was nice and of a reasonable but not exceptional size. There was good storage for our motorcycle gear.",positive
"We notice some stains in the linen and in the bathroom. But nothing that would ruin our stay, just a small detail.,

Easy check-in, great team. Comfortable room. Great environment with some music and places to work or have drinks.They have an option of ""fast breakfasts"" for 6e50 for 3 items, it was a nice surprise. Also an option of ""Green choice"" for short stays where you can refuse cleaning (eco-friendly) and get a 5e voucher to spend in the Hotel. Just across the street from the European Parliament and the House of European History, great places to visit.",positive
"Just one toilet (the vase) for men for one big floor.,

The recepction wich kept activities at night (untill 11pm) in a pub kind of way. Lovely to meet and hang out.",positive

"Great, professional staff. Typical budget hotel. I enjoyed my stay. Wonderful location.",positive
"I booked 2 beds in a shared room and one of the beds was a really small mattress directly on the floor.
Moreover, even though I paid for our stay beforehand through the app, they made us pay a 'city tax' (around €5). It was kind of suspicious.,

Location.",negative

Very friendly and welcoming staff. Good brasserie for dinner and breakfast.",negative

Very kind people !!,positive
"The staff is not friendly at all, we felt as if they were doing some favor to us by letting us stay in the hotel.
Their wifi password for customer says it all how relevant are we to them:
WifiPassword was “Irrelevant”
Its small thing but says the thinking of the staff.",negative
"You cannot get a better location in Ypres. Overlooking cloth hall, great view and a lovely hotel to use to visit the historic sites",positive
"Carpets in rooms. I generally dislike carpets cause they are dirt catchers.Fruit salad of the breakfast buffet was sour/not good for eating anymore,

Comfy, clean and spacy rooms. Fitnessroom. Its small with a limited choice of tools but still a nice addition to the hotel.",positive

Big room with comfortable bed
Enough of shower and toilet cabins
Good breakfast
Nice and Clean",positive
"Warm days could be a little bit tricky there because there is not a cooler system (no other hostel where I've been has had though). Coffee could be better.,

Really clean. All the furniture has a really good maintenance. The location is great. The food in breakfast is good as well. There are a bar and a outdoor common areas where you can have talks with other people. Also it was the quiet enough to sleep well.",positive

"clean  and gorgeous room.
easy access to everywhere in brussels by bus.
free parking.
highly recommend for various trip to brussels.",positive
"We booked the canal view room, but to me it was not worth the extra price. There are 2 very small windows in the room and the canal is actually really narrow and you can hardly see it from the room. However, this did not ruin our stay.,

The staff are really nice and friendly, the location is very good (5 min walking from city center). Room was nice and clean.",negative
"Nothing,

The staff were helpful and pleasant.",positive

Good hostel, good location, good breakfast !",positive
"There is no fridge, no tea cups, no water boiler in the room.,

The room with the attic is very big.  The beds are comfortable. The location is great. It's near the central station and pedestrian zone.  A lot of shops are around. It's the walking distance to almost every landscapes.",positive
"WiFi was poor,

Location is great, clean and well equipped",positive
"Staff is very kind and helpful
Place nice and cozy, terraces and good view",positive
"The room was extremely small, there wasn’t any night table available, nor fridge in the room. The room we booked was supposed to have canal view - it did, through two incredibly small windows. By the way, the canal view is nothing special - so there’s no point on paying extra for it. ,

Based on the description on booking and previous customer reviews, we arrived with high expectations at the hotel - therefore, the general opinion about it is not that great. The location was good, at walking distance from the center and on a quiet street. The hotel staff was helpful to point us the parking options, as the hotel doesn’t have a parking space. The breakfast was ok. The room was clean and bed was very soft.",negative
"The entrance ramp into the street was a bit dangerous when wet,

Breakfast was good; location ideal; staff very friendly and helpful",positive
"I found the breakfast offer very expensive and there is nothing close to the neighborhood for coffee. Only from 10am in the morning.,

The hotel is perfect, if you had more affordable breakfast would be ideal.I really liked the room, very comfortable and with fridge and coffee making equipment. The bed is very comfortable. I found the room excellent.",positive

Breakfast was typical of other stays we had. Still, very good.",positive

Nothing!!!",negative

"It's a lovely hotel in a lovely location - our only complaint would be the number of flies in the dining room,

Our room was lovely, good size. Service was great and we really enjoyed dinner on both nights. We enjoyed sitting by the small lake in front of the hotel after dinner, watching the fish",positive
"nothing,

super location",positive
"It got quite noisy up in the room as there was a crowd outside drinking and laughing well into the night. Especially disturbing because it was a very warm night and there was no choice but to sleep with the windows open.I might suggest that the partying is moved indoors at a reasonable time to allow the guests who have early starts to get a decent nights rest.,

Friendly staff who were all probably family and who worked well together despite the pressure of catering to a full house on a grand prix weekend. Decent service delivered with a smile.Lovely little place in very quiet and picturesque setting.",positive
"Was hoping to have towels but were not there,

Old classic style!",positive
"Really nothing to complain. If anything the backyard is very empty, some trees and flowers would make it more attractive. ,

We mostly chose this place based on the reviews and were not disappointed. The cottage is spacious, has all amenities you would expect, good beds, nice bathroom, and the highlight is the great swimming pool. The kitchen is well equipped and there is a proper bbq in the yard.
The owners are great people and helped us feel comfortable even though our French is quite poor.",positive
"Rooms a bit out-dated.,

Nice and cosy hotel in a relaxing atmosphere.Very good restaurant with a big garden.",positive
"Wi-fi didn't work well, connection would crash all the time. I expected being able to keep stuff in a fridge since it's a hostel but they don't have a kitchen for the guests use.,

Location",positive
"Since the hostel also serves as a bar, it was impossible to sleep (without earplugs) on a friday night. The staff was pretty blunt and almost rude both at the bar and at the hostel, but probably because they have to work way too much. In toilets, there were no hangers, no soaps, no mirrors etc. since they are the only private places when you stay in a dorm, you only get frustrated. No ventilation in the room, and since it's so noisy you cannot open the window neither.,

The location is pretty good, however Bruges is a small town so that does not matter so much. Bedding was okay and clean.",negative
"Having to make my own bed (you know, when you're tired). I was expecting a larger room. The pervasive smell of smoke (perhaps coming from the stairway?). Fine for short stay & max 2 adults who enjoy the outdoor.,

Great downtown location. Easy access to food&shops. Right on the Metro line to the EU district. Friendly host.",negative
"Very nice room in the city centre of brugge. (Near to ‘Begijnhof’. The host offered us free parking space in front of the house and we could use the garage to store our bikes.
Breakfast can be taken in the tearoom right next to the property.
I would recommend this room if you want to visit Brugge for a night or two. Restaurants are very close (walking distance).",positive
"No aircon but the windows could be left open which helped,

The room was spotlessly clean and airy",positive
Fantastic place. Clean answer quite. Very friendly host. The region I see amazing,positive

The location was prime, really easy to get around, and the staff were really friendly! Would definitely stay here again.",positive
"they offer no fans or any other way of ventilation in the room, and if you open the windows then the room gets filled with mosquitoes. No warning of it or they didn't provide any mosquito repeller or anything. we booked a twin room, the bed was ok, the bathroom was clean, the only problem was it was too hot and A LOT OF MOSQUITOES.,

"Only given one key 🔑,

Location",positive
"This is a great location with super hosts.  I stayed here en route from Calais & it was a great stop.  There's a park nearby to de-stress a little with the town & food options around the corner. I had a big welcome upon arrival & help with my luggage up the stairs, parking etc. The room is super comfortable, spotlessly clean & super fluffy towels!  Although COVID times made evening food difficult as most restaurants close early, the addition of a microwave, fridge, plates & cutlery was most welcomed. Tea/Coffee (and special request of milk) ensured a nice easy start to the day & my onward travel.  I'll be sure to stay here again when I return. Tip: make sure you get the code to enter as the bell is not used ;-)  .",positive

"Jason and his wife are such a great hosts! They run a beautiful B&B. We loved our stay so much ! Photos don't judge the charachter of property enough. Big and comfy bed, pristine bathroom and fresh coffee in the morning. There are guides and photo albums of Brugge in the room-very helpfull. I highly recommend this B&B !!!!",positive
"Good breakfast, really friendly staff :)",positive

"Some sounds from neighbor was came through in night. It was acceptable level though.Bit cold due to less controlable oil heater.,

Very friendly reception staff. They kindly advised recommendation of restaurant, choco shop and sightseeing spots.And Nice interior & exterior.And Good Iocation.",positive
"The room rate was not incredibly high but it was not quite value for money if facilities provided were only limited and if the room size was just not spacious enough.  Still, it is not a bad option especially for your late arrival into the city and early departure from it after the city visit completes. ,

It is very centrally located out of the central station.  Other attractions are about 20-25 minutes away if you are at a leisurely pace.  Alternatively, you can take the city’s tram into the heart of old town.",positive
"The bathrooms don’t have hooks or tables/stands to put clothes and toiletries on. The tissue machine in the bathroom was difficult sometimes. I didn’t mind the timer in the shower, but the water pressure is really low. Room was a little small, and there wasn’t any hand soap in the room (but there was a sink!) ,

Location is central, near Grand Place and Brussels Central station. Breakfast was really good, no deli meats but there were about three kinds of bread, some jams and sweet spreads, juices and hot beverages. In room lockers were really convenient and spacious. The lockers used the kind of locks they use in museums (one where you put a 1€ coin in to lock). Staff was friendly and helpful!",positive

"Nothing really, the room was a little tight at times, but this is easily the best 3 star hotel we have ever stayed in and we would happily stay again.,

A very elegant no fuss hotel. Excellent staff who were very helpful with tips and ideas on where to visit and eat in Bruges. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast buffet was a limited selection but it was classy, tasty and fresh. The hotel has a refreshingly modern design aesthetic for Bruges, and we thought it was perfect for couples wanting to see the city being well situated within the heart of the old town.",positive

Staff friendliness",positive
Although the rooms are basic they are clean and serve the purpose. A little disappointed to find there was no hair dryer.  However what is outstanding about this hotel is the resturant attached to the service station. The food was unbelievable and the service outstanding.

"At first, we got the room next to the showers, and since the soundproof is bad there and the doors are pretty loud we could hear every single person entering showers/toilets and taking showers late night and early morning. That was not really a pleasant night (kinda sleepless), but the staff was very nice and it was possible to move for the second night to another room further from bathrooms.,

The location of the hostel is very convenient, close to the center. The rooms are pretty basic but essentially all you need (having lockers in the room - huge plus), breakfast was good. Overall, it was a decent experience.",negative
"Not every staff speaks good English and I found it a bit difficult to communicate on occasion.,

Very good location if you're travelling to/from Sint-Peter's station and don't want to get into the city. Any other place is easy to reach from here as trams and busses go by the station.

The room we had was spacious and clean. Our room was quiet - we didn't hear anyone else even though there must have been many other guests (since the parking was full). The parking is secure and on the hotel ground. There was disinfectant available at the entrance and the key was cleaned before receiving it.",positive

Close to the train station, was clean and the personal is kind.",negative
"The shower didn't last for too long and you had to be pushing the button every 30 seconds. That was a bit annoying. At the end of our stay we had to leave the blankets in reception, so a bag to take them all there would have been appreciated.,

Its location is not bad.The breakfast offered it's quite complete (bread, fruit, juice, tea, coffee, chocolate, butter, philadelphia, eggs, jam).Staff is nice, we asked for a hair dryer and they kindly lend us one.We were able to leave the luggage in the luggage room free of charge after leaving the room.",positive

"Staff was not overly friendly, and well, it's pretty basic. You get what you pay for.,

I had to travel to Brussels to do interviews for my thesis and stayed at this hostel all three times. The location is great, I could walk to all of my appointments at the EP and Commission. The rooms are clean and otherwise quite okay. Desk in the room was perfect so I could work a bit. Not loud, but I might just have been lucky with my roommates all three times. Free breakfast is basic but perfectly OK. Safe to walk outside at night, easy to find and easy to find places to eat around here. Good locker to keep your stuff in.",positive

"Quite noisy,

So close to the Grand Place",positive
"the breakfast could be improved, its was a bit poor for a 4 star hotel in europe",positive
"FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKES SLEEPING IN NIGHT CLUBS. REALLY NOISY AND THE STAFF IS LIKE 20 YEARS OLD, SO ALL THEY CARE IS ABOUT HAVING FUN AND HANG OUT WITH THE DRUNK PEOPLE IN THE BAR. ,

Only the location is good, I wouldnt come back",negative
"The hotel room had a very bad acoustic isolation. From 8h in the morning, I could hear every client that was leaving the hotel. The noise from the stairway and from the room floor was so loud it woke me up several times. Also, we paid an expensive reservation for the 31st December to the 1st January, we told the staff that we would like to sleep a bit later than 11h (the checkout time) but at 11h they staff was knocking on our door so as we wake up and leave, they were a bit unpolite, as they could offer us an extra cost for extra 2h or so in the room, instead of yelling at our door.,

Just In front of Ghent Train Station, the location is really good and close to the city center.",negative
"Our windows was broken and we couldn't close it. We spoke with the reception but they told us first that we can't close it ;) when they came to our room they told us they need to change the window in whole hostel and this is not closing. We asked for another  room  but the nice guy from reception returned in our room in ca. 1 our (around 24)so we were already in the bed sleeping.
It was a bit loudly  becuase of the street close to the hostel. Moreover the shower was terrible! I don't  know how I could wash my long hairs there. You need to push the bottom each 15 sec and there is coming only a bit water from the up. after the shower half of bathroom was unter the water,without any towel on the floor.
The breakfast was really poor.  No chees, no ham.. only bread, jam, nutella, müsli and bananas.
,

The bar in the hostel is really nice,but there ware no people, even dove  it was Friday night :(",positive
"Nothing,

It was an excellent hotel. The staff where very friendly and accommodation. The rooms where modern, clean and stylish. Location was excellent and everything was a less than 10 minute walk away. Added bonus was the beer vending machine in the lobby.",positive
"The location is peaceful indeed, that means it takes 10-15 min by walk to the ring tram track or to the closest metro station, might be a problem for someone. The room (numb.11) was very small,  moreover the furniture layout made it even more miserable (wardrobe in the middle of the room ?!). The mattress was too soft for me, made my back aches after a few nights. A duvet was double, the big one,  I had to share it with my daughter, a nightmare for someone who is not used to sleep like that.,

Breakfast was wonderful, very good coffee. Plus we were offered to use the kitchen and take a snack or tea anytime during our stay, what I really have appreciated. Location is very nice, good quarter (close to EU district), clean, safe and quiet.  Wifi no problem. Bathroom nice, clean.",positive

We arrived late (by bike) and the staff were very helpful, providing a superb dinner even though the kitchen was about to close.",positive

Fantastic apartment. Great breakfast. Easy secure parking. Great stay.",positive
"Perhaps an additional coffee machine at breakfast.  Coffee was excellent but due to the speed of the machine there was a queue when busy.,

The room was light, airy and modern.  There was attention to detail. Beds were extremely comfortable and we were very impressed with the quality and choice of breakfast.  The staff were very helpful and friendly and we would definitely stay here again. Excellent location and value for money.",positive

It’s clean, and the room for 6-bed female dorm is big.",positive

Very very small bathroom.
Bad smell in the room.

Location
Very close to Station Gent Sint Pieters 
The staff is polite and helpful",negative

The location of the hostel is great just 3 minutes away from central train station.",positive
"Adriana, the recepionist, was fantastic!!!",positive
"The apartment was larger than expected and actually really stylish with it's high ceilings. All the appliances were there and even coffee and tea was in the kitchen cabinet.  Accessing the apartment and parking space was made simple and easy to understand. Although the reception and breakfast area was in a different building than the acutal apartment - it was a 2 min walk which was refreshing in the morning (at least for me). The breakfast itself was plentyful with lots of sweets. All of which i couldn't get aroung to trying. Some sweets, fruits and biscuits were in the breakfast area all day long so one could get a quick snack if wanted. The WiFi connection was fast as well.",positive

Counter staff rude and very noisy,negative
"The soap dispenser in the bathroom was a bit malfunctioning.,

Room was excellent. The area was fantastic - great if you want to know more about the European Parliament, and a bit quieter and less touristy than the centre. A great Paul around the corner. The gym was also really good. The room was excellently designed. Reading material was included that was actually really good.",positive
"Staff weren't very friendly. ,

Breakfast was nice and with many options to choose from. Hostel is well located, but Brugge is not that big, so everything is within a fair walking distance.",positive

Great low cost accommodation in Brussels. Good location, and breakfast is included.",positive

A lovely spacious room with all the necessary amenities. Really good, central location, a stone's throw from the centre  ('T Zand and street leading to Grote Markt and Belfry).",positive
"Very narrow garage and it was difficult to park the car without damaging. The main problem is check-in if you arrive late. They sent me the door code by email and they told me that the key will be at the reception desk, however they forgot to leave the keys (human error). At the reception, there is a phone number for emergency 24/7 and within 15 minutes they resolved the problem.,

Very good apartment, bathroom was very clean, big and well arranged, very delicious breakfast, snacks and drinks all the time, free parking. Unfortunately I stayed only one night.",positive
"Floor of bedroom really cold. Bed not made by housekeeping. ,

The food in the restaurant.",positive
"The fire alarm went off in the night and how the personnel responded to the fire alarm was not good. I worked in hotels myself and the actions taken from the moment that the fire alarm went off were not good and not safe if there turned out the be real fire.,

The breakfast was really good. The offer was good and the coffee was amazing. They also had good suggestions for people with allergies.",negative
"No fridge in the room, very poor breakfast buffet and breakfast served in the lobby which is not nicely furnished. Doors of The wardrops are aboıtvto come off.,

Location is perfect",negative
Cleaning and comfort,positive
It was a lot of noice from the courtyard and pub. It ended about 12:30 pm every night,positive
There is no handwash soap provided for you!,positive
"Nice location, close to the center;we stood for 2nights  and we had a nice clean room with bath tub so was perfect to have a moment to relax after a day trip in the city center.",positive
Really spacy appartment with foud beds for very good price comparing with small hotel rooms in hotels around. Small discomfort could be if you stay in other building and have to go for a breakfast across the street. Anyway it's good place to stay with good connection to the city centre by bus.,positive

"Nothing.,

I stayed here on recommendation and it did not disappoint. I slept very well in a recently refurbished room with excellent shower with a decent water pressure and temp control - it is possible to achieve on the second floor! Breakfast was plentiful and excellent quality. Location wise could not have been much better opposite the Cloth Hall. Whilst I was not driving and parking was not a concern facilities are not far away. I was particularly impressed by the staff - all very friendly and efficient. I’d have no hesitation about visiting again.",positive

The receptionist was excellent. Extremely accommodating and good with her English. The changes she altered to allow us to book another room was fantastic. . Would go again. Location was amazing!",positive
"The apartment wasn’t on the same building as the reception, and we needed to cross the street to have breakfast. Thank goodness the weather was nice, but I wouldn’t like it in winter or with rain.
Not close to the city center.,

The apartment was great: very clean, new furniture, huge windows, quiet...The kitchen had everything one can need (coffee machine, kettle, etc). Good breakfast. Fruit and snacks always available.",positive
"Hotel Car parking was 10 /15 min walk away .. and although inside parking it was not secure as stated.,

Great beds and pillows",positive
"We liked the location, staff and breakfast.",positive
"We booked in at 3.15pm and at 4pm I reported that hardly any of the lights in our room were working (just the one by the door) which was very inconvenient. I was told that both the maintenance man and the hotel manager had already left for the day (which seems crazy when people book in after 3pm!). The reception guy (who had a definite air of acting like he was better than everyone else) said he’d report it to be fixed the next day. Apparently there were no other rooms available for us to move to. He said he’d change the bulbs that afternoon. 
It was not fixed that day, nor the next. There was no apology and he clearly didn’t care. It was my 50th birthday trip and this spoilt it for me. There was no attempt to compensate for the disappointment.
We also couldn’t open/close one of the curtains (it was stuck half way) so I slept very badly as the light came in in the morning.
There was also a LOT of noise from other guests.
The room was tired and tatty.
I would not stay here again.,

The location is great - close to the station and very close to the Grand Place",negative
super happy with my stay here. staff were very helpful.,positive
"Shower water pressure is way too low. ,

Rooms are clean but pretty much not furnished. There's a bed and a couple of chairs in a big 2 person private room.",positive
"We got a really noisy room the first 2 nights, it was impossible to sleep. After the first night we asked to change it and since they didn’t have free rooms, they changed our room only for the last night. The rooms could be much cleaner,

The breakfast was of good quality even though not so many choices. The location was great, 600m from the center and central station.",positive
"We had in issue with some of the lights (e.g. the bathroom light kept flickering when you turned it on).,

The bed was incredibly comfy, we slept exceptionally well. I can also highly recommend long baths in the bathtub - it was really large and a great comfort after a long day of walking in the cold. The staff was also very helpful and friendful.",negative
"It would have been nice to get water for the breakfast and maybe they could invest into a professional coffee machine where you can get cappuccinos or latte macchiatos.,

Very nice portier who took care of us and was available all the time if we had questions. We had a whole apartment to ourselves with a fully equipped kitchen. The little garden and view were perfect and there are a few nice restaurants as well as a supermarket around. Breakfast was amazing. The women in charge kept refilling it constantly. You got a nice selection of cheeses, hams, hard boiled eggs, fish, cakes and fresh fruits. When we arrived we were told we were welcome to enjoy breakfast although we only booked the Sunday one. Bus stop is right around the corner and you’re in the city in 15 minutes. I was able to park in the private parking garage. The apartment was exceptionally clean. There was shampoo, many towels and everything else provided. We really enjoyed our stay.",positive
"Have to say we were all pleased with the Hotel.,

From start to finish - initial greeting through to booking out a great team, very relaxed, accommidating and helpful.  Superb location in the main square - immediately opposite Cloth Hall and Flanders Museum and a number of excellent bars and restaurants.",positive

"Charged me twice by accident and not enough tea and coffee for 2 people and didn’t have any la your or dairy free milk options. ,

Very helpful staff that let us leave our bags when we arrived early and the day we left whilst we went shopping. Clean rooms with comfortable bed and a good sized bathroom.",positive
"Excellent service.,

I loved my apartment. It felt homely with a well-considered decor. I share the same taste with the designer. Down to the selection of art work. I really liked the privacy of the apartment and the collective breakfast experience. It is a win/win situation. I loved the garden space also. The idea of having snacks and fruits available is a good one, as I did not have to worry about buying snacks. Great hospitality on the front desk. This will be my home away from home, the next time I visit Brussel. Also great value for money- which is always a bonus.",positive
"The rooms were very warm and you couldn't control the temperature. Breakfast was great but probably could do with a faster coffee machine.,

Location is best. The staff is amazing.",positive
"Nice, comfortable hotel. good location",positive
"Private room is poor value for money based on comparison to cheap hotel. Don't expect to have to make and strip bed for over £90.,

Staff in general were very helpful. There was a fan to help with the heat.",positive
"It wasn’t a huge deal for us, but my feedback would be that the shower needs improvement. It was stuck in one position so wasn’t suitable for taller people, it leaked flooding the floor and the drain was really slow, so water accumulated up to your ankles (shower is in the bathtub). The staff was happy to give us extra floor mats to help with the leak, though, that was good. ,

The location is excellent, quick walk to the historical center, beautiful building. The staff was very kind and polite and accommodated our requests. The room was clean. There’s parking (additional cost) which is convenient. Staff asked if everything was ok, showed interested and overall professionalism. There’s an ice and vending machine at reception too.",positive

"The only real “discomfort” was well the bathroom door which was half full half with fixed shutters, making it very hard to....well relax on the toilet :))) as the shutters act like a window.,

The hotel is located on a very nice street, 5 min away walk from the city center. It is a very beautiful belgian style house with small studio aparments. Our studio was very nice,clean, simple design yet very well combined, it had 2 full size beds, both comfortable, a small kitchen with all you need ( inclduing dishwasher) and very large bthroom with walk-in shower. The amount of natural light in the room was excellent having lots of big windows facing either the garden or the street. There is also the posibility to park your car on the drive way and store your bicycles in a very huge garage.",positive

Excellent host. :),positive
"We have no complaints. Not fundamental for the type of accomodation and the length of our stay, but the kitchenware is very basic (good pots though!). We also enjoyed the coffee machine, with free pods.,

Beautiful studio in a charming villa with view on the park of De Haan. Very comfortable furniture and decor curated in the details. The kitchen was a great plus in this period of social distancing (for this reason there was no breakfast included). Clean, silent, relaxing, all that we needed for a getaway. The hosts are very welcoming and offered us chocolates and waffles.The seafront is less than 5 minutes on foot and we enjoyed many walks in the dunes and woods nearby.",positive

It’s so obvious on the coffee cups,

Location quite central, very comfortable, staff were friendly",positive
The hosts were so nice! Both of them were very easy going and helpful. This place has everything you need and is in the middle of the city center. I loved that we could use the kitchen and cook our own meal. The parking spots right down the street were free of charge in the evening.,positive
"Check-out time a bit early,

Spacious terrasse, great kitchen appliances",positive
"Our stay was perfect. The house is beautiful and has a very good location - close to the beach and also close to facilities like the supermarket, tennis court, and restaurants. The hosts were pleasant and friendly. The studio has a great atmosphere and cool details (lights in the closet, good coffee, touchpads for the lighting in the rooms, smart tv and many more). Every day the room was cleaned, which is nice because it can become a bit sandy after spending the whole day at the beach! We had a very delicious ice cream and tasty chocolate from Leonidas, arranged by the host. Really looking forward to go back to Villa Emilia. Would recommend it to everyone!",positive
"Bedroom was located above the kitchen. When the extractor fan was on (most of the evening and early morning) vibrations and noise were awful in the room.  The smell wasn't great either. Although staff were polite they weren't very welcoming/friendly. They barely acknowledged us and didn't speak to the children once!,

Accomodation was clean and modern and location was great for our trip to Brugges.",positive

"None,

It was nice  and quiet place in Brussels center, clean",positive
"Not a problem, just a suggestion. The kitchen area is great and the coffee machine really appreciated. We would have liked another set of cutlery, glasses and crockery to make life a little easier, and we both love toast so would have liked a toaster. 🙂,

Lovely hosts, excellent location, fantastic rooms and great local vibe. We loved our stay.",positive

"Alexandr was very kind, friendly and helped us with the registration (I was one day more than 5 business days), which is absolutely necessary (detailed check on departure). He took care of us from the beginning until the taxi's departure. It was great, and without it we could hardly handle everything so easily. Thanks a lot for a great stay. Markéta",positive

Excellent location in the heart of Minsk. Clean and comfortable. Very good value for money. An ideal base for a visit to the city.",positive

Staff were very helpful  great secure parking and location a  5 minute walk to the centre",positive
"There are too few shower rooms for women (for the floor that I stayed).,

A nice place with a reasonable price. Although it is a bit far from the station, you can take a free shuttle bus that comes every 20 mins. The breakfast is great!",positive
"The tv didn't work. But who cares about tv?,

The location is exceptional. Service is friendly and helpful.",positive
"We have to arrange our own beds, the restroom was not really clean during my stay. It could be better for the price ,

The manager delivered keys as requested earlier the check-in time and allowed to stai after the check-out time.,positive
"The hotel says it has parking available, which it does.It does not say that it is a 10 minuet walk away, which is not a problem providing it's not raining,

Good location. Warm rooms and a good brealfast",positive

ROOm v quiet, aircon silent, blackout curtains, comfortable, clean, fab shower, free upgrade!",positive
"The bed was too small for 2 people, maybe the heat didn’t help as well which is unusual, and no AC (as most of the hotels) ,

The staff were very helpful, the hotel decor was pretty fancy :) the breakfast was delicious for just for just 12,5 euros. A car parking was provided for 15 euros as well",positive
"Good locationI like the bar and the atmosphere around it",positive

"Pressure to buy breakfast,

Beautiful location.nice room.",positive
"Nothing,

Great & quiet location",positive
This is a nice a friendly hotel that I always look to book when visiting Brugge. The hotel isn’t large but makes up for it with the location. The hotel does not have a bar but being in the centre it is within a few meters of the city centre so it doesn’t need one. There is plenty of choice for breakfast and I particularly enjoyed the fresh pancake machine.,positive
"I requested an early check in which was approved on Booking.com, but did not ultimately occur.,

Breakfast was good! Perhaps not as extensive as other accommodations, but considering the price I paid for the room it was certainly very worthwhile.",positive
Given the exceptional difficult circumstances the staff were fantastic.,positive
"It’s always lound. I always heard people walking around close the door and open the door whole night. I can’t even sleep. Shower room and toilet at my floor are broken can’t use it.,

Hostel not too far from train station. Good staff even I check in at 1am. Bed was soft.",positive
Excellent place! Comfortable flat and awesome owner!!❤️❤️,positive
This charming property was better than we could have imagined! Unfortunately we could only stay for one night but wish it was for longer. Thank you Hilde for a delicious breakfast & a lovely stay at your beautifully renovated property. We hope to be back someday!,positive
"Lovely people, very cosy atmosphere and a perfect location. All the ingredients for a city trip to magical Leuven!",positive
"We arrived at 2.35pm to be told our room wasn’t ready and to come back at 3pm. We very much had the impression that the room was ready and they just have a policy of making you wait until the 3pm check in time. When we got our room it had 5 or 6 flies buzzing round, and the sloping walls were thick with dust and dirt. We went down to ask for a different room, and were asked if we had touched anything in the room. I do wonder if we would have been told we couldn’t change rooms if we had in fact touched something. We were then told that the walls weren’t dirty, it was shadow, despite us saying we had brushed some of it off. The man at reception continued to argue, but nevertheless changed our room. We came down later and the man in reception continued to argue, so asked to speak to the manager. He apologised, and offered us late check out. Later that evening we returned and the receptionist did then apologise, but STILL argued that we were wrong and the room wasn’t dirty! The room was also very noisy, we had a poor nights sleep because of the loud shouting on the street.,

Location was good, very close to the Grand Place. There are lots of restaurants and bars nearby. It’s an easy walk from Bruxelles Centrale station.",negative
"Nothing.,

Fantastic location opposite cloth hall. Very comfy bed and pillows. Excellent food in the restaurant in the evening and breakfast was varied and very good quality. Great coffe machine. Parking in locked garage an added bonus.",positive
"The sink in our room was blocked and the water flooded in the room. The lady unclogged it with a product, but the problem should be solved in a more permanent way. Since the restaurant closes on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, there was no breakfast on Tuesday.,

Beautiful large rooms, large bath, restaurant on spot, nice breakfast, nice location",positive
"One of the biggest things that I dislike is the room service as I call the reception to bring me some items such as a Tissue, Towels, and bathropes, they told me to come down to grap these items as per the hotel's policy (6 points). ,

1- Location :
Nice location, it is really good if you think to be out of the city center a bit and close to a clean area. You can take the Metro to Shuman Stop for about 10 minutes and then 5 minutes walking to the hotel. The hotel also is really close to the European Union Commission (8.5 points).
2- Staff:
Respectful and friendly staff , especially the French gentleman Mr. Eric who assisted us a lot in discovering attractions in Brussels and facilitated how to move around the city (9.5 points).
3- Cleanliness & Quietness:
The room and bathroom are clean; however, the wallpaper has some scratches in some areas. The room and hallways are quiet (7.5 points).
4- Room Size & View :
The size of the rooms are very decent as we got a nice room with a fabulous view across the fountains. (10 points).
5- Amenities:
 The hotel is very modern as the reception desk is located in the middle of the lobby. It also has a nice snack bar with coffee maker. The bar named WXYZ has conformable seats for those who care about drinks or just chatting. Furthermore, the hotel has a nice gym where you can find the most basic machines ""Time Fitness"" and dumbbells. Baer in mind that there is no swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room, or souna (8 points). 
6- Price:
I have booked this hotel with an affordable price and it's worth staying (9 points). 
7- Service Level:
One of the biggest things that I dislike is the room service as I call the reception to bring me some items such as a Tissue, Towels, and bathropes, they told me to come down to grap all these items as per the hotel's policy (6 points). 
Overall, (8.3 points).",positive
"There wasn’t hot water running in the morning and unfortunately the points earned for having a his and hers sink in the bathroom were lost because they were both broken (one was leaking on the floor and the other was clogged).,

Very modern hotel, beds are very comfortable, room is spacious",positive
Every things is ok,positive
"Big personal lockers, big rooms",positive
"Maybe it requires some TLC.,

The description of the Hotel is very correct. No frills hotel in the historic centre of Ghent and the right price when compared to other hotels in the centre of Ghent. We had a rather spacious room with bathroom at ground floor, the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast is basic but still ok. Everyone was very helpful and our room was quiet and cosy after turning on the heating.",negative

the atmosphere for the breakfast, the big spaces, the color of the bricks, the wide windows",positive
"We were received very warmly by the owners, they are very friendly and attentive to customers, the accommodation was very pleasant and we felt comfortable, that place is beautiful, we will definitely return.",positive

Fab property close to all the main sites in Leuven. Amazing hospitality from a super host. He even brought us to the train station after our stay. Breakfast was really fantastic. The house is really cool, great personality and loads of space. Really loved this place.",positive
"First, we have booked to be staying in this hotel and later we were warned that we were staying in ALMA hotel. The location is very good, similar to the one booked. However the room was not that good. We have paid for a large room with (king premuum, whatever that means) and the room arquitecture didnt make any sense. During the evening, the curtains couldn't close all the light and there was a lot of noise. Besides we could have stayed in Hilton or NH for less or the same price. First time this happens when booking with Booking, I must say.,

Its location and breakfast.",negative
"Wonderful location, perfect stay, highly recommend this jewel in beautiful Ypres.",positive
What a poor experience. No one there at all to greet us for our stay in the hotel at 15:00 Very rude man offered no apologies for this. Whole place empty and felt very concerned about staying in a remote area just the two of us in this empty place.,negative

Very friendly staff. Very nice & comfy room. Quiet even next to elevator.Choice of good mocktails.",positive
"The drain in our shower was very slow which resulted in standing water.  When we requested help to fix it, the front desk said the would send someone to look at it but no one came.,

The parking was easy and convenient.  The location was perfect for walking to restaurants, the old town, and historic sites.",positive
"Bring your own towel, and there is no free shampoo/soap either,

One of the best hostels I stayed in, combining modern and convenient design with proper hostel soul.  The female room for 6 was huge and quiet. It had a separate entrance space with lockers, so you could handle your stuff before entering into the main room and making noise. Lockers inside the room (and storage!) were spacious and coded so very convenient. Beds are ok. Showers/toilets area is not very big so I was surprised that I didn't see any queues there, but I stayed only one night. Breakfast is basic but good. The common/breakfast/bar area is cool. The hostel had elevators and seemed wheelchair friendly.",positive
"Excellent room (23) and breakfast, I like the old-fashioned and cosy, low-level profile of this hotel. Very friendly staff, feeling as being home.",positive
"No kitchen facilities to use. Couldn’t make a hot drink. Showers in one bathroom not able to be used. Not very homely. Probably more suited to large sports/school groups,

"The breakfast was super - delicious scrambled ages and great selection. Location was very central and lunch in the restaurant was excellent. Would definitely recommend.",positive
"We received an email a few nights before that the restaurant was fully booked by a group the night we would stay. When I called and explained we were hiking to the location, they made room for us and we were able to eat the set menu selected by the group. It was beautifully presented and delicious. We were very happy they could accommodate us this way.",positive

Lots to like about this place, the room we were in was huge, and the added extras were really appreciated, especially the speakers so we could listen to our own music.",positive
"Nothing really.,

Close to the centre so parking is easy enough.",positive

"Fab breakfast and really cozy breakfast/bar room
Personal touch with maps etc",positive
"Breakfast was a little bit insufficient but it was ok. ,

Location is good, staffs are good, rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, plugs are enough for everyone. There are lockers for each guests, but you have to put 1€ to lock and when you use it you can get back. Everything was ok. I really recommend it.",positive

Comfortable property, good location at reasonable cost",positive
"Nothing,

The breakfast was amazing above and beyond, the location was perfect. Really appreciated the lockers and the amount of free space within the room. HIGHLY recommend :)",positive
"Very good location, gave me good memories",positive
"bed was bit smaller in size.,

The room and washroom were clean.",positive
"I am fairly tall (1.96) and the bed was a bit short for me, I had my feet sticking out. Fairly minor point though as this is the case in most hotels.,

Breakfast was delicious with fresh products, surroundings are beautiful, you don't hear the highway nearby, very cozy and relaxing styling, great bath tub with good water temperature and a very nice host with knowledge of the area.",positive
It had air con and felt like a home.,positive
"The shower is a bit oddly positioined, so you do get the floor of the bathroom a bit wet.,

The hotel's location is amazing, just one block away from Grand Place. The rooms are spacious and everything is clean. Great value for money! We got a corner room on the 5th floor and it had a great view.The breakfast is good. The staff was very friendly! There is a parking lot less than two blocks away from the hotel (Interparking). I would definitely stay there again.",positive
Location right in the centre of Ieper.  Could not be better.,positive
"The cleanliness, the contact & welcome and the propriety in general",positive
"Breakfast is very modest, no hot dishes etc. This category hotel should serve better breafast. And when I wanted to check out, morning stuff tried to tell me that they gave 25 Euro deposit (which I paid by card) to some stranger woman in cash and tried to tell me that it is normal, because she had some receipt on my name. It was very unpleasant...,

Room is spacious, bed is comfortable, almost all the room was clean (except night table).",positive
"At the end we forgot some important items after checking out, but we were informed straight away after leaving the premises and that speaks very well for their honest staff. Very good service.",positive
"Small toilets for a full floor.,

Nice terrace. electronic lockers in rooms.",positive
"This is an old building so during my stay, when people walked up and down the stairs, it was kinda loud at night. ,

The staffs I met were super super nice and really helped a lot. The breakfast was small but great. Moreover, the location is also one of the reasons that I highly recommend this hotel.",positive
"The best breakfast I have ever seen in a hostel, good selection of bread, fruits, etc...juice machine, coffee machine, amazing!
10 out of 10",positive
Ms Hilde was very kind and welcoming and the house is decorated in impeccable style. The breakfast is fresh and home-made and the rooms are very cosy and warm.

"Nothing.  Everything was great!,

Wonderful attention to detail.
Really thoughtful.
Breakfast was exceptional.",positive
"No tea making facilities,

The hotel is very basic and functional, the room was ok, breakfast was adequate, there was nothing unpleasant about it but nothing particularly nice or worthy of recommendation. A dependable budget option in a very central location.",negative

Beautiful hotel, great location and great staff. Faultless",positive
"We booked this from the USA Looking for a place to stay near the Henri-Chapelle WWII American veterans cemetery. Nobody was there when we arrived. Luckily our taxi cab driver stayed and contacted a person who came. Next, the facility is advertised as having a restaurant, however, because it was the holiday, the restaurant was closed. Luckily again, the person who came Took us to a restaurant several miles away for evening dinner after we visited the cemetery then arranged for a ride to take us back to the place. It all worked out, but started out scary with the taxi driver driving around forever unable to locate the place, and causing us undue stress limiting our precious time at the cemetery.  I took out my map that I had printed from home and noticed he had driven past the street more than once. I told him so. In the end he reduced the taximeter from 65 Euro to 20, the amount we were quoted as needing from the train station. This was not a good experience but by the grace of God turned out. The taxi driver’s wife returned in the morning to pick us up and take us to the train station. In my opinion and according to others, the taxi driver certainly knew where he was to take us and was trying to soak us for more money Unconcerned that we were there to go to the cemetery. Sad how these people think they can get away with that when they see  foreign travelers.  The motel lady said the driver certainly knew where her place was, but if she knew we were coming, why wasn’t she there when we arrived?  This was a bad experience, And only turned out by the grace of God. If we ever return, we won’t be staying there. Do you blame on us?,

It is Nice, neat and clean.",negative
"Nothing,

Spacious, the bed was comfortable",positive
"Would have been good to know the car park was not included in the price quoted on booking.com
,

Great location and very friendly staff. Good we could use the hotel car park",positive
"A bit noisy at night outside which may affect your sleep, but they do provide ear plug.,

Cheap, walking distance from major attraction",positive
"A VERY minor thing. No coffee making facilities in room.,

Excellent location and price.",positive
"We asked for the double room, but still two twin beds were given. The beds were quite uncomfortable and also the triangle roof is very close to your head, so be careful while getting up from the bed. Regarding the shower, you need to push the button every 7-10 seconds for the constant water flow.,

The location was very good for the value. It is close to all main sights, so you do not need to use any kind of transport. The breakfast was very basic but alright: toasts, eggs, nutella, jams, etc. The twin room was clean and good size.",positive
"Excellent host,",positive
very hospitable host!,positive
"Location was excellent, staff very friendly.",positive
"Nothing,this Hotel could not be bettered,

The hotel far exceeded our expectations,we had stayed previously some years ago but not since it has been renovated.The staff were incredible ,always smiling and nothing was too much trouble.There is secure  undercover parking a short walk away for a charge of €10.(we were on a Motor cycle)The room was immaculate and spotlessly clean.Well  soundproofed despite there being a huge big wheel in front of our room we couldn’t hear a thing nor the sound of the bell on the cloth Hall .The bed was big and very comfy and the bathroom was well equipped with a really good shower and plenty of toiletries.We ate in the restaurant ,the food was delicious and good quality as was the breakfast,every taste was catered for.The location couldn’t be better for anyone wishing to attend the Menin Gate.",positive
"Level of cleanliness has gone down compared to three years ago. There were grimes on my door of the loo and lift. Carpet started to run down. There were some dirt on the bench.Corridor and the foyer of each floor was way too dark.,

The members of staff are always very helpful and friendly - this is the only thing about this hotel that hasn't changed over the years! They are very good at problem solving!Excellent location - extremely safe and comfortable area. well connected with metro and major sight seeing spots. It remains very close to central station. Highly recommended it to anyone who prefers not living right in the middle of the very busy center of Brussels.",positive
"Just the one member of staff who checked us in. My son is in a wheelchair and on check in she happily just pointed me in the direction of the stairs that go up to the lift. She failed to inform me that if I went a different way there is a ramp we could take to the lift. Very very unhelpful. ,

The hotel has an old charm 
The location was good for station and not too far to walk in to the main tourist areas 
Breakfast was ok (maybe a little freshen up of things would have helped) 
Apart from the member of staff at check in, everyone else was very nice.",positive
"Clean, bright and big rooms with electronic lockers near center of old city. Good simple design. Breakfast with coffee and sandwiches.",positive
"Double-bed was actually 2 singles pushed together - which is a pet hate of mine.  En-suite bathroom needed some repair and smelled of damp.,

Reception was very friendly and offered some useful tips on the local area.  Breakfast was very nice.  WIFI was fast enough to watch TV via my laptop.  The hotel is located close enough to the centre of town to have easy access to restaurants and shops, but also located down a quiet road so that there is no noise from traffic.",positive
"The staffs are really enthusiastic to make your stay happy. The room, toilet,and shower room are very clean. The hostel itself is very convinient to walk to the Grand Palace. Because I needed to check out very early and would missed out the brrakfast time, the staff was so generous to pack me the breakfast on that night. Overall, my stay here was really amazing and I wish I could somehow got to extend my stay here :)",positive
"It was quite warm when we were there so a fan in the room would have been nice and the pillows were very squishy which is not my taste (this is personal though others may prefer this), however these are minor issues and didn't detract from the fact we had a brilliant stay here.,

Hildy was an excellent host. Very friendly and did the most amazing breakfasts for us! The room was really clean and comfortable and the bathroom was large with a very good shower.",positive
"The place is very clean and has everything you need. Cosy apartment, comfortable bed and delicious breakfast. Totally recommended.",positive
"Parking cost €18.00 for the night. Grout was falling out in places in the bathroom. Was also difficult to control the temperature of the water in the shower. Hot was nearly boiling! The bed was missing a foot on one corner and was very hard,

Breakfast was good.",negative
Great location,positive
"New, good and conveniently located hotel with decent breakfast offer. Recommended.",positive
"Nothing.,

The location was excellent on the inner ring road around the old town. A few local eateries for lunch and dinner, but better choice in the centre - a ten minute walk away.",positive
"Shared bathrooms are not always very clean and the showers automatically switch off after a few seconds. Not only I thought this time was too short (you had to press it many times in a row to clean off shampoo or soap) but the temperature regulation was also not very good (it became boiling hot whenever someone else was taking a shower and then freezing when they weren’t).,

Location, common areas and room were all amazing, one of the nicest I’ve ever seen!",positive
"The room we were in could use a little upgrade as everything was rather old.,

Good location, friendly people, and nice breakfast.",positive
"Poor breakfast (there is not a single ham slice), toilets were dirty, you have to dress your own bed and towels are not included (6 euros for a towel!).,

The location is very good. Friendly staff.",positive
"Nothing,

Beautiful property and host",positive
"Nice house, comfortable room, good breakfast, extremely kind and helpful hosts",positive
"Unfortunately, we were given the ""attic"" room so the bathtub was so narrow and difficult for someone to shower properly. They could have given us a better room as there were 3 of us.,

The location is fantastic! Just minutes away from the Central Station and Grand Market. The room was very clean and they use Rituals bath products which are great and our beds are made up well with clean towels. Unfortunately, we were given the ""attic"" room so the bathtub was so narrow and difficult for someone to shower properly. I notice the bathrooms in the middle next to our room is more spacious and normal sized if not bigger. So I feel very shortchanged by this as I was booked for several nights and they could've have given me a better size room esp I was travelling with my wife and child. Besides that I would stay here because of it's location and the tour booking company is literally next door - so it's very convenient.",negative
"all good,

Very friendly staff, and the room was spacious and very comfortable. Location is excellent. We didn't eat in the restaurant apart from breakfast which was good. For 10 euro a day you can reserve secure covered parking a 5 minute walk away, this has to be reserved in advance and is worth it.",positive
"Overpriced breakfast, better move next door to Exki. ,

Very comfortable room and bed. Location is perfect. Friendly staff.",positive
"Missing regulation of the heater,

Perfect position at 10' wolking distance from the city centre. Good breakfast",positive
"Shower entrance area could  have a hook & shelf to put your items. I wasnt to keen on water going on & off in shower, took so much longer.,

Staff were so friendly & helpful. Breakfast was great. Dorm rooms were spacious, loved the locker system. Good location. H
Visited the bar one night & live entertainment downstairs, wonderful vibe!",positive
"Nice hotel in the historical center. Simple but very atmospheric breakfasts (cozy interior and music in the buffet).,

The room was a humid and not ventilated well, as a result there's a bad smell of the carpet and in the bathroom some smell of moisture",positive
"Great hostel! Very clean, spacious room, wonderful breakfast included! Very good location, close to the Central Station 5mins by walking and the center.Totally recommended!!",positive
"Everything was good but i think with current facilities the price for a room was a bit too high.,

Very good hotel located in quiet area, perfect to rest. Breakfast was good. Kitchen where you can grab everything you need and big living room downstairs for everyone are making it feel like home. The hotel host is always friendly and ready to help with anything.",positive

"Could have better breakfast, awful coffee.,

Location in city, relatevly quiet rooms.",negative
Brilliant location with great views from room. Very big comfortable bed. Lovely friendly staff especially the lady sorting the breakfast room.,positive
"The kettle in the room smelt vinegary where it had been descaled and even though I boiled it a few times I couldn't get rid of the smell/taste. To be honest I forgot to report it to reception and it didn't in any way affect my enjoyment.,

The hotel was in a good location with lots of accessibly transport to central Brussels. There were lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance. The bed was so comfy and the room was more than adequate and spacious. Having a hairdryer and iron in the room was handy. The staff were friendly and helpful and the bar area was a nice place to relax.",positive
"the very strong air freshener in lobby, old & dusty bear & floral arrangements, sink in our room leaked onto floor in bathroom,

location to city center (5 min walk) & to metro/train station (15 min walk), 2 sinks in bathroom, windows that open, staff very nice & accommodating.!",positive
"The hostel is located on top of a local bar. So if you're staying at the the 1st floor, you can still hear the music from downstairs.
No free soap in the shower room.,

With the Snuffel bar being so cheap and popular amongst the locals, you can actually Interact with one or few of the young locals.
Plus you can save some money for booze as it's cheaper to have it at Snuffel.
It's a walking distance to everything you want to see in Brugge, with the laundromat and bus stop to Brugge station just a few metres away from Snuffel. So practical. You get to set your own locker code, so it feels safer. The staff is so friendly and helpful, and they can help u open ur locker in case u forgot ur passcode (it happens haha).
The place itself is cute and quaint. Some corners are even suitable for Instagram posts.",positive
"On the other side, the quality of wc is not as expected. Water is leaking and needs some renovation.We expect also the room with a large bed but there were two small beds laid together, therefore, the lying was not so comfortable.,

The hotel receptionist is very friendly and helpful. Otherwise, the breakfast and coffee  was good",positive
"ventilation - could smell the other guests,

Staff very helpful, breakfast great, taxi back to bus prompt with staff helping to call and accomodating due to bathroom shower on the floor being our of order.",positive
"We had quite some flies in the room, but that will get solved soon as the owner will put screens on all opening windows, so that will be solved fast.,

Nice room, nice bathroom, the owner is very friendly and makes you feel at home.  Mi casa es su casa.  Breakfast with a large variety of cheeses, meats, preserves, ... and when the sun shines, breakfast is served outside on the terrace (unfortunately when we were there, weather was not so good). Environment is great for hiking, the owner showed us a very nice one which we did.",positive

"You have pay for towels.,

The room was very big and had separate space for lockers. The spacious room meant there was more privacy. Loved the common areas as well",positive
"I would suggest they change their room lock system, sometimes the traditional key system can be a bit unreliable. I closed the door and found it was open later on. But if you are a bit careful you will be perfect.,

The room is truly simple, yet very cute, clean and has that little town feeling, doesn't seem old but nicely well kept. The bathroom was entirely new so very nice. Breakfast is really nice and thanks to the side door to access the side of the building I was staying at I felt like i had my own place, loved that.",positive
"Very dirty. Dusty. Seems like room was not cleaned after previous guest,

central locationfriendly stuff",positive

The size of the room. The available amenities. The location by the rail.",positive
"The smell of incense in the lobby was too much. It was overwhelming and almost physically hard to breathe through such a thick perfumey smell.  In fact it almost gagged me every time I had to pass through.I also wish there was a way to get through the lobby to room 122 without going up and down 3 flights of stairs, it was exhausting.,

Breakfast was plentiful and varied.  Loved the chocolate eggs!The room was nicely laid out.",positive
"It was clean, spacious and well organized.",positive
"Bathroom didn't have heater, so it was too cold.",negative

The breakfast was great! Hilde made it really tasty! If there was something, you could ask her anything. The rooms and the bathroom were beautiful, even the kitchen, the living room,...a very charming house. I totally loved it! The view was great, we were lucky that it just snowed. There is also parking, nothing negative to say! Great stay! I would recommend it to everyone :) GroetjesAnnelies & Anthony",positive
"Very friendly Host, location is great, breakfast was VERY good, room is clean and very nice. One of the best place in Leuven and really nice to avoid Brussels high costs.",positive
"I actually enjoyed everything, maybe one small sugestion is to introduce some juices or water for breakfast, they only have coffee and tea (or maybe I didn't see it).,

This is my favourite place to stay in Brussels from now on! Its location is absolutely great (just behind the Grand Place), it has really comfortable and nice rooms (I guess it was refurbished pretty recently), breakfast is good and varied and staff is very kind. Compared to many places to stay in Brussels in this price range and with the same number of stars, I would definitely choose it.",positive

shower and light,negative
"We enjoyed the stay at La-Gotale, the pleasant hospitality of Hilda, the beautiful landscape around, the huge house which designed perfectly by Hilda (Charming and also an Architect), the tasty and colored breakfasts each morning were joyful for all of us, especially to the kids which were excited with the brown morning ;)The house itself is very comfortable, besides our room facilities, there is the big living room for all guests, with fruits, coffee and tea bar.For travelers, cycling or walking, the location is amazing, also for families but if the kids getting hungry after getting back home, take under consideration that you will need to drive about 30 minutes to find open restaurant (burgers, pizza, cafe, ice-cream.. etc.).",positive
Very nice host. Makes a big difference vs anonymous hotels.,positive
"Nothing, it was everything good.,

The staff are very friendly, super comfortable and clean room, breakfast with a good variety of food, and location is amazing, just behind of the Grand Place. Lovely hotel in general.

This hotel is very central and has been upgraded in the last two years. I had a room overlooking the Flanders Museum Building and the Square. The bathroom had an excellent shower and they provided an excellent breakfast which was included in the price of the room.,positive
Very clean and comfy.  The room was bigger than I expected and (unlike many other hotels) the king size bed was actually king size.  All in all a very pleasant experience.,positive

The hotel was fantastic. Staff were excellent and very knowledgeable of the area which helped us get around Brussels with ease. The room was excellent, clean, spacious and very comfortable. The shower was nice to use after a long day and the bed was comfortable for a good night sleep. 
Very modern throughout and even had a pool table and table football in the lobby.

"Few bathrooms and they are not flexible about check-in and check-out hours even when there is no other person in the bed.,

The breakfast is really good and the rooms are very quiet and clean. You do not need to pay extra fees if you need to leave the luggage a little bit longer in the hostel. The hostel has a bar and a really nice kitchen.",positive

Staff are really friendly and speak both French and English so very easy to communicate. There is a nice bar in the hotel to get drinks such as cocktails if you want.",positive
"Awesome location & bar in the lobby — if your evening is lazy, a nice selection of local drinks makes a good company. Hot water is a bit hard to get, but still a great deal for its price :)",positive

"For us it was perfect, but it is roadside and Im not sure how much there is to do locally for a longer stay,

We stopped off at the Hostellerie on the way back to the Netherlands from France so we could break up the journey, but we ended up having an absolutely lovely end to our trip. A beautiful property in pretty grounds with top service, excellent beer and a first class restaurant. Would recommend to anyone in the area.",positive
The location is perfect. I had a room facing the street and it was nevertheless very calm. Contact with the staff worked very smoothly by email. I would recommend this structure!,positive

How nice it was to be able to bring our dog. THE FOOD WAS EXQUISITE. The hosts are lovely people. Professionals!!! Great spacy room.",positive
"It‘s easy, trendy, clean and comfortable. The location near all the hipster bars and restaurants is top rate, yet situated in a tranquille street",positive
"Their motto is ""From work sesh to gem sesh"" which really sums it up: this is more a concept than a hotel. They are re-inventing something or other in a more trendy start-uppish way and it is as comfortable as living in an app. The check-in  area is gloomy and there is a large, dark empty space behind it which make you feel you arrived at a deserted warehouse. The room was not clean (euphemism for stains on the floor), and it was divided to two adjoining sections which made each exactly just a little bit too small. The free WI-Fi does not support apps such as whatsapp or google maps, so it's basically useless. One more thing: if you need a taxi, book your own.  The company they work with proved to be unreliable. Given the option I will not stay in an Aloft hotel again.,

The large owl on the wall might look scary but it is very friendly.",positive
"The decor in the hallways is a bit tatty but this is a minor thing,

Amazing comfortable bed, lovely cosy room with a great view accross the city. Hotel is ideally located for everything you want to see in Gent. Breakfast was delicious!",positive

The refrigerator was very spacious although there was no freezer. The staff was readily available for any questions or concerns. The apartment had a bedroom with a double bed and the living room had a large comfortable pullout couch and a daybed. For those who like baths unfortunately there is no bathtub in the bathroom. I would definitely recommend this place to future travelers.",positive

Very nice hotel in good position, close to the sea and centre of city.",positive
"New owners, beautifully decorated with lots of little extras and details. Good food and plenty of safe carpark, will recommend !!",positive
"As a new place, a few things missing from room like iron and board, furniture to eat at on balcony, toaster and kettle (these are downstairs though.)  The breakfast bar could have been half depth cupboard to fit stools under as otherwise there was only a nice chair and desk to eat at. Odd when a kitchen most families would love to have is there but no table. The usual steep staircases would be tough for anyone with limited mobility or no fitness.,

Lovely modern newly refurbished suite with spacious separate toilet, good shower, comfortable bed and full new kitchen. Use of kitchen and communal seating downstairs also. Secure house with keypad entry. Parking for one car in front of their garage entrance. Otherwise,  seemed to be free on road parking overnight only. Nice fittings and quiet outlook at back, over little courtyard garden and rear of a quiet factory? We love walking and it was an easy 25mins for us to central sights.",positive

"Our room was poorly soundproofed, you could hear everything the neighbors next door were doing. 
We missed a little fridge or  water cooker in the room.,

We loved the very spacious rooms and the lovely furniture. Also had a big whirlpool bath, which was fun.
They also have a restaurant with fresh oysters and lobbster, which we tried! The food was very good and the service was very friendly, although we had some issues with the card, which was only in French. Would definitely recommend this place for a little romantic get away ❤️",positive
"Everything was perfectly cared for, but nobody around all day. For me this was absolutely fine (and there is also an emergency telephone number), but people needing personal assistance might wonder how to find help. There is a rather narrow staircase (and no lift) to the rooms in the upper floors. But again: everything is extremely well propper, tidy, quiet, well equipped. And it's a very quiet area at night hours.,

Eurocidatin lies near to the center of Ixelles, a lively spot inmid of Brussels. Bus connections towards the center are all fine (bus-stop for No. 71 is only 5 minutes walk, and the bus 71 takes you to the central station). There are quite a few interesting restaurants (from affordable to haute cuisine) and pubs around and the Flagey center with a highly interesting cultural program (cinema, classical music, pop, jazz, exhibitions). Good place to stay when you are in Bruxelles.",positive
Excellent staff. Perfect location. Great breakfast. Quiet and super clean room. Many thanks,positive
"The hotel needs some refurbishment but this did not make it unpleasant. Quite old fashioned facilities which may suit your taste or not. Very steep and narrow staircase which would be a challenge to anyone not fully steady on their feet.,

Staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful - always had a smile on their faces. I had a really big room with a massive bathroom. Location is reasonably central and only a ten minute walk to the castle area.",positive
Better than I expected it to be. Definitely recommend it.,positive
"Access stairs,no lift,

Clean modern bathroom and bedroom",positive
"Very nice place, I just love it.",positive
"The only thing missing was a dishwasher or at least a rack to dry the dishes (everything else was provided).  The area was quite calm, but it felt a bit isolated.,

Great host, the house offered everything one would need including games and DVDs. They even had bowl and a cushion for our dog. We also could regulate the temperature and the house was nice and warm.  The area was very calm and the garden was  easily accessible and closed all around (so we could let our dog without having to worry about her wandering into the street).",positive
Such friendly and helpful staff; fantastic location and great breakfast.,positive
"The pillows had lumps in them, no slippers. ,

The staff and the location.",positive
"The old house is quite noisy, so in our room we could hear the door bell from the restaurant ring each time a person entered or left.,

The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was wonderfully decorated and nicely spacious and the bath was an enjoyable bonus! The restaurant turned out a very pleasant surprise, with carefully prepared food (traditional French cuisine) and good wines, for a truly reasonable price, served in the nice atmosphere of the old house. Breakfast was delicious too, and we enjoyed watching the squirrels play in the trees while we ate the homemade bread, marmelade and local ham/cheese.Directly from the hotel premises, we made a beautiful hike along the Warche river and valley, to the Reinhardstein castle. The area is nicely quiet with hills, forests and fields. After the hike, we enjoyed a lovely local beer in the cosy hotel garden.",positive
"Everything perfect. The room was very clean, comfortable and quite. The building is newly renovated, rooms, furniture and bathrooms are absolutely new. Nice kitchen and common areas which can be used by all guests free of charge. Extremely easy and fast check-in/ check-out, the access instructions received in advance via e-mail were very clear and detailed. Excellent value for money, I would certainly recommend this place.",positive
Very clean and modern,positive

I was warmly welcomed by a person who even made the effort to speak a little bit of French, who gave me all the necessary information and a map of Bruges. Subsequently very discreet and cordial staff.
The room and the bathroom are quite big and clean. I couldn't hear any noise from the road thanks to the double window.",positive

Loved the room design",positive
"We couldnt sleep very well, because of other guests coming in the hotel in the late night. That made a lot of noise. We hear the noise of the stairs everytime. Room is not sound-proof.,

The room was very clean and bathroom .. the bed was beautifully made.. they give us shower & shampoo gel and soup. We liked the long windows and there was a beautiful romantic view from our window. The room was warm and cozy, warm blankets en soft pillow.Breakfast was amazing! I drink Hot chocolate milk and ate toast with cheese and ham.. i enjoyed the stay. Also very close to the tourist places.",positive
"Everything was good,

Cleanliness and price/quality",positive
"For the final floor of the hotel, rooms height are good but there is wooden block which supports the rooftop (ofc
it is usual and normal) which was in the room and as tall person (1.90+), i hit my head two times to there 😁 However, in general quality is good and i was happy for my stay.,

In general, it is clean and good quality hotel, with reasonable price and it is in good place because between center and train station. So, just after you go out from train station, you can reach to the hotel approximately 12 minutes of walk and from hotel you can reach to the center in 5 minutes. They have alot of things which can be needed for regular traveller such as cloth hangers, hair dryer, shampoo, soaps etc. We just suprised that there wasnt daily usage sandals (usually white color) but the floor was covered with carpet and it wasnt a problem.",positive
"Receptionist was unpleasant and in general staff not particularly friendly. Parking situation should have been explained in advance. I.e you can't approach hotel by car.,

The room was excellent, breakfast very generous and delicious.",positive

"Nothing,

I loved the breakfast !",positive
"Very welcoming staff, tasty food and the style of the hotel itself.",positive
The check in process was clear and easy,positive
"Room only had one type of curtain (to keep any light out). Great during the night but as there are other buildings really close you had to also close them during the day to avoid neighbors looking into the room. A second, thinner curtain would have helped. The hotel signature smell (perfume) was really strong in the lobby and after room service.,

Room was a great size, comfy bed, excellent wifi that worked the full 3 days after logging in once. Friendly staff. Liked the lobby/lounge/bar area which has different seating options and was a great place to do some work or have a beer.",positive
"I've found photos here a bit misleading - the room and bathroom didn't look that nice at all. Housekeeping could be improved and the sheets which are thorn should be thrown away... Also, the walls and doors are very thin - we could hear some guys rambling, talking loudly and slamming doors at 5:30 am when walking back and forth between the (shared, I guess) bathroom and room(s) for like an hour... There were some rain paddles on the rooftop/terrace, so we kept the windows closed during the day to keep mosquitos away, but housekeepers left them open every time which let plenty of mosquitos inside. Kind of annoying :(,

Seriously super friendly and helpful staff, especially Charlotte! Good location.",negative
"Everything unless breakfast and location,

Breakfast location",negative
"The absence of tea/coffee making facilities in room. The communal tea/coffee facility was out of order a couple of times.,

Excellent breakfast. Great location, 15 minute walk to station or town centre. Friendly staff.",positive
The weather was pretty bad and we headed to spa. Short note - spa is in another hotel so you’ll need to walk till there and change there. And bring your own slippers or you will need to pay 5 EUR per pair. It was surprising to me in 4 star hotel.,negative
"Everything was perfect 
And .... super breakfast . In those Covid times it’s rare enough to be said 
Host was super nice and kind 
Definitely the place to be in this area",positive

I love the way how they decorated the hotel and room.",positive
"WiFi was not good because of the thick walls of the building but if you want to unplug it’s perfect. ,

The place was lovely, set in an old abbey I believe. You should opt to eat here as the food is fantastic and fresh each day. Staff, family run, were very nice and helpful. It’s in a good location to explore the region and was good to come back to hotel for a great dinner each night. The location is just outside Malmedy so you need a car or bicycle to visit town center.",positive
"I realised too late that there was a room next to the kitchen, so I felt bad about not making less noise when I had my breakfast at 7 AM.,

Very clean and modern, nice neighbourhood",positive
Staff were helpful & nice,positive

There is not more to write then simply perfect, well organized and super breakfast prepared by the lady of the house.",positive
"Nothing at all!,

Excellent house in beautiful surroundings. There are other houses nearby, but it doesn’t affect the privacy and it is perfectly calm and quiet. The landlady was brilliant and I am sorry that our stay there was only a one-night detour, while on a trip, rather than a one-week holiday to explore the beautiful Maas valley.",positive
"Room rather small and no view from the window. Struggled to get the air con to work. Needed more people to clear up at breakfast ,

Location superb and rooms clean and comfortable",positive

breakfast was great, room super clean and everything as expected",positive
Very close to all.We could walk to most places. Plenty of resturants with good selection of food.,positive
"Parking a problem and most roads leading to hotel are now one-way which my sat-nav had no idea about.The hotel itself is in a very poor condition. It is clearly very old with lots of wonky floors and a winding staircase which is difficult to get suitcases up but my main complaint was was the state of our room. The decor hasn't been touched in a very long time and the electrics - well - I was so worried we would be electrocuted. The toilet cistern was not attached to the wall and the whole place felt grubby.,

The staff were lovely. The bed was clean and comfy. Hotel ideally situated for centre of Ghent.",positive
"Shower room is annoying 
You have to constantly press the button to keep water running
I understand this is to save water but at least make it longer
There’re no sign or anything say which way is toilet or shower room,

Location is good 10 mins walk from Brussels central but the entrance is bit pain as you need to detour around building.
Breakfast is ok but no meat at all(ham,sausages)",negative
"The bathroom was badly designed, awkward to get past the toilet into the shower.  The radiator next to the sink was rusty. ,

Good selection at breakfast.  Good parking.  Good location.",positive
"The air con came on by itself at 3am waking us up and the room smelled a little of dogs. 
Renovation work at the moment made it a little dangerous at night. ,

Great location for restaurants, etc. Easy to get to Bruges or the Ferry port. 
Really nice breakfast and comfortable beds.",positive
"Absolutely loved our stay here! Really friendly, welcoming owners. We arrived after a rainy day in Bruges, and Jos and Babs lit the fire in the lounge and served us some wine and a snack plate which was greatly appreciated! The room is comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. The area is peaceful and a lovely break from the city and the animals are lovely - some beautiful horses and a very funny sheep that yells to be petted! Breakfast was also delicious, and way more food and choice than we would have expected. We will be back!",positive
"All is perfect and well organized,

The beautiful environment and the wonderful hospitality for welcoming me although it was almost midnight. Great breakfast and beautiful talks early morning.GreetingsMark",positive
The host met us for a late arrival - thank you!,positive

The standard of the hotel was better than expected last bed every month nite of the stay",positive
Good location!!,positive
"Air con would be nice in hotter weather,

Super service from helpful and efficient staffClean and fresh",positive
Breakfast of 3 items is difficult to understand. The price of the food itself probably plays minor role in the total cost. So why to have this complicated system?,positive
"A bedside table (with charging point) for every bed would be nice,

The beds were really comfortable and it's in the centre, walking distance to all the things you want to see/do in Ghent",positive
Amazing location,positive
"No tea / coffee making facilities in the room and the coffee machine in the hall was not working on the last day. Just a minor thing but these things happen.,

Excellent. I would hope to stay there again in the near future. Clean, comfortable and only a few minutes walk to the main square. Plenty of venues for all types of food nearby, whatever your taste. Secure parking on site was a big bonus.",positive
Breakfast was very good - buffet. Short walk to the beach. In pedestrian zone which makes arriving and departing difficult if you have a lot of luggage. Parking available offsite for a fee,positive
The staff so helpful and friendly. The property immaculate and interesting,positive
"Nothing,

nice place to stay! Friendly staff, spacious garden with cozy indoor swimming poor, deserve your money and visit!",positive
"Lovely bungalow, lots of space and very comfortable. This was a quick stop on the journey to Italy, and it was lovely to make ourselves feel at home for the night.",positive
"Overall the hotel is fantastic value for money, and its location in the Grote Market is location, location!The breakfast was far more Han we could have expected, however perhaps a little background music would make the breakfast room more personal.Our only regret is that we only booked one nightThe Hotel Regina is **** luxury at *** costWe will certainly be returning next year",positive
Top location for the price,positive
"Nothing to complain about other than being a bit too far from the town centre.Restuarant did seem expensive,

Staff were great and really helpful being able to arrange taxis at short notice.Excellent service during afternoon & evening at the outside seating areasOff-road parking and relatively quiet locationClean + comfortable room",positive
"Wonderful room with excellent facilities, good design, great shower",positive
"Plastic on the beds. Easy to remove though, and housekeeping got the message so they did not put it on again when I left.,

Breakfast was quite nice. Served in a separate room, warm fresh bread rolls and simple garments. If you do not expect anything fancy (which you shouldnt when paying this price) you'll have quite a nice experience. For a one star hotel, it's actually quite nice.",positive
"The breakfast is just ok. Not much to choose from,

It’s a typical hostel. Everything there is new and looks nice. The beds are quite comfortable, there is only one table in the room (we stayed in a room for 4)",positive
"The staff were really helpful for disabled guests, they ensured a parking space was available and the room was both suitable and near the car for access.",positive
The Japanse garden did not look cared. Very unussual for a Japanese garden 😏,positive

Nice, clean, well rounded business hotel. Friendly staff, always willing to help and assist. Comfortable beds and nice shower. The room is quite big, compared with many other hotels in Brussels.  Stylish and in a good location for the European Quarter.",positive

Denis is a seriously good chef and is in the process of making quite a name for himself and good luck to him.This is a very charming small family run hotel.",positive
"2 of the entrance doors were locked 'for security purposes'. I think that's really cheeky even for a 3-star hotel... parking is a little expensive too, seeing it's so tight :),

Great location, great value-for-money little hotel",positive
"Despite stating that parking was available...it isn't. We were shown the streets where free parking on a Sunday evening was but it was obvious that you couldn't park there. The streets were too narrow. Where we did park we received a parking ticket at 8pm on a Sunday evening. Talk about keen ! 
The hotel is more of a hostel than a hotel ,

Good central location. Good staff. Good breakfast",negative

beautiful place! full of amazing climate! wonderful views from the window. very clean and homey. the hosts very helpful! Thank you very much and we will visit you again with pleasure,positive
"Unfortunately the fire alarm went off at 130am and was a false alarm. Our 8 year old with us who has special needs, was most upset and couldn’t get back to sleep after. These things happen but I do believe they have a new fire system and we were made away by staff when we checked in that it had been going off earlier. So was disappointing that it had not be sorted.,

Lovely hotel, fantastic rooms huge bathroom. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was superb. Great location too. Would definitely stay again.",positive

Excellent food, way above any expectation for this type of accommodation, the manager is evidently a highly trained chef and uses lots of local produce. My steak was as good as anything I've had in an expensive city restaurant. Recommended.",positive

Breakfast was great.",negative
"Beds and bedding seemed old.,

The location and the size of the rooms were great.",negative
"I have nothing to complain on because everything was great!,

The location of this place is very convenient - it's almost on the seaside. If you need parking, I would recommend taking ""Indigo - Parking Zeedijk"" - it's located just over the corner (though the price for 1 day there is 25 EUR - the same as Indigo Kursaal / Centrumparking, which is overpriced from my point of view). The staff in the hotel was very friendly (both - at reception and in the dining area). Anti-coronavirus measures are everywhere and when I entered my room there was a huge bottle of sanitizer on the table. The room was clean, quite cozy, with a kettle, coffee machine, and a mini-fridge. That was a very comfortable stay and I can surely recommend this hotel to everyone.",positive

"The accomodation is not very clean, smells funny and there was a lot of dust in our room. We booked a room with a large 2 pers. bed, but instead we got a room with separate beds. The separate shower looked old, a bit dirty and not very comfortable.,

The location of Hotel Flandria is perfect. Very near to the old center of the beautiful city of Gent.  It's a five minute walk from the parking (EUR 15 p/n) and maybe 2 minutes walking from the old churches. At check-in the staff was very friendly",negative

Great service and very good food at the restaurant.,positive
"When we entered the hotel for check out, there were 4 people working in the reception. We approached and nobody payed attention to us, so I said that we would like to check in. One of the ladies said that somebody will attend to us shortly, which was strange, because there were 4 staff members chatting between themselves and no other guests except us. 2 minutes later the 5th staff member approached and I now tend to think that she was a trainee - that's probably why we were asked to wait for her specifically. It really seemed like she wasn't experienced, because she didn't mention all the necessary things, but the most outrageous is that when we asked her if the breakfast was included, she said ""Yes"". The next morning we went to have breakfast, and then we were checking out. The same lady told us the amount and that we need to pay extra for the breakfast! When I asked her why she told me otherwise yesterday, she just shrugged her shoulders and didn't even apologise.,

Nice room with a very comfortable bed. Very clean, good location, great value for money.",positive

To access the locker you need a euro coin something i wasn't informed about before. I did not have a coin and the person out rightly said ""we dont expect people to come here wothout money, you cant access the locker"" this was at 10:30 in the night when it was raining outside.

"The room and bathroom layout was not super practical. For example, when you open the door, you directly walk into the side of the closet and in the bathroom there is not enough place to put cosmetics and shower products.
What was really disappointing, is that the hotel closes at 10pm and there is no receptionist till early morning. You can enter the hotel with the room card but the first night of our stay it broke down (the system to swipe the card) and we could not enter the hotel with other guests for almost an hour. Even more disappointing is the fact that we did not receive any apology from the management which is unacceptable for a 4 starts hotel.,

The host manages to make you feel welcome even when you cannot  see them. The location itself is wonderfull and very nicely decorated. The Location of the Gite itself is absolute great for people who want to do nice hikes or visit the center. (Routeyou : bouillon 6 + city walk are advised) Nothing to remark.",positive
"The room could be a bit warmer but it is difficult to totally heat the old buildings. It was not cold but rather lukewarm😉,

Very friendly welcome. Sparkling clean. Location is great, still central but off the tourist path! Furnished nicely",positive

Location, good for the price we paid.",negative
"Without a car some places a difficult to reach (but that's typical for the Ardennes).,

The gite is a little outside of the centre of Bouillon. It's quite and serene. Multiple hiking trails start just at the entrance of the door. The host is very kind and comes over whenever you need something. You can also see in the gite that he is very ecological. There are for example fresh herbs outside of the gite and the heating is with pallets.",positive

"I have nothing to complain about. ,

I travel a lot every year due to work (more than 20 hotels each year) - but this place was a true retreat, a little paradise that I didn't expect.
Very kind staff (almost like visiting friends), beautiful (huge!!) room that shows real taste, 100% clean, very good breakfast.
The building is an old farm that was renovated from top to bottom and furnished so nicely. All seems absolutely new and very well taken care of.
For me this was just another business trip - but I think I will have to come back for vacation! This place is worth it. 
Thank you guys very much for this experience!!",positive

The location (at the river) and the facilities (barbecue). It was all very nice!,positive
"Only thing I'd change is have low power night light for toilet, as frosted glass door, tho' stylish and lovely, left bedroom a bit too illuminated during night visits. Not a problem for everybody tho' :D,

They've thought of everything, just bring yourself! Fridge, kettle , toaster, coffee maker, iron...Lovely breakfast -enough for lunch too, there's even a sandwich bag. Mini-bar really reasonably priced, cheaper to drink apéritif before going out. Could eat in with salad or microwave meal. Lovely stylish furnishings including dining/breakfast table, sofa & desk.Great location. Lovely friendly hosts. BBC on telly. Secure.Spacious garage only 15 Euro per day, a minute away, even has charging for electric cars.Felt really special especially after disappointing stay elsewhere in previous days.",positive

"Very stylish place, nice peaceful location",positive
"Nothing to dislike,

The way in which this former farmhouse has been turned into a beautiful B&B is impressive. The family room was very big, including a large bathroom. The eye for detail in the tasteful decoration in the house can be seen everywhere. You just feel the warmth and love of the owners for the place and for the guests. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the best part was the friendly and hartwarming conversation with the owners during breakfast. The B&B is located in a peaceful small village but close to the highway for easy connection by car to many places in Belgium. The price/quality was excellent! Would love to return in winter time to enjoy the cosy looking living room and read a book by the fireplace after a walk.",positive

Restaurants nearby and close to central station.",negative
"As in many hotels, unfortunately there were no tea/ coffee making facilities in rooms, and we do like a cuppa! But the fact that there was a reasonably priced bar, including hot drinks meant that it wasn't too bad!,

Friendly staff, very happy to speak English. Comfortable rooms. Good breakfast buffet. Also there was a bar, including hot drinks, manned by the Reception staff. One of our rooms even had a view of the Cathedral!",positive

"We got an upgrade to hotel Messayne so we did not stay in Square hotel. The rating apply to the upgrade, that was a nice surprise.",positive
"Very small bed. The walls in the stairway are literally falling apart because of mold in the plasterwork.  The doors are super old so you can hear everything on the hallway and viceversa. Also we figured the location was good but the road next to it is very noisy.,

"The breakfast was not as I expected. It was small with few things. It is the only one negative thing I could find during my journey.,

The atmosphere and the position aree great. You can easily reach different important places in few minutes (the grand place is only 10 minutes by foot). There are different restaurants around for everyone. The room and bathrooms are clean.",positive
"There was no square view (as in the picture in booking.com), the room was on the back. There was smell from the downstairs kitchen entering from the windows, although we were on the third floor. Finally, the air conditioning (which we turned off) had a problem, there was a water drop every 30 seconds falling on the floor (since it was night, we did not ask for assistance,, that I am sure would have been provided, but we put a trash bin to collect the water and a blanket to limit the noise). I am sure the problem was fixed afterwards, but not quite the top for a superior room.,

Comfortable beds, big room, perfectly clean. Staff was nice and welcoming.",negative

Extra points that I could bring mine !",positive
"Quirky apartment in the top of the building. Very friendly helpful staff; We were able to use the garage to store our bikes.",positive
"Restaurant prices way too high to be tempted. Even drinks seemed double others nearby (eg cava glass 9 Euros vs 4.50 down the road). Bathroom beautifully renovated but let down slightly by uncleaned dirty brown bacteria buildup around sink plug hole. Half screen shower design means the bathroom floor gets soaked.,

Location is good. Breakfast options limited but OK. Parking available offsite.",positive

"Edith was a very friendly hostess and served a great breakfast.  We stayed in a family room on the first floor which had plenty space to move around in.  There is a large communal bathroom on the first floor. The garden had enough seating for all the guests.  The guests also have access to a large, very well equipped kitchen.  Our small dog was most welcome.  We also enjoyed the large games rooms equipped with a snooker and soccer table.",positive

"NOTHING ,

The location was good and very central. The property was exceptionally clean throughout. Benny was always friendly and there to help at all times. Breakfast was marvellous, with fresh and different items everyday. Definitely B&B Bariseele in Bruges is the best property we had in many years abroad. Surely we will visit this place again shortly. Thank you Benny.",positive
"I didn't get the best room, I'm sure there were better rooms and I couldn't be bothered to change it.,

Seemed fairly nice, just near to the centre of the city. Room was alright, definitely around a 3 star standard.",positive
"The room had a terrible smell of drains and the air conditioning did not work. We reported this to the receptionist. She said it was the first they had had this reported. However after reading reviews from this hotel it appears that you’re a few customers had complained. It was a known problem for the hotel. We were only offered a glass of fizz to say sorry as they could not move us. Our room smelt badly we had to sleep with the window open on a ground floor which was very noisy. Our room was in an annex away from the hotel. The air conditioning did not work. We had a very unpleasant stay and would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I believe a glass of fizz was a pathetic apology.,

Location",negative
"No sink with the toilet and shower/bath was difficult to use. There were also no curtains or netting in the bathroom. This is fine but it should have been clearer when booking. Although there is parking, it is only for 2 hours before you have to change the parking permit so not very practical if away. Although we did feel secure, there was possible access into the locked rooms via lift. ,

Spacious rooms that were well furnished. Everything was very clean and peaceful location outside the main city but with good transport availability.",positive

Great location. Fantastic communication with the owner.",positive
"My wife has a back condition and is thus used to sleep on hard to very hard support -> the bed was slightly too soft for her (so for people who need hard matrasses, ask the hosts for another room than 6). Breakfast was nice indeed, although served on a tray, it is not as diverse as expected. Real orange juice would have been better.From an environmental point of view, I would suggest to put soap and shampoo in dispensers in the bathroom instead of all these individual packages.,

The location is just exceptional. The room was big enough and very clean. The coffee corner is an excellent idea and the cookies were tasty. The hosts were dedicated to our wellbeing and very amiable. I found the bed very comfy.",positive

"It's the third time we come to Dinant and that we stay at Apartment Jules & Jim, we love everything 😊",positive
"The rooms are rather old-fashioned, and appear to be undergoing a rolling refurbishment. Rather reminiscent of French hotels circa 1980. However, the place is charming, the staff are lovely and it is spotlessly clean. It is also very well-located, just a few minutes from the centre of Gent.",positive
Exactly what I expected. Incredible hosts,positive

The property was lovely and clean, not a bad location, had a few shops close by which was handy. It was modern looking!",positive

"late evening could not reach property by phone,

helpful staff",positive
"The house has a good potential but needs renovation and more accurate cleaning.,

It is a good place to stop on the way to Han-sur-Lesse Caves. You will share the bathroom and the kitchen with the rest of the guests and the host. She is welcoming, friendly and does her best to be discreet.",positive
Really central location. Nice modern big apartment.,positive
"Our hotel room did not have running water. Even after multiple reports, nothing was done about this.",negative
"Nothing I can think of!,

The proprietor Benny is a very gracious host. B&B Bariseele was everything we had expected. The breakfast was without a doubt the best we have ever had at any B&B we have stayed at, anywhere. The location is about a 10 minute walk to the heart of Bruges, as well as some of the more suburban areas of the city. We highly recommend B&B Bariseele!",positive

Nothing",positive
"The parking lot is not the greatest.  It’s off a Main Street and the entrance is very narrow.  I damaged my vehicle trying to pull into the parking lot.  I would definitely recommend parking offsite.  Additionally, the shower was not very clean.  There is hair still in the drain and some of the towels were very badly stained.,

Great location for walking to the most popular tour sites and the Markt Center.  Very comfortable room for families.",negative

Lovely room and excellent breakfast,positive
"Not a negative, just a note - it's a family house turned into BnB therefore the sound isolation is not the top one. But if you get quiet neighbors, then it's excellent!,

The location and the host was excellent. There are great walks around and it's a short drive from bigger interest points. . The place has a kitchen with all equipment you need to make dinner and you can enjoy it in the garden that is available for use. And dogs are welcome!",positive
"No view of the riverboards (if terrace, at the back). The bed is really hard, not recommended for back sufferers! Stairs to do when you're not located on the ground floor.,

At arrival you have to call a gsm-number.  A friendly lady gives you the key-code of the house, the same of your apartment. There are 4 apartments: 1 on the ground floor, 2 on the 1st floor with terrace on the back and 1 on top (the largest without terrace). The proprietor is an art-gallery owner who's gallery is located next door. This house is designed in style with old furniture.",positive

Just the most welcoming of any B&B, we immediately felt like we were staying with good friends...peaceful, beautifully decorated and extra large rooms and bathrooms.

A nice house in a beautiful and quiet village.",positive
"It certainly wasn't the fault of the hosts that we were having a heat wave at the time.  But it was very difficult to sleep at night due to the temperature in the apartment.  There was no air conditioning, and no fans available.  We left the windows open, which didn't help much and also allowed in a lot of noise from the street.  We weren't expecting air conditioning but some fans would have helped.,

Excellent location right in the heart of Dinant, next to the main attractions and restaurants.  Good wi-fi, nice kitchen and bathroom facilities, lovely back garden.  Although there was no parking available on the property, free street parking was available nearby.",positive

"I was meeting family for a surprise for my father. My parents arrived first and the person on the check-in desk completely gave away the surprise and when I arrived told me my parents were already there. Absolutely no regard for guest privacy. There was mould and chipped paint on most of the windows in the room and bathroom. I was looking under the bed on checking out in case anything had rolled under and found rubbish belonging, I assume, to a previous guest.,

The bed was very comfortable and the location was convenient. The person checking me out was very friendly and pleasant.",negative

Breakfast was first classStaff very helpfulLocation, only a 10 minute walk into the center",positive
"I had the room out in the carpark and it was really cold. There was a gap under the door that wasn't covered by the curtains and all the cold air and noise was slipping in through there. The heater was working as per thermostat settings but since the bunk bed was closed towards the heater, and the gap was right near the bed.. it wasn't enough. Also, due to the huge interesting bunk bed, there was no space in the room.
The water from the bath tap was hot but wouldn't come hotter to make a decent bath. By the time the bath filled the water had cooled due to not being hot enough. Was okay for a shower though, but we were already really cold and needed to warm up and the bedroom wasn't helping us either.. unfortunately whoever designed this room didn't think the space properly because there was so much space down in the bathroom and nice and warm that I'd had rather slept in there than in the cold and tight bunk bed room above.,

The bedroom had an interesting design.. on 2 levels.. with a huge bunk bed as you walk in and the bathroom on the ground level, right under the bed. One can play with the light in the bathroom and makes it even more interesting. 
Hotel was close to the market and the train station too.",negative

Excellent breakfast - a bonus was the little kitchen with free tea and coffee and a small kitchenette with microwave. Complementary home made cakes and biscuits  is a lovely touch. Also drinks in good fridge on an honesty basis is a very good idea. I was able to rent a room electric cool box for 2 euros per day for my Cava!!",positive
"The bathroom smelled a bit upon our arrival and the shower needs some fixing but at least the water was warm. The bed takes some getting used to (it has a hard mattress).,

Fantastic location right in the center of Dinant. Great appartment: roomy, clean, warm, nicely decorated, has all comfort including a dishwasher and a coffee machine.The owners were nice. There's a map with nearby hikes on the wall.",positive
"Trying to find it do to misunderstanding. Took tram one as instructed then followed instructions. Only problem the large church at kornmarkt stop is not the cathedral but a very impressive CHURCH so wandered around in circles for quite some time. The hotel is near the CATHEDRAL,

A cute ,basic hotel. Liked it a lot. Wish there were more simple budget places like this. Breakfast was good. A very positive experience",positive

I highly recommend this hotel! Stayed for 2 days. Everthing was perfect!,positive
"Nothing,

Friendly and helpful staff, clean bedrooms, nice breakfast, great location! Certainly I would stay here again. I needed to print my boarding pass and they did that for free. They deserve 5 stars.",positive
Excellent continental breakfast. Other facilities are on a honesty box basis. Good parking and the set up means you have the room without being fussed over unless you require anything.,positive
"The shower room fittings need a little maintenance (many were loose and the lights over the shower didn’t work properly). This would be very easy to resolve. Otherwise perfect.,

Charming, well equipped and very well positioned apartment.",positive

Too pricey!!!!,

The locatio is excellent!
The sataff is extremely polite and helpful!!",negative
"Having to leave, both the Bariseele and Bruges....,

Had a wonderful stay, room was a really good size with everything we needed while the neighbourhood was very quiet. Our host Benny was very attentive and put on a really good breakfast every morning with lots of locally sourced produce and even bespoke waffles and pancakes :) He answered all our questions and set us up well for the day whatever plans we had, which was much appreciated. Highly recommended.",positive
"Parking might be a bit awkward, although we had no problems. Limited choice of restaurants in Kortrijk.,

Great location, really helpful staff, ideal base for cycling in Flanders",positive
"Very friendly Reception, parking places at Hotel, modern Interieur, close to City centre",positive
It was really quiet and comfy I couldn’t have choose a better place to stay,positive
"Perhaps only the stairs to the top floor but little else! I would blame the current Euro exchange rate for not giving it a top value rating!,

The friendliness of the staff and proprietors. The handsome beauty of De Haan and the ambiance of the hotel building, the cleanliness, the car parking, the garden, the honesty bar and many other things contributing towards a very pleasant stay. Also it's not far from the E40, for trips to Bruges, Ghent and beyond.",positive
"For future visitors - the location and value for money is great. VERY IMPORTANT: contact the host by phone about half an hour before your arrival, because there's no reception desk or anything of the like. A basic knowledge of French will also be helpful. Enjoy!",positive
"Can be a bit noisy-no carpets to absorb noise,

Comfortable beds, attentive staff, great delicious breakfast, convenient location,",positive
"Everything was perfect, starting from the delicious breakfast, amazing and comfortable room, impeccable staff, and perfect location in the historic city center. Benny was an incredible host!
If one day we return to Brugge, for sure we’re gonna stay in B&B Bariseele!",positive
"It's a really good quality ghotel for the price and the star rating. Staff attentive, rooms good, sufficiently spacious and clean / well maintained.",positive
"The hotel is on a busy one way road with no street parking and they keep the gate to the car park closed. You have to park up the car to get a code to park the car and once you have the code you have to drive all the way round again. They should let you know before hand and maybe send you the code if you have reserved parking before hand.,

The location",negative

Spacious and warm.,positive
"The cleaning service is terrible. They didn't clean the garbage can for us though it was already full. They also forgot to give us clean towels. Additionally, we suffered greatly from the sensor light in the bathroom. It was totally dark when we were taking shower inside the bathroom. Many equipments was too old to use, and the toilet was almost broken.,

The staff at the reception was very cute and nice.",negative

Good honesty bar & breakfast great location",negative
"We Tried calling ahead of time but language was a barrier. We accidentally saw another couple arriving and the owner going inside with them. After approaching him we were able to go to our room but it was very stressful not knowing what to do. Shower water flow was very poor and there was  mould on grouting.,

Apartment was spacious and comfortable. Coffee machine very good. We left our bags as we arrived earlier than expected.",positive
"Odd room and floor configurations but not unexpected in Europe with a small operation. Bathroom was very very narrow and hard to manage in. I""m a tiny person and I was cramped. It was obviously carved out of space in the bedroom but other than that shower was great, good pressure and lots of hot water.  No elevators and narrow winding stairs on second level that were fine for us as very fit people but I think older or less able travelers may have trouble navigating.,

The young man at front desk was extremely friendly, helpful and efficient. It's a small hotel with good sound proofing. Our room had a very large window that opened which is always a bonus. If you like character in your accommodations and a good price this hotel will appeal to you. A small bar area, no bells and whistles but fine for us as that's not the type of travelers we are.",positive
"It didn’t worry us but there are a few stairs up to the top floor but very quiet up there with a nice view of the church!,

Very tastefully decorated, spacious and a delicious breakfast choice, with a chance to sit and chat to Benny and guests in the dining room on weekends. Easy walks to explore the UNESCO old Brugge!",positive
Perfect as a base for a cycling weekend. Very good buffet breakfast with eggs cooked as required.,positive
"Very lumpy uncomfortable pillows, luckily we brought our own. Unable to turn off bathroom light. Music left on in courtyard garden all night and we had one of the rooms just off the courtyard so we were kept awake. My partner went to the reception area and used the telephone to call the manager who came back to turn off the music - apparently a 20 minute journey for him. Then the music gets turned on again at 8am waking us up! We were charged a fee for parking and also a city tax which we paid in cash when we checked in. We were then asked for this when we checked out. Luckily they have cameras so I told them to check them as proof that I had paid the fee! There is a horrible drain like smell in the foyer which is covered up (partly) by a really strong air freshener. ,

Rooms were very clean and made up each day. Parking area was secure. Breakfast was good and there was a coffee machine available for use at any time, along with a vending machine for snacks and essentials.",negative
"Staff was lovely, the hotel was very nice and clean, it exceeded our expectations!",positive
"Perfect location in the center of town. Very nice apartment and very clean. They provided coffee, creamer, sugar, tea. Nice patio in back. Parking was easy and close on underground lot, had to pay for a few daytime  hours but overnight was free.",positive

Location was very central and in a quiet area. The breakfast was limited but adequate.",positive
"Bed was uncomfortable, room wasn’t very clean. Extremely limited services. Got attitude from staff when I asked for water",negative
"Check-in times very limited (16-17 h).  I had to renounce to a boat trip to Dinant because I would have arrived only at 19:00 then.When I arrived I was told on Sunday that the front door lock had been broken the day before and could only be fixed on Monday, so everyone could walk into the house until then. But until I left on Wednesday it was not fixed.,

Perfect location in city centre, marvelous terrace (apartment's own terrace plus joint sun terrace for all 3 apartments), shops and restaurants within walking distance, The inhouse decoration  has a special character (retro), and personal decoration items are present (e.g. retro objects, books).River views.",positive
"Thin walls, a bit run down,

Very good location",positive
"The host !I called beforehand to say I was going to arrive there late, after calling 4 times someone finally picked up.When I arrived at the property I couldn't get in. Was not told the door code. Was not told what room I was in. Called many times. No-one answered.I spent 1 hour in the hallway trying to get in. Eventually other guests saw me and said they had the same problem so randomly took a room.2 hours after I'd arrived, the owner finally got in touch. His answer was ''oh well at least you didn't wait too long, I was having dinner with friends, this is not a hotel'', this was at almost 10pm, I had a race the next day, with an early start.So very, very rude.,

The location was good.",positive
"- have to carry luggage through narrow stairs and walkway to the room,

Nice and cosy studio, well situated. It was really easy to get the keys, we just called and someone came immediately.",positive

"N/A,

Very cosy and excellent location",positive
Front door lock to the apartment you could not lock from the outside (faulty electronic lock) and the back French doors to the back courtyard could not be locked and one door had a broken hinge which meant that the apartment was totally insecure whilst I was out. Fix those two issues and it's a great place to stay.,positive
"The lack of good WiFi signal throughout the entire apartment. The water pressure in the bathroom was low, the late check in time. ,

The sunroof, the spacious apartment, the very central location of the apartment, the cleanliness.",positive
"The apartment was spacious, beautifully decorated with kitchen facilities and room to relax. The outside area was just lovely. So central to everrythig and so quiet. The perfect place to discover Dinant.",positive

Location is perfect",positive
"All is good, only there is a snoring roommate, but that is hostel.,

I like basically everything in the Bruegel Hostel. The bed has light and electric outlet for each. The bathroom is clean. There are lockers in the room. And they use card to enter the room, which is very safe. Most importantly, the breakfast is terrific! It's the best hostel I've stayed so far! And it's only several minutes walk to central station and the Grand Place.",positive

Location, breakfast",positive
Great hotel right in the center of Minsk with close proximity to the Old Town as well as the railway station. The biggest shopping center in Minsk is just outside the door of Minsk hotel.,positive

"I can't think of anything... It was really perfect,

A beautiful premise with an amazing and kind hostess. The place is gorgeous, very well located (right in the center of Brussels) and the accommodations are top notch.I can't think of a single thing that could be improved, even the specific measures against Covid are well thought and efficient.Would come back again anytime ! Thanks a lot Vinciane :)",positive

"I am receiving a message from Booking that I owe an additional ~50 USD.  there is no explanation why.  I cannot call the hotel as no one answers my call.,

Please Everything was fine",positive
"But, the breakfast was deplorable, there was so soap at the bathroom. The interior was not very homey, but good enough. It tried to be a hip place from the decorations but failed in my opinion.,

On the plus side, the hostel is in a great location and they let us store the bags until check-in.",negative
"I guess nothing. Only that the during my previous stay I had a bigger room, but that's not important.,

Probably everything. The staff person was very friendly and helpful. Very personal approach as well, feels very cosy there. The breakfast was great too.  And the location is nice - you are next to everything in the center of Brussels.",positive
Triple room is so small and not suitable for 3 people.,negative
"So pleased to be able to have a night away for our special wedding anniversary despite the Corona restrictions. So few special hotels are open, particularly mid week. Dinner and Breakfast were served in our room and were both well presented and lovely. The staff were fully accommodating and welcoming, the hotel itself has lots of charm and character and has a great location in the city.",positive

very tidy room; modern and functional equipment; very friendly personnel; central location;",positive

We immediately experienced the perfect and friendly service, upon arriving at the Hotel. 
The staff offered great flexibility for the in-room dining, as well as serving a range of nice and tasty dishes.",positive
"Slightly dated. Furniture is ""old hotel style"". Reduced number of Reception staff (due to COVID-19? ). ,

Very friendly staff. Excellent location. Had an amazing view over the main city Square.  Shower hot and powerful. Bed comfortable. It was nice and hot in the room while outside was -18!",positive
"biit noisy,

clean",positive
"Not comfiest beds or bedding, no air con,

Decent breakfast- hot drinks etc, good shower",positive
"The main things to consider before booking this boutique hotel are the fairly strict conditions in comparison with larger city centre hotels, in particular a 30-day cancellation policy and little flexibility of the timing of your check-in, as staff is only present at breakfast and during certain hours of the afternoon to receive new guests. The premises are fully covered by CCTV. If you can live with those restrictions, and if you don't mind climbing stairs, then you will have an absolutely wonderful stay.Perhaps a small point of improvement might be the stability of the Wifi connection in the top floor suite, but the network connectivity in the common area was excellent.,

Loved the smell of freshly baked croissants every morning, as well as the overall help-yourself-at-any-time attitude of this boutique hotel, which does indeed make it an ""all in one"" experience. Coming home from work, you can make yourself a coffee or choose from a range of exquisite teas, and there will be some cookies and cake to accompany your beverage, which you enjoy in a beautiful salon with art on the walls and glossy magazines.A special thanks to staff, who noticed within two minutes of my departure that I had forgotten my laptop in the room and took the trouble of reaching me on mobile to ensure I wouldn't leave without it. A personal touch that exemplifies the bliss of staying in a small boutique hotel with caring hosts.",positive
"Excellent service in this charming hotel at the center of Bruges. In these times of Covid, we were able to enjoy a delicious 3 course meal in our rooms and felt almost like being at a restaurant. The rooms were very cosy and fully equipped. We had a nice Easter gift assortment of chocolates waiting for us as well. Can only imagine how nice the tea time or restaurant would have been. The breakfast in the morning was also delicious. Overall, a great night to escape the daily routine. We were with our 3 year old and newborn baby and it was enjoyable all together. Definitely recommend! Location is also perfect for sightseeing and a big thanks to the staff who was always available and going beyond their duties.",positive
"Everything was perfect and met our expectations. From the service, cleanest and locstion",positive

We enjoy the bath in room. 
Very clean place, and sympathy of the owner.",positive
"Beds were a little too soft,

Breakfast was good, staff was perfect",positive
"Food options are quite limited, especially if you arrive in the evening, on weekends, like we did. The hostel pub only has drinks, some little snack would be  useful.The double room, gorund floor, only has some upper windows, if you want some light in, then people walking outside could look directly into your bed,

Fair distance to the subway station, nice pub with friendly staff, big bathroom for the private room",negative
It was my fourth stay - and every time was excellent.,positive
"Destination of hotel was perfect, but remained incredibly quiet in the evening. The staff were helpful and prepared the room beautifully for a surprise birthday weekend. They were as accommodating as possible with food and drink arrangements despite not being able to use the bar or restaurant area. Wonderful breakfast.

"Location. It’s a very busy street with no view to the sea which I think can be found at similar prices, but near any important spots. The there’s also no parking so you have to be a bit lucky to park near the hotel. Bed was ok but a bit uncomfortable. ,

The hotel was spot clean, and room as well. The breakfast was well served and you could order many different things instead of a huge buffet which I always find such a waste. On the overall it was a positive experience.",positive
"It was clean, the bedsheets were free breakfast was included. It was quite close to the city Center. Would definitely stay here again",positive
Very friendly and helpful staff. Also great position and comfy room.,positive

"What a wonderful house with a beautiful ambience of a lovely family. It was a very comfortable space to do some coaching work and superb location to Parc Josaphat nearby for some walks with my clients and evening exercise.The house is extremely well equipped and with the changeable weather I used both the log fire and the outdoor garden. It is such a bonus to be able to rent a location where many of the basics are available to use (tea, coffee, oil, salt etc) and have the trams, a Carrefour, bank and Pharmacy very close by. It was made special by the care and attention to detail I received by Sophie on arrival.  Thank you for the hospitality.",positive
I loved everything about this house.  The host was great and met us and provided lots of information.  The kitchen is very well stocked.  He even left a few beers for us to drink!  There was plenty of space for our family and all beds are comfortable.  It is nicely decorated and very clean.  Would love to return.,positive

"the rooms and hotel are modern. the beds were great, bathroom clean. it was a bit warm but we overlooked the airco system (our fault :)). a pity that the window cannot be put on ""kip stand"" - would help to refresh it a bit. breakfast was great, staff was friendly.",positive
"The sheets were a little bit dirty. 
The people from other rooms were making a lot of noises at night, although it was a rule for no noise after 10 PM.  ,

The location, it was near supermarkets, bus station. 
The fact that it had a vending machine with water at 1€. Great deal.",positive
"Highly recommended!! Vinciane was so generous to upgrade us to the apartment on top floor. Although there is no lift it is worth the stairs....spotless clean, kitchen with all ameneties and toiletries provided. We also found a free bottle of champagne and an aroma diffuser as a gift! So sweet! And Alison is the best! Very helpful always smiling and hard-working! Breakfast was nice although it could have some more variation such as eggs and fruits. Location was super...but not if you don't won't to spend money ;) as it is in the centre of a long street filled with shops. perfect for women :D walking distance to all atttactions",positive

"The Alain apartment was simply gorgeous. Ideally located very close to the city center and a 10 minute walk from the railway station, La Suite de Carnes is a forth-floor apartment (no lift available) on two levels. On the lower level there are a well equipped kitchen, a wonderful and very well furnished living and dining area, with big sofas, a fireplace, stereo-bluetooth system, big screen tv, and a large bathroom with a rain shower and double bassin. On the loft there is a very comfortable king size bed. The entire apartment was perfectly clean. Alain is a very kind person and give you alla the informations about the city you need. I suggest to stay in the apartment for a minimum two nights to fully enjoy its athmosphere. We absolutely recommended this apartment.",positive
"Very friendly, clean and great breakfast",positive
"The elevator was out of service due maintenance and we were assigned a room at fourth floor.
Is 15 mns walk from the center,

Would recommend this place to everyone going to Brussels.",positive
"Super staff, super location, amazing room.",positive
"Breakfast could have been a little better, even during Covid season",positive
"The bed had stains on the sheets. The bathroom had no drain so every time we showered there would be puddles on the floor 'til it basically evaporated on its own. Just your average breakfast of toast, jams and eggs. Lady staff was quite obnoxious.,

They had a very spacious double room. Location was perfect, pretty accessible to the city center. There was a safe deposit for your valuables in the room.",negative
"It's an older  - yet beautifuly restored - house: hence noise insulation isn't the best. Advisable to use slippers when walking around in your room on the wooden floor.,

The lady owner welcomed me in person despite me arriving only in the early evening. The breakfast is rated very high in reviews and rightly so! The hotel is conveniently located too.",positive
"There was no wifi in our room and no cell service either, which wasn't terrible since we were trying to get away from it all anyway!  It would have been nice to have coffee or tea in our room as it gets dark early and nothing is open due to COVID so we spend more time in the room than we normally would have.,

The room was large and nicely appointed - a small sitting area, a small table and chairs where we had our meals (which were delivered to our room), a very comfortable bed (and comfy pillows, which is a first for our travels in Europe!) and a large shower and separate toilet.  We booked the suite and it had a large sliding glass door that opened onto a small deck (it was too cold so we didn't sit outside).    The grounds were lovely, even in winter.  There was a path that led from the property and went around the lake, and there were secluded areas on the property where you could sit and take a meal or just relax.  The host and her family were very friendly and our dinner and breakfast were wonderful!  She didn't speak English and I only speak a little French but we figured everything out just fine!",positive
"We liked absolutely everything,

Ee would give this flat 10 with 5 plusses. The house is amazing with great technique equipment beds and everything of a good quality. The host knows how to please the guests. We enjoyed stay so much. Location is also perfect",positive
Awesome apartment in the centre of Namur. Had everything we needed. Alain the owner was very kind and gave us some good suggestions.,positive

"Not all the beds have power outlets close to them like other hostels,

The staff and the location of the hostel, they have laundry services and that was good",positive
"I stayed in a room where walls, bed linnen etc where all black. I’m not a big fan, but that is personal taste. I was afraid the room would be noisy, due to the busy street below, but that was ok.,

The location is great if you like shopping, eating or have to be in the neighbourhood. The best thing about the place is the huge living room/eating place where you can work and relax. The staff is friendly and efficient.",positive

"Nothing not to like: it was heavenly! ,

What an amazing stay we've had here! Beautiful room, great gigantic bed, fluffy robes and a big comfy bathtub. The staff was super friendly, very professional (especially with the new covid-rules) and very helpful. The breakfast was sublime - even without the buffet, because of covid again - and had a lot of gluten free options (thank you so much for that!). The hotel is practically next to the Gruuthuse museum and everything is at walking distance. We felt like Kings this midweek and returned home completely pampered and relaxed.",positive

This very attractive nice Hotel is in a great central location with parking.Was worried about being served a rubbish breakfast because of a C19 no buffet, but what we got was SPLENDID.The bar was very nice but too quiet like most of Bruges in general I guess.",positive

Very central location",positive

The lockers are big and easy to use. The location is great. Right between the old town and the museums/palace.",positive

"Little frustrating to have only one expensive option for breakfast. I wish hotels could simplify breakfast and the corresponding cost. But this applies to most hotels.,

A beautiful family run hotel in an excellent location. The staff were friendly and helpful.",positive
"Can't use the word ""cozy"" for the hotel. It's central, convenient. Room was good. But the ambiance is very ""soviet"" with high ceilings, dark leather and cold architecture. Surprisingly small elevator (then again, only one elevator was operational at the time).,

Great location, 10 minutes walk from the Minsk train station, about 40 minute drive from the airport. Excellent staff. Not sure how well-versed is the staff in English. Spoke to them in Russian. Very polite, courteous and attentive.",positive
"I did like there was heating in the room and worked
Buy a towel that is not new and you will leave it there for sur that you paye for 6euros.lol,

I liked the bedbugs. I didn't like the fact that no wifi was not working. They give vey little water to shower and hot water.

Very expensive for what it is.",negative

The surrounding was nice and everybody was very friendly. I could not sleep at all the first night because of the matrass, the owner gave me another room next day.",negative
"Very minor. Just a suggestion for more tea towels and to provide bags for the rubbish - both for under the sink and also the brown bags to put the rubbish out on the street on collection day.,

The house was lovely and the location was great. Book on site was helpful and Lander emailed a couple of times before we arrived to ask if we had any questionsNote we stayed with two young children and the house was fine. In terms of the stairs, we just closed the door when we were downstairs",positive

Nice decorated and very comfortable!

"No soap in the bathroom and thin walls. Pillow wasn’t that great either,

Nice staff, luggage room safe, room had private bathroom, value for money. Recommended",positive
"Lots of stairs which is a pain with big bags but that is the nature of inner city living. We were travelling for a month so had a fair bit of gear to deal with.,

Very central - easy access to the train to the Brussels Airport as we had an early departure. Great welcome - clearly a keen aesthetic sense as the property has some beautiful art, furniture and finishes. We will come back for longer next time.",positive

"Slightly out of town, but we enjoyed the walk in so this wasn’t an issue for us. The road the property is on leads you right to the centre. ,

Spacious compared to other properties. Large dining area. We didn’t use the garden due to the weather, but certainly would appreciate it if I was there in better weather. Large bathrooms. Easy to find. Decorated for Christmas which was a nice surprise.",positive
"No Towels included. Have to pay extra to get one.,

The entire hostel had a good atmosphere to it and there's a lot of activities to do (such as air hockey tables). The location was also convenient as there's a metro just 5 minutes away, but it was also around a 20 minute walk to the city center anyway.  Breakfast was included in the payment.
The staff was really helpful.",positive

We had a wonderful stay and wished we stayed longer",positive
"Our 2 night stay in Brussels turned out pretty catastrophic:( We arrived quite late and were given a room - with no working heating, and it was below zero outside, so room temperature must have been around 10 degrees or below... We weanted to change the room but were told that the hostel os overbooked. Next morning, frozen as hell we tried to change the room which turned into a joke. First room we were given was cold w/o heating, next one had ppl in it etc... Ths staff was pretty friendly but adamant about no refunds... I tried to argue that there should be a refund if they fail to deliver a basic service... In the end after like 1-2 hrs of hustling we were finally given a room with heating on. There was no heating in the shared bathroom though and the room was sloppily cleaned, but at that point we did not care... Bruegel was far from cheap a price close to a hotel without basic service top back it up. So worst stay ever unfortunately.... I never thought this can happen in an European capital - hostel without heating at winter time....,

The location is really good, close to all sights and next to a nice church.",negative
"Nice and clean...
I probably comming back!",positive
"-,

We liked everything! Newly renovated house on three floors, big and well-furnished kitchen, 2 bathrooms and one toilette. Great value for money! Perfect location, 10 min walk from train station and city centre. Quiet place, supermarket just around the corner. Perfectly clean house, confortable beds. Love it!",positive

Flor is the best host I’ve ever met, she take cares of every detail.
Absolutely I’ll back to this hotel!",positive
"Not a problem for us but if you can't manage stairs the main bedroom is 3 floors up and you may have difficulty if you have large suitcases. It would have been nice to have a washing machine and dryer. If you are short you may find it hard to reach some of the dishes on the shelves.,

A beautiful place to stay. Easy to access with the lock box to enter the house when we arrived as that was a lot easier for us than trying to agree on times as we were travelling and had no mobile phone access in Belgium.  Great not having to carry keys. Lots of room with the bedrooms on 3 floors and 2 bathrooms. Nice setting with the garden, lovely decor and easy walk into town with the car parked close by.  We were travelling with our adult children. Plenty of space for everyone to relax. Everything you needed in the kitchen. We didn't met our host but everything was emailed and no problem communicating this way as we got replies very quickly. Don't forget to print or keep the emailed instructions about how to access the house before you leave home. We would definitely recommend Blossom and Bloom as a place to stay in Bruges. We stayed for 3 nights and could have stayed longer.",positive
"The toilet generally smelled really funky, so it was good that the toilet and shower were separate. ,

The entire hostel had a good atmosphere to it and there's a lot of activities to do (such as air hockey tables). The location was also convenient as there's a metro just 5 minutes away, but it was also around a 20 minute walk to the city center anyway. There was a separate shower and toilet for the room I booked, so I could easily maintain the cleanliness. Breakfast was included in the payment and it generally had more choices than other breakfasts I've had in hostels. They also allow to store luggage after check out so you can still roam around before you leave the city.",positive
"Staff were really helpful, closed to central, I will recommend 100%",positive
"it was spacious very very clean. kitchen had everything we needed, pots and pans to tea and coffee. used the four hr parking card outside when we first got there later parked in the station car park for 2 days which costed us around 32 euros. was a 14 min walk back",positive
"We lived in a family room. Generally the room was fine, but it requires a renovation. Location is good - 10 minutes of walk to the city center, and 5 minutes walk to local big supermarket. Personnel is very fantastic! It feels like you come home to an old friend, rather than to a hotel.",positive
"The downstairs toilet needs a bit of a clean when we arrived, otherwise was perfect. ,

Clean, modern and spacious; bakery and butcher just across the road and a small supermarket close by; short walk to the centre",positive
"Nothing,

I liked owner' s welcoming attitude. She really made us feel at home. She also was ready with needed information to make our stay a wonderful experience.",positive

"Good location, friendly staff",positive
"Our room was a bit worn out (bad mattress, hole in curtains) and would need a little care.,

The owner was very friendly, dining room and the whole hotel beautifully decorated, hearty breakfast, great location.",positive
"The bedroom we chose was really tiny for a 3 night winter stay - we did not assume to be as tiny ..having the luggages and 2 people is not so easy. Small corner shelve, to store clothes and bathroom ‘door’ is not a door so it is like having the toilet in the room which we would not have preferred, other then that it was a nice stay with Fleur.,

A charming traditional house exactly at the entrance to Bruges centre, our host gave us loads of tips for our stay around the city. And breakfast was hearty and worth while to start off the day ❤️. Bedding was comfortable. And the host held our bags for the last day until we were ready to leave Bruge",positive
Fleur and her assistant were very welcoming and very friendly! The breakfast was delicious and there was good variety. Our room was cosy and nicely decorated. We were also close by to everything being a 10 minute walk from the Markt and still within decent walking decent of the station and other attractions!,positive
"This is our 2nd time staying in this Hotel.Great location. Near metro station. Underground shopping center. Bar, restaurant inside. Room is clean. Staff is friendly.",positive
"Slow process on reception,

Great location, walking distance to the heart of the Minsk and just next to underground. Decent breakfast. Bath. View to the square from the window",positive
The very friendly welcome late in the evening and the the dinner that followed. The latter is not so common in smaller hotels and B&B's. So I highly appreciated this aspect. Rooms well furbished and very clean. Last but not least a good wine recommendation to go with the food I was served.,positive
"The shared bathroom wasn't very comfy to use. If you don't need a complete shower and you just need to wash you feet - was a challenge to handle. I didn't have a on premises breakfast, but a take a way package instead as i had to leave very early, so i can objectively judge. But the breakfast package could be a way better compared to what i've got.,

I arrived very late in the evening. The staff on the reception was very friendly and helpful. As i have to leave at 6 am i was offered a breakfast package instead of a regular breakfast. The facilities were ok aside that the whole night, including the early morning people were entering/exiting the room as i spend the night in a dorm room. The room has its own sink and big lockers working with a coin. It looked clean. The hostel is at a walking distance from the downtown and the Gare du Midi",positive
"At nights entrance is dark. ,

It’s feeling nostalgic",positive
"I would have liked to stay a few days more.,

The Quality of the service.  The cleanliness, the breakfast was exquisite; providing a large selection of meats, cheese, breads, home made jams, and the presentation was absolutely beautiful. Overall the quality for the money that was paid was excellent.",positive
"Nothing really.,

Good bar in the basement. Breakfast.",negative
The property had a very central location and was very clean. Staff were very pleasant and spoke very good English. The room was lovely and spacious.,positive
"Everything was perfect,

The flat was newly remodeled, very clean and comfortable, the kitchen was very well equipped with a microwave, stove/oven, plenty of dishes etc.- the owners left us a large bottle of water in the fridge, coffee pods and tea, even beautiful yellow roses in a vase on the table! The owners were very gracious and responded very promptly to our emails. We will definitely stay here if we go back to Liège. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",positive
"Nothing to mention. The little things are hugely outweighed by the positives. Most windows cannot be open by design but heating/cooling very efficient.,

Very nice owners, greatly equipped villa with a nice garden, the outside jacuzzi and inside sauna are the perfect finishing touches. Close to nice places, possibility of delivery from nearby restaurants.",positive
"English visitors might prefer a kettle rather than a coffee maker to make tea,

Warm welcome from owners.",positive
"Separate toilet but the only shower was an ensuite which is awkward for the guests on top floor. 
Steep stairs may be difficult for some.
Tiny terrace so no outdoor space if that's an issue,

Spotlessly clean. Small kitchenette but full of everything required for self-catering.
Games, books etc and comfy furniture.
Excellent location for walking into Bruges",positive
"This place is fantastic! The hosts are so nice and welcoming, and both food and room is great! Definitely coming back.",positive
"Only one shower room on the first floor, and no container for putting stuffs& weird shower head in shower room,

Common Area on the first floor and wifi",positive
"The restaurant might serve more more dishes from the region, but it is available nearby. Also the breakfast price (14 EUR) is a bit too much. I would prefer shower cabin from the bath tub, but those were different times...,

Located in the very centre of the city, old-style hotel (in good sense) with all facilities needed. 24/7 open bar.",positive
"The apartment was very clean, it had soft beds, nice view from the terrace and it was easy to reach. Very friendly hosts!",positive
"Nothing.
If we want to be picky same as last year Tv setup in the bedroom needs to be replicated in the front room.,

Everything what is there not to like? Beautiful house and furnished amazing! See you next year 👌🏻",positive
"I prefer to have a kettle in the kitchen but there is a coffee maker. ,

Rooms were comfortable and clean. Good heating and hot water, really good shower.",positive
"The property was advertised as having 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom with a hot tub when in fact there was no bathroom only a shower and sink within the main bedroom. This caused major problems for us as we were a group of 4 adults who all needed the use of the shower and sink which could not happen when the bedroom was in use.
The 2nd bedroom is in the attic this is fine for children but being an adult of 6ft meant every time I got out of bed my head banged into the eaves of the wall. This bedroom did not have a wardrobe this was situated on the 1st floor landing which meant coming up and down stairs when clothes were needed.
The property was advertised as having a balcony with city views and a terrace unfortunately this was again incorrect as there is no balcony at this property and the terrace was tiny and was filled with plant pots you could not sit outside. I feel let down as the advertisement for the property sounded great but without these facilities our stay was not comfortable. ,

The welcome we got when we arrive was lovely.
The property was about a 10 minute walk from the centre. 
The downstairs of the house was lovely a great little kitchen with all you needed for your stay. The sitting area was big enough for 4 adults and was comfortable. 
The use if 2 bikes was a nice touch although we did not use them.
If you are a family with young children then this house would be nice for you but a group of adults just doesn't work with out a separate bathroom.",negative
"Nothing.,

The room was immaculate, beautifully decorated, very comfy bed. Breakfast was amazing, so much choice and beautifully presented. The owners were helpful and friendly, enjoyed a chat, and happy to help with anything. Would definitely recommend it, best B&B we have stayed in, we will definitely return.",positive
"Not sure why, but the staff was a bit... unfriendly.,

Superb location, spacious room, clean bathroom. Beds OK, breakfast OK.",positive
"The room decor is very outdated, needs some works to refresh the design as you feel like returning back to USSR.,

Overall experience is great, location is very central, breakfast a bit too expensive for Belarus but good quality (there are plenty more affordable places for breakfast, lunch and dinner). Everything is clean and has all needed.",positive
We very much appreciated the coffee and tea which were included in the price. We also liked very much walking in the neighbourhood with our children. The appartment was well equipped and comfortable and our hosts were extremely kind and friendly.,positive

"It's not a well kept hostel as the perfect one we were in Amsterdam (""stayokey"") the common area is poor not even water, the bed in room is shakey and the blanket and pillow low quality however the heating was good and we had a good night sleep, the windows wasn't soundproof lots of noise from the street,

Good heating system, good location, friendly staff, it was ok for our needs we got at 20:00 and left at 530 morning, very basic",positive
"Flies around the breakfast food!,

Pristine room, very well presented hotel with friendly staff at the front desk. Late checkout is free until 1400.",positive
"Fantastic stay at Hotel de Castillion. Superb location close to sights of Bruges. Although it was very busy outside, you step into the hotel and the atmosphere is calm, quiet and relaxing. Beds and furnishing were very comfortable and the room was a good size with great facilities. We had a warm welcome from staff and we look forward to visiting again.",positive
Place was clean and comfy.,positive
"Super location, cool bar, clean rooms, simple, but totally sufficient breakfast, safe area",positive
"Lovely house in a lovely residential area. Well furnished and well equipped. Lots of space inside and a large patio with a jacuzzi. Garage with a sauna and bicycles if needed. Nice to have a kitchen with an induction hob, dishwasher and a huge freezer too. All those little things you wonder if you need to bring were there, decent sized toiletries, soap, washing-up liquid, dishwasher tabs, loads of towels, salt, kitchen towel, kitchen roll... Internet connection worked fine for streaming and there is a strong wifi signal throughout the property. Owners easily reachable on whatsapp and they live next door. They're experienced hosts with more than one property so clearly know what they're doing. Would definitely look to stay here again next time we're in the region.",positive
"Everything was excellent, so warm and welcoming, we would definitely return if we was back in the area, thank you for such a pleasant stay.",positive
"Not much around the hostel to see or do. The shower was push button which I didn't like.,

I thoroughly enjoyed everything of the Minsk hotel and will be back to stay. I like the late night 24hr bar as I think its great for hotel patrons. Dont lose that.",positive
"Everything was perfect considering the price.,

Very nice and cozy place. Great bed. Silence. Breakfast was also fine. The owner is a wonderful woman. Her advices about restaurants and cafes made our stay in Bruges amazing. Very reasonable price.",positive
"Superb character, excellent location and charming staff",positive
"The bathroom would benefit from a fan to reduce the condensation.,

The Apartment looks very new, everything is in excellent condition and very clean. There is a lot of space, we were travelling with two teenagers and it was very appropriate for a family of four adults. The WiFi was excellent. The kitchen looks as though it has never been used, nice touch there is coffee, tea, water and some biscuits provided. The bathroom is spacious, spotlessly clean and good quality, nice touch the owner provides free shampoo and shower wash. The car parking is free, off street and right outside the door. The owner is a really nice guy and very co-operative. This property is very good value for money for a family visiting the area.",positive
"No lift to the room on 3-rd floor, only narrow stairs",positive
"Only suggestion i have is that the same TV set up is in the lounge. Bedrooms have the best TV/Movie selection going.,

Wow what a place. Couldn’t fault it beautifully furnished. Everything you need literally home from home and will be using this as my base every year onwards writing this as we pack up to leave makes me sad.",positive

Very spacious rooms (a separate bathroom and sleeping room)  in a quiet hotel. Very clean and great value for money. The owners are very friendly. Breakfast is served at the room and is very good.,positive
"At first I did not like the Soviet ambience, but then I changed my mind. It is a part of the charm. Luckily the room has been recently renovated but the hallways and the breakfast room are from back in the day. ,

Nice room with a comfortable king size bed and comfy sheets and bedding. The bathroom was not very modern, but it was renovated in the last 10 years I guess, so it was nice enough. Very clean room and bathroom. The room was on the 9th floor with great views from the windows in two directions, including the old part of the city. Breakfast was simple and tasty - convenient and good value.",positive

Nice view from my room",positive
"Nothing. Keep up the good work.,

It was very clean and all necessary facilities were there.",positive
"Breakfast not in the price. Breakfast wasn't tasty may be only eggs were OK.,

As expected - huge Soviet style hotel with old fashion decoration both inside and outside. It uses mostly by goverment business travellers. We stayed here because of hopelessness  - other hotels in Vitebsk +- the same.",negative
"friendly, nice room, ease of private parking",positive

- It was close to the city center
- nice rooms
- the bar is very good priced
- staff were lovely :)",positive
"We came when the weather was terribly hot in Balen, and there was air-conditioning only in hallway, so bedrooms, kitchen, living room were way too hot. But most of the year weather is normal and then there is no need for airco:),

Very nice hosts! Perfect Villa beautifully decorated, full privacy, big spacious Villa, very well equipped, big garden, 2 bikes available for us free of charge, big nice jaccuzi, BBQ,...Area very suitable for kids, allot of indoor playgrounds and activities for kids just few minutes by car from Villa.",positive
"The breakfast option could be improved. Only toast, cereal and a couple of fruits are your options.,

Although it was further than I thought it would be, it was just still a manageable 7-10 minute walk to Brussels Central train station. The size of the room and ensuite bathroom in the double room just surprised us as we thought it would be smaller.",positive
"Great central location, comfortable room and a great choice at breakfast, lots of other facilities available. We were given two new bottles of water each day. The tour desk lady was very friendly and helpful, and organised some great day trips for us; both with guides who spoke excellent English. Restaurants and shopping are available very close by. Perfect for seeing what Minsk has to offer.",positive
Excellent breakfast.,positive
"no free internet in the room. It was very surprising. Free internet was only in the lobby. Otherwise, It was necessary to pay for it separately and only with BLR phone number,

Nice and well-furnished room. Location: the city centre, close to all the main historical and cultural places. The view from the window was on the river - very beautiful.",positive
"N/A,

Very accommodating and friendly",positive

"A person (staff) enter in our room in the morning with out permission and we were naked. He nocked I said Yes and he just opened the door.,

The breakfast was ok, the essencial was there for a nice morning meal! the room was not like the pictures, so not what we expected, but still an ok room for an hostel. We checked in late at nigt and that wasn´t a problem. The hostel is just 20 min walking to the center and 7min by e-bike. If you want a sheep place and you doesn´t matter for the style of the room, tis is the place!",negative

Spacious room. Clean accommodation. There were attempts to make breakfast interesting. Staff was friendly and helpful.",positive
"Overall very pleased.,

Location and comfort",positive
"Wifi is not quite good. There were so many doors but no signal of the reception desk.,

First of all the apartment was better than it showed in the pictures (this is something that the owner has to change) and it has two bedrooms although in booking.com was obvious that it will be only one room with two single beds (and we assumed that there would be a folding couch). Instead of this there were 4 single beds. The hotel is located on the boarders between Belgium and Nederland in a very quiet location with small farms around it. It was clean and neat. In a very small distance (1.4km) there are bars and restaurants where you can eat delicious Belgian specialties.",positive
Nice and clean place without any special atmosphere. Good position and view from the hotel as well. Good enough for one or two days.,negative
"The shower unfortunately leaked, leaving a pond of water on the bathroom floor.,

Comfortable, spacious apartment. Great breakfast. Ample amenities.",positive
"Blankets and sheets instead of a duvet - not ideal at the beginning of January but not a huge issue and wouldn't deter us staying here again,

Hostess gave us a map and explained where the main attractions were and how to get there from the hotel. She also recommended places to eat, and on our final day helped us with getting to the train station - by telling us the buses were free that particular day! Incredibly helpful",positive
Beautiful interior decoration and very spacious room.,positive
"Uncomfortable bed
,

The location and the breakfast",positive

Nice comfort room.

Me and my girlfriend recommend this hotel for everyone who plan to visit Vitebsk.",positive
The bed and pillows extra comfy!,positive
"You can hear voices from rooms near by and above. The only weak point I think.,

Booked NY night and day after. As soon as we entered this boutique hotel we were surrounded with warmth and cosines. Lady owner was so kind. Ask for room at upper floor facing garden and magnificent view of old buildings. It is also so clam there in relation to traffic. Bathroom went for renovation recently. Build with proper quality. Also nice dining area.",positive

"Breakfast the same every day ,

Location ,clean,staff",positive
"Some noise from people returning to their room for more drinks at 3am or so, but otherwise fine! ,

Hotel was clean, comfortable and refurbished - with a slight retro-Soviet look to it still. Centrally-located and close to all the tourist spots as well as a good 10-15 minute walk to the train station. A large supermarket is located in the next building. Staff at reception were a little cool, but check-in and check-out were simple and quick. Make sure sure to spend a full day or two in Vitebsk!",positive
"Small, comfortable friendly",positive
Fantastic - a real gem!,positive
"Maybe have a little more drawer space in the rooms. ,

Beautiful rooms, wonderful staff and beautiful setting for breakfast. Location was superb. Attention to detail was great. Great background music in the lounge, bar and breakfast room!
You can tell that you are staying in a very special hotel and one that many will never experience.",positive
"There is no towels (except one near the shower) and shampoo for free, but you can find soap in the bathroom. We used battery for warm, but it was switched off in the night.,

Its good and clean hostel in the central part of city. Room was comfortable for staying per night.Good breakfast (enough verity of products), polite staff. If you want, you can use kitchen with clean caps and plates. I can recommend this hostel for booking.",positive
"Good location, close to the train station and metro line as well as within walking distance to the city center.Nice and helpful staff, good spacious room and bathroom and large locker as well as free luggage store. Large common areas inside and outside in a courtyard.Good breakfast.",positive

Perfect breakfast, herbal tea is supet, even minestrone",positive
"You can feel in many details the touch of the Soviet epoch: bathroom equipment, common spaces. Thought rarely it can be nostalgic.,

Very good value for money. Great location, rooms are normal with all necessary things. Breakfast was ok for 2 days, may be the third time it would be boring. Coffee was quite good for breakfast.",positive
"nothing.,

Such a quiet little island of comfort, excellent quality products, big room, lovely rooftop terrace. Will definitely be back.",positive

The staff was very friendly and helpful. The structure is really nice, clean and comfortable",positive

"The door to the balcony was broken and made me feel not safety because the room is on the first floor.,

The room is not so small. The facilities are good",positive
"The location of this hostel is very good, close to the city center, close to train stations, etc.The (double) room we received was very large, and so was the bathroom. At checkin we received free linens which took only a few minutes to ""install"". Towels are not free (the rent price was low, though).Breakfast wasn't very varied, but it was ok. The most pleasant surprise was at checkout, which we had specified to be very early in the morning. The evening before they offered us breakfast to-go (each got a paper bag with mostly the same items that you get at regular breakfast). We appreciated this very much.",positive
"Nothing,

The hotel is very clean and the staffs are helpful.",positive

"My only  caution would be if you stay on the top floor the steps are very step so if you have walking problems could be an issue. Also no bath but that is a minor grip.,

The lady that ran the hotel was so welcoming and very helpful. Knows everything about Bruges and really helped make our visit special. Hotel is in a great location just outside of the main market about a 10 minute walk. Listed as a 2 star hotel the value you pay exceeds expectations.",positive
"I liked everything about the property ,

A unique and beautiful renovated Hotel, family owned and run.  Beautiful bedrooms, on entry level  for all staying is a beautifully presented bar and separate sitting room where to relax in peace. The 15th Century breakfast room and the breakfast is a must to experience.
Honestly this Hotel is definitely worth looking into, if in Bruges again I will definitely stay there.",positive

Card for entry fails frequently. Just stops working. ,

Great and big  bathroom in the room.
Full wall mirror, perfect for nude selfies in the bathroom.",positive

"Nothing ,

Beautiful decor
Great location
Very helpful and courteous staff",positive
Good location and very clean.,positive
"No access to kitchen and fridge (although the staffers say they can store your food in the fridge in their reception office, I don't think that will work well and conveniently as a normal fridge for guests in a typical hostel does).,

Very clean and well maintained. The whole hostel is big, with a courtyard and common area. The rooms are not that spacious, but not too small either.",positive
"Too expensive breakfast ,

Perfect location in the heart of Minsk",positive

Good breakfast and location.",positive
"Bed was too soft and very noisy.,

Fitness centre, free parking, good location, very quite room",positive
"The room's door was hard to open and close which was a big annoyance. Luckily, the staff helped with that issue. The breakfast wasn't all that good but at least it wasn't too expensive. That being said, the downsides weren't too severe.,

The room was very nice and clean (in fact, it exceeded my expectations by a large amount) and the staff was very helpful. Also, the location was great. Overall, I was positively surprised considering the relatively mixed reviews and I can recommend staying here.",positive
"Nothing,

Best Spa Ever",positive
"Very cosy and clean, lovely host and breakfast good value for money",positive
"We thought the price for breakfast was very expensive so didn't pay for that - but it is optional, and I'm sure it would have been great! Nothing to complain about at all.,

The hotel is absolutely beautiful - very tastefully decorated and extremely comfortable (great bed!). The staff are polite and helpful. The location is perfect - 5 minute walk to the Belfort, and everything else is walkable, as Bruges isn't a huge city.",positive

Good hostel for the price. The room is nice and have bathroom inside. Good breakfast included. The location is great - close to the metro station and other attractions; just 10 min walk from Noord Station.",positive

"The towel heater in the bathroom was too hot. Could be a serious problem with children touching it. Will recommend it to everybody.,

Beautiful hotel. Great service. Unique and charming.",positive
"In hostels, a lot depends on the behaviour of the other guests, and unfortunately the staff has little power on that (drunk guest entering the room at 2AM shouting, preparing his bed with full lights on, and eventually falling down from bunk bed).,

Confortable beds and rooms. Nice bar. Great variety of food at breakfast.",negative
"From the breakfast I was able to eat only a boiled egg (no salt available) with basic toast and drink some coffee of a low quality. No ham, fried eggs etc. Have not seen any green tea either...Beds were kinda small even for a small person and very soft. It was a bit too warm in the room.,

Staff and location. Superclean facilities, rooms ok.",positive
"No Vegan food ,

The location",positive
"""Free internet"" wasn't working well. There is an option to get a very good connection through Byfly, 2.5 BYN for a day or 5BYN for 5 days. A bit sneaky. ,

The hotel is very clean; comfy bed; pleasant prices at the restaurant for complex menus.",positive

"On Fri evening restaurants were closed for a function. Food served in lobby bar ! Could have been better organised. Bad practice closing both restaurants to guests,

The hotel was of a high standard. Food very good",positive

Excellent locationHumble but comfortable rooms",positive

very helpful staff; great location; cosy & comfortable; excellent room with all the features we could want,positive
"It wasn't clean. The trashbin in our room wasn't even empty
Check in was not really flexible. We waited almost an hour. And then there was a queue 
But it's not expensive 
Ouh and the beds aren't comfortable and there is no elevator but how I already said for the price it's okay ,

They have soymilk and vegan options(margarine, marmalade, fruits) for breakfast. Breakfast is included and pretty okay for a hostel 
Check out is easy",positive
"We took 3 rooms for a work trip.  One of the rooms was fine, but the other two on floor 3 were effectively greenhouses / conservatories. The fully glazed elevation had two tiny openable windows. With the heatwave it was impossible to sleep in there. We managed to move one room, but two of our team had a very poor nights sleep. These rooms should be discounted, or not used in the heat as they are not habitable.,

The building itself is nice with a pleasant courtyard. The staff were friendly. Cold water served at reception which was a nice touch. It is in a good area, and easy to reach from the Eurostar. Breakfast was fine.",positive
"No problems at all. All good.,

Excellent basic hotel and very good value for money. We had everything we needed and enjoyed the old 'Soviet atmosphere'. Beds are comfortable, bathroom is good enough with good shower and plenty of hot water. No frills or luxuries, but at this price we  have no complaints :-)Well located for enjoying Vitebsk. We enjoyed our stay and would return.",positive
"almost everything was enjoyable. but the wifi connection is up for improvement ,

Practical location, beautiful room, sauna and steamroom, friedly staff, good matrass, quietness",positive
"In the departure morning we spoked with the host to prepare 2 sandwiches, given the fact that we would leave at 4AM and we would not be there for the breakfast. She confirmed the sandwiches but to our surprise when leaving there was nothinf for us.
Secondly the rooms are not sound proofed. You can here if someone is on the hallway or in the other rooms or if a door is slamed. You are also hearing all the noise that the cars are doing in the street. ,

The room was nice but a bit cold. The windows were not closing entirely and that was the reason. 
It is at 15 min walk to the city centre. 
The owner was nice to book a taxi for us in the departure morning

We loved that it was family owned and operated.  So lovely.  Exceptional attention to detail.,positive
"Bathroom and it's cleanliness, the basin faucet needs descaling, same for the shower faucet. Ceiling requires attention, there are dark places all over, looks like some kind of that unhealthy fungus is growing there.,

Helpfull staff, great location just 15 min from the city center, bar downstairs. Breakfast didn't give a lot of choices, but i've enjoyed it",positive
"Very few toilets outside the rooms.,

I liked the hostel very much. I especially liked the staff and their service and the location. I highly recommend the place.",positive
"It's a ""back to USSR"" experience. The atmosphere and the design will take you back to 80-s, although there is some improvement in the service. Some points :1. Real KEY to open your room(do you have some extra place in your pockets:))?2.  We had two bathrooms and two bathtubs in them. Both were leaking and didn't work appropriately. 3. We took a breakfast included and had to give the waitress these special breakfast ""tickets"" each time.4. We were provided Wifi passwords for every device we had. PC in the room(Windows XP!) needed one of those password too. They were valid for 2 days and then we had to ask for another...5.  We had some tiny shampoo sachet - one for a person in the room(it was an ""improved apartment""). I would recommend taking your own shampoo visiting this hotel.,

Great location - right in the center of Vitebsk, close to everything. A shopping center is within 2 minutes of walk. Decent restaurant.",positive
"Just a short walk from the Eurostar train station.   Despite arriving after midnight, I managed to get a good night's sleep before an early start the following day.",positive
Fleur was a great host at the B & B. If i'm back in the area i'd plan to stay here again. Nice to be outside of the square and experience more of the actual city.,positive
"Nothing.,

This place is full of details with local decorations and people here are so welcoming and easy communicating.  Breakfast is tasty and the interior design is fascinating.",positive
"Electricity kept tripping in the room meaning had to charge phones in the morning and wasting a lot of time hanging around. Also in the self catered kitchen facilities were poor and limited. I’m sad to leave bad feedback because the room it’s self was stunning,

The room itself was outstanding. Really stunning. Two floors with a private bathroom and sitting area.",positive
"The room was rather small but find for a couple nights. Bed is lumpy- time for new mattresses! ,

Walking distance to train station and to sightseeing in town. Good price.",positive
"The bad was not so clean and the water didn't drain properly.,

Nice design of the rooms and quiet.The breakfast was great.",positive
"Parking might be problem. But the owner of the hotel allowed us to park to her private parking,of course to be paid. We stayed in a family room,upstairs.  No lift,stairs are a little bit steep to carry heavy luggage . You must be carefull to inform the owner in case of late arrival (after 18:00 pm),

Very good breakfast. Dont miss the home made jams. Owner of the hotel is very kind lady. She gave very good information related with the good restaurants,attractions..etc. Very clean. location is perfect to access  to the Brugge center in couple of minutes by walking.  Old style,good protected Brugge house.",positive

It was comfortable and clean ..... walking distance from the Center - about 20 min ... overall good property",positive

Nice room and great location in the city centre. The view from my room on the 6th floor was also pretty nice.",positive
"Clean, close to the center, friendly and helpful staff - everything was great. Very recommendable place to stay",positive
"Our TV didn’t work, and the bathroom door was a closet door (you could hear everything) that fell off the track every time you open/closed it. No big deal as we weren’t there to watch TV, but on our last night we found someone else’s blood on our mattress (underneath the fitted sheet) and a sock that didn’t belong to me or my significant other on the floor. ,

Breakfast was great, location to the main market is just a 10-15 minute walk. It’s close to bus stations to get you to and from the train station. Fleur was very pleasant, easy to talk to and helpful. Close to restaurants and the honour bar was a pretty cool touch!",positive
"Shower a little uncomfortable to use.,

Beautiful little hotel, great breakfast, staff very attentive.",positive
Wifi not good,positive
"Very nostalgic feeling in this hotel. But location very good, close to the sights. Breakfast packages were a bit incomprehensible, but in themselves were good",positive
"Wonderful staff 
Very helpful
Special thank to Sabri who was excellent in all means",positive
"We spent a night in the hotel. It looks and feels like a B&B operating in a once stylish middle class town house (built in the early XX century). The backyard / garden facing rooms can be a better pick as our room was front facing and quite noisy early on. Lots of trucks were passing by.   The shower + toilette was not properly separated (with little or no ventilation of the bathroom) from the large room (once elegant street facing living room). The drawback of the conversion was there were limited or non-existent common spaces of the hotel. Expect to pay 10 EUR for the parking cash on the arrival.,

It is an OK stay considering it is Bruges and the price. The internet was above expectation: it was super fast and simple to use. The staff was helpful, they spoke English and French (besides the Flamish of course). The overall impression it is  an affordable stay.",positive
Great location and beautiful interior,positive
"There is no soap in the bathroom and no toilette in the room's bathroom so only two toilettes shared by the whole floor.

Location / friendly staff / private parking 10€ per day",negative
"The room was too small for 4 people,

Good staff, good facilities, very good breakfast. It worth the price.",positive
"The breakfast offer could be a bit improved. The hotel is a bit dated, but it did not affect at all the comfort of my stay. ,

The location is unbeatable. The staff was very friendly.",positive
"Interior design quite trendy and classy but a bit dark.,

Big, comfortable rooms with all facilities and attentionate service.",positive
"Our room was in the third floor which may not be proper for elderly people. Room was very small. Water pressure of the bathroom was very low and hot&cold water setting was unstable.  We stayed for two days. Our room was not cleaned during our stay.,

Breakfast was good.",negative
"Room 923. It was too hot in room. Portable air conditioner didn't help much,

Amazing location. Good view. Balcony in 923 room",positive
"A very stylish hotel at every detail! The black and white interior, the stylish and very personal photograph posters and the effect colours give a very classy feeling. The personnel was very friendly and helpful. Good breakfast. Nice roof terrace.",positive
"Receptionist could have been more attentive ,

The breakfast was fabulous, many organic products, mostly local Belgian specialities. For me definitively a reason to stay again at this hotel!
The room was very quiet. The hotel is in walking distance to the gare du Midi, if you come on a Sunday don’t miss the really large and varied Sunday market. Parking at Porte de Hal is 3€/day at weekends (20 mins walk, but an unbeatable price)
And yes, although it became a little touristy, visit the very nearby Chantillon brewery. The beers are superb.",positive
"A really cute apartment on the beach front, but out of the centre of Ostend and all its crowds. The apartment is stylish and comfortable, and the kitchen equipment  & tableware are great - the selection of glasses is maybe better than ours at home! We managed to use 1 or 2 of each type, without breaking anything! Our concierge Bavo was always available, and helped us in a friendly manner, including some recommendations of the better local fish traiteurs.The best test of hosts is actually when something goes wrong! In our case, the thermostat in the shower stuck - on MAX!! Impossible  to use it! Then the host/concierge team showed their reactiveness, and hands on attitude, giving us a workable shower on a Sunday evening. I very much appreciate this attitude, so thanks Bavo (and your wife) for your Sunday evening plumbing skills!Local supermarkets nearby, free parking, in 100 steps you are on the sand already. The little terrace faces East, it overlooks the runway of the airport, it is sheltered from sea breezes (or gale-force winds) and has lots of sun. 100 steps or so to the nearest tram stop!",positive
"Everything.,

The apartment was very clean with an open lounge , perfect for family with children. There is everything you need in the kitchen. Nice view from the balcony window. Plenty of storage space. Carffoure supermarket only few min drive from the property. Plenty of parking space. There are 3 lifts to the property which is on the 8th floor. We went in winter so the balcony window was shut all the time, if you are staying in summer with children, be mindful of this as you don't want to play around in the balcony. Otherwise the property is safe with 2 secure entries. Restaurants is a bit further nearer towards Ostend . We visited Bruge twice during the Christmas festive and it's only 25/30 minutes drive away. The host was very helpful and gave us a bottle of champagne upon arrival.",positive
"Nothing,

The apartment is beautiful, and the view from the 8th floor is stunning. The beds are very comfortable, and everything that you need is in the kitchen. The bathroom towels are soft and the shower is super nice. The apartment is just across the road from the beach (which has a nice bar/restaurant right there along with a children's playground). There is a parking lot right in front of the apartment. I can't say enough good things about our stay.",positive

"The old cigarette smoke smell, just needed a little refresher.,

We were very happy with location, facilities and pricing. The only thing the room did smell of old cigarette smoke that was not a deal breaker but was there. All other aspects were very positive.",positive
"Accessing the hostel from the shuttle bus stop can be difficult - 20 mins walk through a very rough area, can be dangerous at night. 
The toilets never had toilet paper in them, we had to constantly go down to the receptionist and complain about it.
The breakfast is very basic, and the dining area tends to get over crowded so I’d recommend going early for breakfast. ,

4 bed dorm size is good
Free printing of boarding passes",negative

Beautiful in every way, with every conceivable amenity provided. Rooms are utterly charming and comfortable. Staff is helpful, and professional. Perfect location. LOVED the double sinks in the bathroom!",positive
"The property was really well thought out, beds were a bit uncomfortable though.,

Quirky property, kids absolutely loved that it was something a bit different and it was well kitted out for them and me. The owners were really helpful with things to do in and and around Dinant, and we had a really busy 5 days.",positive

Good selection at breakfast with attentive staff. Great location. Very clean and comfortable.",positive

Perfect, beautifully served breakfast.
Lovely garden with a sitting area.
Close to the historic centrum and Hoge Kempen park.",positive

The owner was so friendly and welcoming, room in general is so nice and clean, the bed was super comfy ,and the location was quiet with a good view and it wasn't far away from the bus station. I recommend.❤",positive
"The apartment is very quiet and everything echos. You can hear everything the upstairs people are doing. There was nothing out of the ordinary about the noise, people walking around but it startled me a few times 😳😂,

The location was an easy 10-15m walk to major sightseeing attractions. Great spot and fit for our family of 5!",positive

"The fridge was broken and we were told to go down to the bar to ask for milk /drinks. We had the bridal suite and therefore wanted some time together alone in our room. However that wasn't the case. Had to wake up and get changed to walk down and ask for milk the same at night....they knew the fridge was broken before we arrived too!,

Staff were fantastic. Knowledgeable and proffessional. Chatted to the gentlemen (forgot his name sorry) and met Jack, his dog. Lovely man :)",positive

Functional business hotel without great aspirations. Given the price it was perfectly fine.",positive
"The bathroom was supposed to be private but it was outside shared one. And we couldn’t have breakfast because we were standing outside the door & the key didn’t work. By that time it was 9.30. Reception staff asked another kitchen person to get some sandwich for us but when we went back to the breakfast area, another person in the kitchen said he can’t make & he did not. So we had to leave hostel without breakfast which I didn’t like. Even they could’ve asked to help ourselves & have bread with jam or something. But they were not helpful.,

Reception & bar staffs were very friendly & helpful.",positive
"This place is really what it says it is. You book you pay, you enjoy. It’s as simple as that! 
Good food, fantastic staff, extremely helpful and kind. The location is actually really good, it’s not in the busy centre which I actually liked about it. But having said that, it isn’t far from the main high street, walking distance I would say. 
Due to pandemic of COVID 19 there were very few people in the hotel, which I kinda liked too :) 
All and all great experience! 
Enjoy ;)",positive

"Can’t think of anything negative.,

Everything - room size, location, atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.",positive
"Many floors with steep uneven stairs is not suitable for everyone. Being asked for large cash deposit and paying extra for towels and sheets (to be fitted and removed yourself) was a bit cheeky. ,

Great location handy for centre of liege. Beautiful old house split over many floors. Lots of room for a group of friends.",positive
"The hotel doesn't have an air conditioning on the room, it's very manageable.
The coffee is alright, but might be bitter for some. ,

The personnel is very friendly. They really help you. 
The WiFi experience is good.
The breakfast was well prepared.
You do get a lounge in the shade of your terrace.",positive

It was a nice stay. Staff helpful. Beds comfy. Showers good. Clean and effective",positive

Location was perfect. Close to centre but in a charming and fairly quiet district. Apartment was clean and spacious. Hosts were very friendly and accommodating.",positive
"Good hotel, rooms were quite comfortable and there was a work desk. There's a restaurant and a small bar. There's a s good gym and a small supermarket across the road. ,

The bed linen was rather coarse. The breakfast was not very good and not worth $10. No restaurants or cafes near the hotel",positive
"Smoking area prior to reception. For people who dont smoke, this is quite off as you need to pass thru it,

The staff was very accommodating. They sorted our problem with storage and allowed us to have our breakfast due for next day as we had to leave really early. Everyone was beaming with smile and the place has an upbeat vibe.",positive
The shrimps in the restaurant were with guts.,positive
"-,

Beautifully kept, elegant and I love the touches like chandeliers, bar and decorations. Staff were great - suggested a local restaurant for dinner which was delicious and they made check out very easy. Despite being right  in the centre, it is in a quiet spot. Unlike many old places, they have a small lift if required. Breakfasts are well catered buffet with wide variety to choose from. Exceptionally clean. Would be very happy to return anytime.",positive
"Everything would have been fine if the check-in agent/staff had been more informative. The hotel had beverages in the check-in area, so after traveling for over 2 1/2 hours, a couple of us took water and crémant. We didn't ask, but as there were glasses in a bowl, we thought it was for the guests. While waiting for everyone to comedown, one of my friends took another glass of crémant. The check-in lady got really mean and angry with her saying, ""it was a welcome drink and that she'd already had a drink."" There wasn't a sign posted ANYWHERE to indicate that and further more, she never mentioned or offered it to us at check in. We asked if we could have the wifi code and in her rude manner, she pointed out that it was on the card key. After shopping we returned to the hotel and one of my friends happened to read the back of the card key holder and saw that we could get a 10% discount on shopping at the Maasmechelen Village. The check-in agent knew that we were going shopping, but fail to tell us about this great deal. I will say that the check-in agent at check out was much nicer and seemed sympathetic to our problems with her colleague and would mention it to her.,

The location and room!",positive
"Nothing,

Quite room, comfortable beds, location, nice restaurant, gim was ok",positive
"Very quiet room, quiet hotel in general. Perfect for us traveling with a 2-month-old baby and a 2 and a half old boy.Fabienne was always available and friendly. The village is cute, clean and nice to stroll around. Many restaurant options. We recommend Het oude gerechtshof in the village, and Pizzeria Al Mulino just 1,5km from the hotel through the countryside.",positive
"Only got one towel to dry my hands with and shower for a 2 night stay, disappointing.,

Nice little place, about 10 minutes away from the centre..
Top floor room was clean and quiet.
No tv or aircon but you don’t come to Bruges to watch tv and the fan works fine.
The bar downstairs was open all day and the staff were great.
Free WiFi didn’t extend up to the room.",positive
"Only One toilet,

Great location and big enough for 6 of us!",positive
"Super noisy from the street. We travelled with older person and she struggled to enter the shower as she needed to make a big step up to enter.,

Friendly staff",positive
"The room should be equiped with hairdryer and towels. In addition, even though I was informed about the luggage’s locker and has prepared mine, but none of my locks can fit with the luggage’s lock hole 😂,

The room was clean, cozy and convenient, and the view from the window was nice. The staffs were helpful and friendly. The location is good, only 30 minutes walking from some main tourist attractions such as Eglise Notre Dame Brussels or Grand Place. The breakfast included was nice as well. Comparing the amount of money I have spent with the service I received, I highly recommend this hostel.",positive
"Reception stuff could behave better - more polite. Why not smile never? Could be better and more fresh food in chineese restaurant.,

Still best choice in Minsk.",positive
"The Lift, it took one minute to get to the second floor - we found it quite funny actually.,

Location - not to close to centre; quiet, even though next to a Cathedral!Staff were outstanding; very friendly and always willing to help.Breakfast was amazing and well worth the extra cost.Room (suite) was roomy and comfortable; bathroom was modern with an excellent shower.",positive
"Parking fee to expensive. ,

Nice building",positive
"You can feel and see the Soviet style in everything, the beds in the twin room are really just for one person, the photos don't show the real size.,

2 best things about this hotel is 1) the location - right in the center of Minsk and 2) the secured private parking (we could leave our car free of charge after check-out and stroll around the Minsk). The breakfast is splendid: omelet, eggs, selection of cheeses and sausages, salmon, veggies, pancakes, pastry, juices and coffee.",positive
Breakfast was very good.,positive
"Frendly people in reception, helpful. ,

Pub next to reception",positive
"The location is perfect, very safe and very close to the city centre. Supermarkets are really close. And the host is very helpful. When we asked for a little help, the host was there in half an hour. The apartment was really clean. We did not use but there are also a washingmachine and a dryer. And a dishwasher. Wifi was very good. There is a lift. We enjoyed our stay.",positive
"The rooms didn't have any air conditioning or ventilation system. I had to open the window and the door at the same time to freshen the air in the room.The nearby road is quite loud.The fridge didn't work.,

Good location, a short walk from a subway station.Decent interior condition.Polite staff.Great value-for-money.",positive
Must eat their breakfast. Worth for money.,positive
everything at the highest level,positive
"Nothing,

As we were there for our wedding anniversary we paid a little bit more, it was totally worth it.  Every thing was clean and fresh and the staff were fantastic.  Would go again.",positive
"Find a better closing system for the shower. When I took a 5 minute shower, half of the bathroom was flooded. ,

It gives you the feeling of a state mansion. The history connected to the mining site and its buildings are very well conserved. The rooms are clean and comfortable.",positive
"The hotel could improve certain features related to accessibility of its facilities for guests with reduced mobility (some steps, excessively thick carpets, high counters). Otherwise everything was great!,

The hotel exceeded my expectations! It's conveniently located in the heart of Minsk with easy access everywhere. The single room I ordered was bigger and more comfortable I'd expected, and the breakfast was superb. The hotel has a very decent restaurant where I happily ended up having my dinner both nights of my stay.",positive
"The Boomgaard is located in a quieter historical zone but with access to some exceptional Italian and Belgian restaurants about 7 min walk and recommended by the owner. Our room was spacious, impeccably clean with a large walk-in shower. The breakfast was plentiful with much attention to detail. A self-timer egg machine allows you to cook your eggs to your preference.  Of course, there is still scrambled with 2 kinds of bacon on offer with a good selection of bread.  I appreciated that she also offered warned milk next to the commercial Nespresso machine which provides better coffee than the automatic preset machines that you see at most buffets. The owner, Fabiana, even took the time to light our candle during our breakfast. It is a smaller hotel so it delivered the kind of personal service we had hoped for. It may be only 3 stars, but it delivered 5 star value.",positive
Bar was amazing. The breakfast was good too. The room was a bit hot due to the summer but that is considerable.,positive
"There as nothing that we did not like.,

The location was excellent. 2 blocks from St. Catherine's square, but in a quiet section of town, even though so close to the tourist area. Very easy to walk to Gran Place. When we arrived (early), the very friendly cleaning person met us and let us leave our bags. The apartment was modern, immaculately clean, and extremely spacious. Everything was perfect! I would highly recommend this property to families or groups of from 4-6 people. You won't be dissapointed.",positive
Little bit costly. BYN 20 per person is not worth what is available there.,positive
"Twin bed could have had a better mattress with more pillows but none the less was what was expected for the price.,

I liked the free breakfast included in the already well priced hostel, even though it was basic it made the trip easier for a budgeting traveling couple",positive
"The place. In summer it would be definitely nice to stay by the side of the river, but overall you either use your car or take a taxi to get anywhere. However, Oktyabrskaja with all its bars and super brunch places is a 10min walk.,

The best part is SPA zone with a big swimming pool. Nice rooms, quite clean with super comfy beds. Definitely lack a more quality cosmetics in the bathroom (the one there is quite basic, something you can find in 3* hotels), no cosmetic pads...Small things like shoe polisher or coffee maker are lacking too, tea bags are not added each day. The hotel is a nice promise, a little bit of attention to creating a superior customer experience through details could add value.",positive

Beautiful attention to detail at every turn. Gorgeous hotel. Service incredible.",positive
The location and comfort.,positive
Location of the hotel and hair conditioner :),positive
The friendlyness,positive

Good and clean appartment in a nice neighbourhood with many nice restaurants. Recommended for 4 persons but not for 6.",positive

Excellent breakfast and stable Wi-Fi.",positive

Wonderful staff, absolutely beautiful room and excellent location.",positive
"Restaurant is poor to be honest ! Foods are not amazing 🙃,

I stayed with my daughter and really nice hotel! We enjoyed a lot",positive
"Breakfast in my opinion is rather expensive... therefore I booked without.,

Check-In and registration paper was done quickly and the receptionist was very friendly! I had a nice room with a good view to the big square!",positive
"Very minor observation - lack of door to shower room which housed the toilet could be an issue for some people who like their privacy!,

One of the best small hotels I have ever stayed at. Great hosting, clean, spacious room, good breakfast, quiet setting, adequate parking and only 15 minute drive into Maastricht town centre. Also some good restaurants within easy walking distance. Will certainly return.",positive
"to many noise (there is no sound isolation and you here people from other rooms),

Nice! Wonderful location
Guys from reception are very friendly!",positive
"A bit of street noise but that is to be expected in a busy city (they were having a jazz festival when we stayed). Mostly blocked out when windows closed.Blind in double room not great at keeping light out.,

Great location, wonderful having a lift to get large suitcases up to the apartment. Accomodation suited us really well.",positive
"Strange smell in the room. But it vanishes once you open a window.,

Clean, quiet, very good and healthy breakfast. Parking lot, small fridge, TV.",positive
"Found someone else’s rights in the room. The beds were quite hard and the toilet was slightly blocked from whoever had used the room before. If you want to use a towel it will be an extra 3 euros so make sure you take your own.,

Hostel has a great little bar with lots of great local beers at a reasonable price. They offer a free walking tour which is a great way to see the study and the staff were great.",positive
Secret police and agents everywhere. Assume they record everything in rooms allocated to foreigners. Other than that perfect. Caveat- the hotel is an island of luxury and excess in the ocean of poverty and oppression. This sucks as much as anything can suck.,positive
"nothing,

everything was perfect.",positive
"Ideal central location to explore Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. I would recommend the Maasmechelen Village for shopping and dining. Its in walking distance of the hotel.",positive
"Room tended to get too warm,

Spacious suite, proximity to theatre. Great tub and hot water and omelet maker part of lavish breakfast",positive
"Nothing ,

Upgraded to a large, beautiful room with sliding glass doors out on to a patio area and garden.  Lovely bathroom with a great shower. Fantastic breakfast with plenty of choice. Would definitely stay again.",positive
The bathroom is too small.,positive
the Lift did work all the time of my stay,positive
"Actually I think I was in one of the oldest rooms of the hostel. The room could have been a bit more clean. There were some hairs from a previous visitor left in the closet. And the one with the blanket is still like this (only a sheet and a normal inlet). If you know it, you can arrange and I think that the reason is because of the heat during the summer. So please understand this as a neutral point! The location might be in the centrum but it’s still everytime a quick fifteen minute walk so maybe it’s better for a solo traveller to stay closer inside.,

The breakfast for a youth hostel was really good. Fresh fruits, three sorts of jam, ham and cheese. The staff was super kind and nice they also have their honest opinion on tours for example which I think is always gold worth!",positive
"The rooms are nicely done and very comfortable to stay in. The sleep quality was excellent. I did not try the food but the restaurant looked quite nice and if I had to guess, I would say the food would match. Everything about the hotel was",positive
"Hard to find fault here. I guess breakfast seemed high priced and there are fantastic waffles everywhere so we skipped the hotel breakfast and wandered.,

This was one of our best hotel experiences ever.  Fantastic location, cute as heck, tremendously helpful staff.  Decor was luxurious while remaining pretty kid safe.  They adored it, we adored it.",positive
"Noise in the room explained by staff due to kitchen installations under window. Having to pay for parking? Not possible to dine in hotel fully booked. View from room at back hotel.,

Friendly staff, Proseco at check in , clean room well equipped.",negative

Wonderful location!",positive
"Quite a walk 15 minutes to the bus stop and a long journey from Maastricht by bus 50 minutes and only one an hour. ,

Clean and friendly",positive
"The soap was missing at the bathroom.,

The room and the fact that you can have multiple activities there due to the bar.",negative
"Good place, quite atmosphere, it's the best.",positive

The room they provided us was reasonably spacious especially the bathroom was good considering my wife was on a wheelchair.",positive
"Chinese restaurant in the hotel and breakfast. Both - below my expectations and only because of food. Meals quality is average (If you've ever been in China - not comparable), low value for money you have to pay.  Small parking for guests.,

The room is very comfortable (very similar for 5* hotels in China). Staff - very helpful, I've got very quick responses from them for all my questions.Location - that is only 5* hotel in that district (not far from main industrial area), very pleasant, n",positive

"Since we were in duplex appartment with other people, there was noise from other rooms while they were simply moving. :D Yeah, that sounds funny, but i think  walls/floor were very thin or something..,

The staff was super helpful and always ready to communicate properly. I liked location, only 12-15 minutes and we were in front of Belfry. I also want to mention bar in the reception, that is also nice place to spend time, besides, it is worth pay extra 5 euro for the breakfast. P.S. The music was always good there.",negative

I loved the location of this hotel and the fact it had on site parking despite being right in the middle of town. The staff were more than helpful particularly when our sat nav had us lost. They came to meet us and drive us back in our car! Been to a number of hotels in Brugge but this is the one I’ll be re-booking",positive
"A minor point but I didn’t like how the person on reception spoke about personnel details and final price of my book aloud when other guests were in vicinity.,

"Our room was on the front side of the hotel, where the main street runs past. And underneath our room was the restaurant, where karaoke played until midnight. It would be no problem, if there were air condition, but if you open the window, it's hard to find sleep. Better look for a room on the back side!,

The hotel is about 3km away from the railway-station, good to reach either by walking or (better) by bus. The distance to the bus halt is about 200m, very convenient. The personal is very friendly and try to satisfy all wishes.",positive
"Check in process was done in the bar.,

Very good breakfast. Good location and staff.",positive
"Most of the staff (reception, lobby bar, doorman/bellman, pool staff) were not friendly at all, not smiling. In the morning of August 23, we were passing by the lobby bar and we (!) greeted the waiter who was picking up candles from tables. He responded back without even turning his face to us. 2 bellmen were not smiling, as well as the pool guard. At 21:58 I asked him when the pool is open till tomorrow, he responded: “We close at 10 pm” (I spoke Russian, it’s my mother’s tongue) and looked very serious and sort of impatient. I got an impression he wanted me out of the pool ASAP. There were a few staff members who were friendly, but overall my family and I were shocked by the service... At the time of check in I paid with my credit card and I was not even offered to leave a deposit. I had to come back next day and do it just in case... Your service is not up to the world’s standard. Too bad!,

The room was very comfortable, clean and spacious. Room service was efficient. I really liked your spa facilities.",positive

"Payment- attention to other travelers!!! Conformation received from booking.com you get in USD!!! On arrival when you make check in personal says you must pay in BY Rubles and then the funny thing is that they have their own exchange rate and you end up paying extra when you look on your bank account. No complain if would receive conformation in BY rubles, or explanation in conformation that you will need to pay in BY Rubles, but this small thing disappoint the impression about honesty of hotel.,

Room size- one of the biggest what you will find in Minsk. Good location. Good SPA area.",positive
"Small room,

Small Elegant Hotel",positive
"First of all I received about 10 e-mails from the hotel, before I arrived. I think it was too much for just 2 days of stay.  2nd - room cleaning was a bit funny, there was no cleaning in fact, they just took away all the towels) the rest was left as it was),

I absolutely loved location, design, room and quality of sleep. The air is so sweet there!  Guests are provided with free parking, do not forget to take a coin on reception to leave the parking. I would definitely come again.",positive

Free parking, clean rooms. Actually, we would recommend it with some peculiarities.",positive
"Close to the center, quiet environment.",positive
Absolutely amazing experience. A star on every level. A little gem in Bruges. Would love to have stayed longer and can’t wait to go back. This hotel and staff should be 5 star! I wouldn’t book anywhere else. Thank you for such a lovely stay.,positive
"Location great, bar great, breakfast nice but limited hot food",positive
"The locker that basically is a drawer under your bed had some problem with the spring and you would be very loud if you decide to take smth from it which is kind of awkward during late hours. 
Bring you padlock!,

Stuff was great. Bed was clean and comfy and well equiped - you could charge your gadgets easy with some nice lantern over your head that also alowes you to read at night or watch porn aslo :)  
The bed has a curtain which is also a huge advantage. the ledder is not mounted on the lower bed occupants bed frame. 
Shower was good and clean. Bathroom was ok.
Bar was crowdy and loud that is great. Good beer options. 
you can bring your food there and eat. In the morning also the stuff member said no probs with that. 
You can drink juice for free in the morning and coffee. (In civilized amounts)
Transport is 100m away. 24 hours market is 200m away. Calm and quiet street.",positive
"An air conditioner would have been appreciated for the price paid. There seemed to be a party going on the first evening I was there which made it difficult to sleep.,

Standard room not really in the centre",positive
"On arrival we were told the hostel arrival policies were changing and we had to check-in at the bar, which was busy at the time. But not a big deal and we were able to order a drink and check-in at the same time.Also there was a £3 charge for towels. Fine as this was mentioned in the policies, but when the towels are only available during (short) reception opening hours, it was hard to ever get the towels!,

Nice external courtyard on arrival, with an on-site bar overlooking. Room was very spacious for a three single bed room and had a separate seating area and shower room.The bar was reasonably priced. Area was quite central and easy to walk into the main centre of Brussels.",positive

The breakfast was good. Good location, easy walk to the Grand Place. Room was big enough.",positive
"Delivered 100% on its promises, great location and breakfast. Highly recommended.",positive
"Some of the staff were genuinely nice while others seemed like they were forcing it. I don't know if all the staff know the costs of their towels and how much they should give back for the room card deposit. I was in too much of a hurry to realize at the moment, but instead of getting 1 euro for the card and 3 for the towel I just got 2 euro in return. It's a small amount but 1 or 2 euro here or there and it adds up,

Even though I was in a 16-person room it didn't feel like that at all. The layout of the room is great and the curtains on the bed give you quite a bit of privacy. It's close to the windmill walk and in a location where you can see Brugge without loads of tourists walking around",positive
"Breakfast were poor. Personal were unpleasant and rude. Such level of services were overvalued. Hotel facility not very exciting. Administration lacks English skills.,

Breakfast do not fullfill European standards. We were served with cutlets and Olivier salad. They were out off coffee. Desserts were disgusting. We were the only clients at that morning. During eating, while not finished, personel began to serve out meals and commanded us to go away.",negative

"Very clean, very friendly staff and lots of space. We felt very comfortable for our weekend stay. The children's playroom was a very welcome bonus. Fantastic, would book again.",positive
"As we travelled during winter, the heating was unfortunately not sufficent both in the room and bathroom. Second room was extremely cold and humid where was not really possible to sleep in. ,


Otherwise everything was great. Natasha was a great host, she explained us how to get best to Gent and where to park, what to see etc  and the house was located in a great area with a beautiful garden where we could have our morning coffee and enjoy the winter sun🤗 
It was very close and easy to reach Gent center by car and there was free parking at home, so another plus☺️
We would like to stay there also in spring or summer, we are sure it's going to be even a better experience and we will love it. 
So in general, the neighbourhood, the garden, the room, the bathroom (which is also important for me), all were great!
Thank u Natasha and see you next time🥰",positive

"I really can't write any negative comments about this hotel.,

The central location was ideal for all my requirements during my stay. Being alone I felt safe and secure at all times. For my next visit to Minsk I will use this hotel again and will recommend it to others. The room was solid, spacious, and well soundproofed.",positive

The building and the restaurant are nice.",negative
What you see is what you get! beautiful apartment with an easy and central location! worth the stay!!,positive
"We were not informed about the parking risks on the streets nearby . There are plenty of road works nearby and we could not park on the streetBut the receptionist said it was fine to park nearby, rue de l ArgonneSo we did. Yet the car was towed away overnight because of the market taking place there the following morning. We had to pay 223,60 euros to get the car back and waste half a day to go through the whole process. We are now expecting compensation from the hotel as we were not informed about that risk and the receptionist knew the area was going through tough times because of the road works. She did not warn us at all.",negative

Veronique and Paul are the perfect hosts!",positive

Beijing Hotel located in a park area. Everywhere is green.",negative

Location was good, just 10 min by feet to centrum of Brussel.Room and the beds were big.It was silent.",negative
"The view of the courtyard wasn't great. Also, we have to call the maid before leaving for check the mini-bar - my girlfriend said that is not a good thing nowadays.,

Quite clean and quiet.",positive
"To start with, it was very strange that half of the amenities in the hotel were not working because they were broken / unavailable. I have NEVER encountered this in a 5* hotel. For instance, the bathtub in our room was broken - water was not flowing into the bathtub because the pipes were broken or unattached to the tub, for this reason water was flowing below the tub and not in it. We have checked under the tub and the entire space  was wet and mouldy. The shower head was not very well attached (or full of limescale), so the water was flowing outside the shower head and not through it. The shower tile was chipped. In the men's area of the spa,  jacuzzi was not working. How is this acceptable in a 5* hotel???
The staff appears to be not very well trained. Some members of the staff were very nice and helpful while others were downright rude. We have ordered a couple of items from the mini bar; as the mini bar was not filled upon our arrival, the lady came up to our room carrying all the contents of the mini bar. Trying to save her some trouble, I have told her that we only need a couple of items, so there is no need to fill the entire mini bar. She said quite rudely that this is not a restaurant so I cannot order whatever I want and proceeded to fill the entire mini bar. I am pretty sure that she could approached the matter differently. Some staff members do not speak English. If you address them in English they freak out and pass you along to their colleague. When they do speak English, they come out quite rude, e.g. asking ""what do you want?"" instead of ""how can I help you?"". Again, the lack of proper training is prominent. I have stayed in similarly priced 5* hotels in other countries and the staff goes above and beyond to ensure quality experience for their guests.
To be fair, we have not tried the breakfast, so maybe it would have improved our experience (breakfast was highly rated among other quests).,

I have very mixed emotions about this hotel. While I liked some aspects of it (beautiful lobby, spacious rooms, down pillows and duvet, cleanliness), some things have really let me down.",negative

"They have a bar on the hostel which was really good and the service formidable. also the breakfast was delicious and is included with in the price.The room was really good and the size was great.",positive
"When we got there we could barely get into the entrance of the hotel because the whole road in front of the hotel was completely dug up and there were major works being undertaken.  We had not been notified of this prior to our stay which is what normally happens.  Having stayed in Brussels on another occasion not far from the Grand Place, were weren't as comfortable with the surroundings around the hotel.,

We were staying a couple of nights prior to catching the Eurostar to London so the proximity to the train station was perfect.  The room size was really good, big shower and the toilet was in a separate room.",negative
"Two twin beds stuck together don't make a double bed! The rooms are rather small and suffer from a lack of storage place (please add a towel rack!!). The pool is also quite small.,

Located outside of town, sufficiently far away from the main road to be quiet yet very close to all amenities, the Daft Hotel is nested in a meadow next to the forest. There you find a modern building that also serves as recording studio. The music theme is thus predominant, both in the commons and in the rooms. We particularly enjoyed (for free) the swimming pool, the snooker table, and the home cinema room (cast from the iPad/Netflix that is provided at your arrival). The breakfast was also excellent, featuring a lot of fresh products from local producers. The relatively small size of the place makes it very pleasant to spend time in the numerous cosy living rooms that are open to the guests, fully equipped with sofas, books, music, and coffee machines.",positive

I'm not sure , location and design",negative
"1) . I booked it  over one month before I started my journey, I did hope I could have the peacful relax juring the stay, but they told me I will move to another room after two nights, I asked why, there were a big travle group will come soon, their anwsered. I had to do my packing and checked outbefore 10 am, and then checked in after 3 pm, that means there were 5 hours out of the servic , and my rest time was disturbed rughly, I do hope they would have some suitable way later.,

The work starf were friendly, the breakfast is ok, the room was clear. It's very nice that the hostel is located next to the river.",positive

"Perfect escape for a few days from COVID lockdown in beautiful town and region. Spacious room, with great views over the river, fridge and table in the room to enjoy your take away food. Perfect location, meters away from restaurants, town attractions and walking routes.  Very friendly owner always willing to help or advice. So kind he gave me a free ride to train station in nearby town. Family also owns good restaurant for take away and offers very solid breakfast to be deliver at your apartment in the morning.",positive

I stayed there for 11 times. Good place, I really enjoy it",positive
"My room entrance was right next to entrance to the property. On last night there was quite some traffic on the outer door which was a bit disruptive. Admittedly i'm a light sleeper so most would likely not care.On same note, it would be nice to have a safety chain/latch on the door to have it surely locked when in room.,

Beautifully decorated room, excellent location with no noise from street regardless of extremely central location. Comfy bed and good pressure in shower. Coffee/tea facilities available on common areas.Edmund is a fabulous host and available for any needs that might arise.",positive
"Mini bar was empty just by request . Rooms mixed with offices . Pre authorization on card more than the booking then if you jump the limit you need to go to reception and pay the difference to get the service like doing message etc . Message room is another level from the indoor pool and spa .
Sauna and jacuzzi it’s separate for male and female , defiantly not for couples . Too complicated for a 5 star hotel didn’t feel it at all . ,

Comfortable bedding , beautiful entrance and nice indoor pool area",positive

New hotel with brand new rooms. Great breakfast delivered to our door. Restaurant of the owner offered take away dinner to eat in the room. Amazing Italian food!,positive
"It’s a little further from main square (and train station) than I thought but still OK. A bus stops close by. The shower turns off every few seconds, you have to keep pushing a button to keep it running.,

Comfortable room, decent size. I was in a 5 bed dorm and had a single bed rather than a bunk bed which was good. Clean toilets and showers. Good bar downstairs. Breakfast is either free (if you book directly with hostel) or only 5 euro, it’s great value for money.",positive
VERY helpful staff at the reception !,positive
"This place is a little gem hidden on a quiet street in the city center. I was just staying for one night, but it would be wonderful placer a longer stay.  The loft-kind room is very spacious, with sitting area, kitchen and dining table, sleeping space and a spacious bathroom. The host Edmund is really friendly. 10 points from me.",positive
"The receptionists were just polite enough,  but not at all friendly - strange for a five star hotel. The air conditioning made too much noise - we had to turn it off for the night (and the hotel kindly asks you to keep the windows closed due to bothering insects from the surrounding park). And I somewhat did not like the smell in the bathroom - nothing really bad, but not fresh enough, either,

Rooms are clean and spacy. We got an extra bike rental - a great idea, remembering the hotel's park location. The lobby bar keeps amontillado jerez on stock. The 19 meter pool is very good.",positive
Lift service is very slow,negative
"However, the trip was marred by the fact that I had my phone stolen outside the hotel! The hotel is not situated a particularly nice area, although very convnenient for the Eurostar.,

Cannot fault the hotel for cleanliness and friendliness of staff, who attended to anything we asked. The hotel facilities were great and the breakfast was really good value and lots of choice.",positive
"No wifi that time, some of the lights are not working. ,

Nice location, approachable staff.",positive
"Few things could be better: not all staff members could speak English to a decent level, single bed was on the small end and the pillows could be more comfortable.,

Really good looking hotel with lots of nice extras, friendly staff and nice breakfast. There has been a lot of attention invested in the hotel and you can surely see that. Loved the check-in box with the iPad and the common bar.",positive
Location is great! It’s like little luxury space where you feel cosy and comfortable,positive
"I stayed at the building next door. My window faced an alley and there were people there talking most of the time. They could really use a pub crawl...,

Great location, ease of parking, amazing facilities, coolest bar ever, and very friendly staff!",positive
"Some elements of the hotel would need a little refurbishment. Despite an overall good quality of the facilities, it appears that some of them are in place since a certain amount of time. A clearer pricing system for the room service would be appreciated.,

The kindliness of the reception staff and the super central location of the hotel are great pluses. Most of the museums and local attractions are within a walking distance from the hotel. Hotel was clean, and the procedures were fast and professional. I'd recommend the hotel for short stays.",positive
Perfect location and lovely room. Cereal and croissants for breakfast was a nice touch.,positive
Restoran staff did not speak english,positive

Great room, conveniently located, comfy bed, modern bathroom, and has a parking space. There is a nice/small patio area outside as well.",positive

Good value for the money, close to the central station and city center",positive
"The atmosphere around the hotel made us feel quite unsafe, the area was dirty and run down. However, when the road works along the road of the hotel are complete this may improve. We walked into the centre on the first day but the people nearby made us feel uneasy so we got ubers for the rest of our trip.,

The hotel itself was lovely, clean and modern. The room was very spacious and had everything we needed. It was roughly a 5 minute walk from the train station so was very handy as we had lots of bags to carry!",positive

The location is great and the mix with industrial and nature makes it a great place to relax!",positive
"Everything was great, but one downside was the pillows, that were way too thick. It's a personal preference of course, but for us, we couldn't sleep and it brought pain neck during the night. Had to sleep without it.,

The room was beautiful, new and clean! Very comfortable bed and nice shower. The location was great. Only thing is that next time we will bring our own pillows.",positive

The location was great and close to the Metro. Easy to make your way from the train station. 
The rooms were spacious with lockers provided and shelves and cubby holes to store luggage. The room also had its own shower and toilet so that was a nice surprise.
Each bed had its own light and plug.
Breakfast was ok.
The staff I dealt with were nice and friendly.",positive

A modern hotel with offering an nice concept that has the advantages of feeling at home but being taken care as in an hotel. As different leisure rooms (wellness, billiard, home cinema,..) and a nice common room with a fire and sofas.",positive
"mattress can be a bit more comfortable.,

central location, clean rooms, parking included. Overall a very good value for travelers. I would recommend spending a couple nights in Durbuy to discover the area.",positive
"There was no soap in the bathroom.,

I forgot some jewelry at the hostel and I was already on the train to Brussels when I realized. The staff were so incredibly helpful, they immediately went looking for my belongings and sent them to me within two weeks. Much appreciated!",positive
It was the 2nd time I’ve stayed in Hotel Minsk. I’m a happy and satisfied client! Staff is great and the whole place is clean. Room service also fast and good quality.,positive
"The water pressure was too low.,

The interior was modern with very nice furniture. The room was well lit with several lamps and convenient switches and outlets. The location was exceptional, in a local part of town that is close to bars and walkable to many of Brussels's good restaurants. The hosts were friendly and personable. The breakfast items were always available for snacks and the tea selections were amazing. I actually went and bought the exact same two tea blends because I loved them so much! It felt like I was staying at a 5-star hotel.",positive
"My first room had a lot of technical issues- water, airing , etc so I hadcto change rooms.Confusion about deposits paid. Room locked despite agreed late check out, let’s say a number of admin issues.,

Nice location in the park and beautiful pool!",negative
"Matresses and pillows were not that comfortable. Breakfast menu felt a bit poorer, can be improved.,

Wi-fi was fast. Toilets and shower inside our room were quite clean. Bathroom had a luxurious feeling compared to the other hostels I’ve stayed in. Sheets were clean, too.",positive
"The construction outside the hotel. It was very muddy which damaged our footwear,

The bed was very comfortable and the shower was a lovely size with good running hot water",positive
"This could have been the most magical of experiences but for a few issues that could be easily remedied. 
The welcome by the waiting staff was v bad, however, subsequent relations were 5*. The place is breathtaking and the pics do not do it justice. There are too many table cloths and fabric throws, it makes the place look dusty and tired and the ornamental decorations are not to everyones taste. Declutter the place, the mood would still reflect its age but be far more pleasing, a little modern but with the ancient  ties are what's required. The bathroom needs attention and repair as an old knorr soup bucket under the leaking washand basin is v poor and detracts from the luxurious toiletries offered.  Please mention the terrace, it was wonderful to sit out with a warm drink and enjoy the priceless views. Would I return? Absolutely!!,

The location, the bed, the bath, outdoor space and did I mention the location?",positive

Clean. Nice staff. Modern. Relaxed. Easy going. No worries",positive

Not Air-conditioned  or air circulation. ,

Clean, mattress was very comfortable. Big room. Close to everything. .",positive
"Really nothing not too like about this place. Bar can be a bit noisy when trying to sleep.,

The reception staff on arrival are really friendly. With a quick and easy way to check in. I arrived well before the schedule check in time but was sorted in minutes. The facilities are very well located on all floors. With more than enough toilet and shower even at peak times.",positive
"Staff needed a reminder to fix the locked bathroom door. But after the reminder it didn't even take two minutes for somebody to come and repair it.,

Friendly staff and a central locationIncidentally left an item behind in the room and luckily the hotel didn't immediately dispose it but actually kept it and is currently in the process of sending it back to me. Very good service!",positive
"It was clean, the staff was hospitable and the location is great!",positive
"location
Break fast",positive
Being just a 5 minute walk from Eurostar and a 15 minute walk from the Grand Place was just fantastic. The room was spacious and clean and the staff were very kind and accommodating. Even though the hotel is situated on a busy road the rooms were very quiet due to great sound proofing. During the night there was a very disruptive guest in another room but within 5 minutes of ringing reception silence returned to the hotel. Leaving our cases at reception on our last day while we continued to visit the Christmas markets to pick them up before catching our train just helped for a stress free weekend. Great customer service!,positive
"No breakfast included,

Location, bedroom style, view on the main square.",positive
"Very friendly staff, modern clean and comfortable accommodation. Close to Malmedy and surrounding area, good facilities well worth a visit.",positive
"The hotel it self is really hard to find because the is no sign outside or at the building itself (only at the window) and Google maps sends you to a restaurant which is called  l'incontournable wich is pretty comfusing. You got to walk into this restaurant, wich is owned by the hotel owner, to check in and then he wil explain where the hotel is. It would be much more convenient if there was a sign at the restaurant 'le durbuysien' and at the font of the hotel itself,

Very nice room and bathroom located at the heart of Durbuy. There is a private parking behind the hotel for 10 euro's per week wich is cheap because you Will pay 12 euro's per 12 h of parking in the rest of the city. We parked our car for free just outside the city at the Pre Georis parking (beautifull 15 min walk)",positive
"The room was extremely basic. To be expected in a hostel but being made to pay for a small tube of shampoo after booking a private with en-suite felt a bit much considering they didn’t even provide a facecloth. The location was further from the centre than I thought.,

The room was large and comfortable. We had a room Away from the street so it was surprisingly quiet.",positive
"My expectations were met so nothing to complain about.,

Very friendly and helpful staff.Breakfast.Amazing room and nice street view.",positive
We had a great stay here.  It was clean and comfortable.  The host was very responsive and easily reached.  He was very kind to meet us 2 hours later than he expected because I had given him the wrong arrival time.  The location is fabulous and we would definitely stay again.  He provided us with lots of information regarding restaurants and things to do.,positive
"The plugs in the rooms should be more than one and close to each bed. The breakfast was very ""basic"", I suggest including some more types of dishes, even with a small fee.,

Very tidy room, the personnel is really professional and the general building is awesome. Really cheap price, can't ask for much more.",positive
"Roadworks outside made street muddy,

needed a central Brussels hotel and this fits the bill-walking distance from Gare du Midi. Street outside being dug up and in the rain was very muddy.",positive
Stunning huge room over looking the market place. Best place I’ve ever stayed...,positive
"Having a light in the shower would be nice and a water bottle in the room would be appreciated too, other than this, perfect",positive
"It was not clear where the reception was. It took us 10 minutes to notice we had to go to a restaurant 150m away, to ask for the keys. But once that was over and done with, we had an incredible stay!,

The space in the room! Big and comfortable bed, with good pillows. No noises, very clean!",positive
"Location is awesome! There is also a bar (literally the next building from the hostel), where you can get snacks and beer. It’s been a great stay and can definitely recommend others to stay around for a day or two at St. Christopher’s Inn :-)",positive
".... on the first night there was quite a big party in the next room. I called the personel 3 times yet they couldn't handle those animal guests. The neighbours were actually making fun of them and the security was completely helpless. In the end, I couldn't fell asleep that night until 4:00 A.M. Second thing - the restaurant. It is definitely too small for the size of the hotel. Between 7:30 and 9:30 it is nearly impossible to find a place for yourself. You need to sit with someone from another room. The food is really nice but please, set more tables for the guests.,

Location - the city center at its best, 7 minutes by walk to the ""Tsentralny"". Comfort and cleanliness - above my expectations. The rooms (we had two singles) were actually soundproof from the noise of the street",positive
"Nothing!,

Host was superb and friendly, and so was his cat! The room was modern, spacious, very clean and cosy. Was pretty much right in the centre, everywhere was walking distance.",positive
"The bathroom has mould in it, no foot towels so very slippy and dangerous, people were very loud inside and outside. The beds weren't made so hard to do this in the evening with everyone asleep very hot in the rooms even with windows open,

The staff were friendly helpful , breakfast was good, good location and facilities. Maps given were helpful and good transport links",positive
"Les travaux publiques devant l'hotel,

It's a small hotel (70 rooms) comfortable, friendly staff, hotel location very convenient accessible (4minutes walking from the station). In the same streets restaurants and supermarkets. Walking distance 15 minutes to Grand-Place.",positive
"Bed wasn’t the most comfortable, no amenities. ,

Location, size and charm of the rooms.",positive
"In reality there were quite a few issues. This is meant as constructive criticism...
- The road to the place has a massive ramp and you would want a sign at the end of the road where to turn, as you’re being blinded by the path lighting. It was icy but the paths weren’t cleared. 
- Rooms were very dark. Bathrooms were even darker, like a cave.
- No heating in the bathroom
- No hand soap, so had to get shower soap every time
- Bathrobes would have been great. 
- Please ask your guests to take a shower after the sauna, rather the jumping into the pool all sweaty. That’s disgusting. Maybe also ask them to generally take a shower before jumping into the pool. And to not flood the sauna by going directly from pool to sauna.
- A changing room downstairs would be great.
- There’s hardly and storage space in the room. A tiny shelf and 3 coat hangers is maybe a bit too minimal for a double room.
- Since there isn’t that much to do for kids, you’ll have every spot occupied by bored kids (pool, sauna, billiard, lounge, cinema). Maybe you could have a kids free time at the pool? Seems like the cinema and billiard don’t really crack it for kids these days, so they just sit in the lounge playing mobile games all day long, making it hard to relax for everyone else.
- The cinema is fun, unless someone starts a pokemon stream from their room but don’t actually occupy the cinema
- Most of this wouldn’t be a problem if you could chill in your room, but the walls are so thin we could hear our neighbors breathe!!! And snore and use the toilet and moan and play guitar hero for 4 hours. Totally unacceptable for a building used as a hotel.
- It’s a new building but there’s no elevator, so good luck if you’re on second floor and brought some luggage,

Theoretically this place has it all, modern/cool spot, lounge with fireplace, wellness, great surroundings, cinema, bar... All the staff were amazing and the breakfast was lovely. Could be perfect a retreat. But...",positive
"the adress of location is not precise, it is a adress of owners restaurant and the arrival was confusing a bit,

Very comfortable accomodation ( appartmenthouse) in the city center, spacy and clean room with all comfort, nice view on the river, parking in front of house, breakfast can be done next door in some restaurants",positive
"Shared bathroom a bit of a pain as there was only 1 accessible from within our ""apartment"".  Wifi worked but was slow.,

Cool hostel close to centre of Bruges.  Bar attached to reception which got lively in evenings.  Room was basic but very comfy mattress and pillow. Bikes available for hire for very cheap, plus good recommendations for tours etc.",positive
"It's remarkably hard to find the (lamp) switches in the dark. When I arrived it was pitch black and rather a challenge to navigate the room!Bathroom was sizeable and well appointed.,

Great welcoming staff and the view over Lenin Square is obviously great.",positive
"There was an expired moldy bread left in the closet though lol,

Quality studio and really quite environment. The location is awesome, everything near by foot. Nice balcony and coffee machine!",positive
"there are stairs to get to the rooms, so you can't bring heavy luggage,

Nice people at the reception, nice bar with interesting beer options. Close to train station, I got an uber for 5 euro (i could have walked if I had lighter luggage)",positive
"Smell from sewers kept drifting through into room - think from the works outside.,

Location perfect for train station, but spoilt by so many building works that blocked easy access to hotel. Room comfortable.",negative
Amazing suite with amazing views. Absolutely huge room and so much better than expected of a ‘guest house’,positive
"For a hotel attached to a recording studio, I did not expect to have radio blasting in the common spaces. Would it be difficult to play some record or a playlist?The lightning in the room was dim.,

This is a bit unusual hotel, very tiny rooms, but very nice common spaces. The living room with the views towards nature was wonderful. Breakfast was lovely, the small pancakes brought to the table were supper fluffy and melting in the mouth. The pool is tiny and a bit cold, but our kids enjoyed it.It was very quiet at night.",positive
It was a bit difficult to find because the check-inn was not at the same address.,positive

Spacious and tidy.",positive

It takes nearly a day to have answer and the welcome was Perfect but then i was told that for the second night we have only to change the room and then , that there wasn’t a room anymore .

Fantastically different and refreshing nothing not to like!",positive
"Very stylish and comfortable room in the heart of little Durbuy. Bed was really comfortable, great facilities, and we were able to have breakfast next door at the Hotel La Librairie in the morning (€12 pp). The owner Sebastian was very nice and helpful, helped us find the room and park, and advised us where to eat. The town itself is gorgeous, well worth a visit, even in the rain.",positive
"The showers! They shut off every 3 seconds which made it really difficult to actually shower. Bathroom got pretty dirty on our last day there but had been ok otherwise. Theres nowhere to sit down in the room (bunks are so low you cant sit up), and no ""living room"" type space or place to relax other than the pub downstairs. We wanted to be able to make/eat our own food but there was no place to do that (kitchen or place to sit and eat).,

Room was big, bed was comfy, location was decent (30 min walk from train station but close to everything else). Pub always had great music playing!",positive

Good choices at breakfast. Water in room.",positive

"kitchen and building
And breakfast",positive
"The area around is not so nice, but in 15 min walking you are in the city centre, so very close!! But we would not like to walk there at night alone (two woman). Parking is with 25 euros also a bit expensive. But nevertheless i would really recommend the hotel. ,

Breakfast was delicious, the rooms are big and comfortable and we booked it because of the whirpool :) and used it after a long day of walking!",positive
"We asked about a taxi the night before we left, as we needed to be at the train station by 8:30. We asked for a taxi at 8:00 am.  The staff said they would arrange the taxi for us.  We went down in the morning at 8:00 and no taxi.  We asked the one staff person there, but she could not call us a taxi.  We had no cell phone service to call ourselves.  We subsequently missed our train and has to cancel a touring stopped we planned to make.  We are very disappointed in the staff.,

"It is very difficult to work out how the room key turns the lights on. We spent ages trying to find a dark attachment on a dark wall to turn the lights on. It's not just us - another guest had to ask us how to do this too. ,

Very nice rooms with good air conditioning. I slept perfectly. Nice view from my room of a huge square and nearby fashionable restaurants, like o.d.i. and cafe de paris.",positive
"Comfortable, quiet room in central location in Brussels.  Edmund was a friendly, engaging host who offered tips and suggestions for restaurants, transportation, etc., in and outside of the city;  he also kept our luggage after check-out and allowed us to pick it up later in the afternoon.",positive
"i was in belgium for 12 days and although i travelled to other cities i booked accommodation only in brussels to avoid the hassle of moving hostels. imagine my surprise when i was forced to change rooms halfway through my stay (had to leave my room by midday store my stuff in luggage and come to a new room after 3pm basically checking out and back in later that day) and this was not communicated to me before i checked in - major inconvenience as i would not have stayed in brussels the entire time had i known this in time. on top of that the girl at front desk acted like she did me a favour by ensuring i didn't have to change rooms TWICE. first room was in an unincorporated area of the hostel only reachable through emergency stairs, no easy access to the kitchen, weird layout (two levels, stairs in weird places, sinks next to beds), unstable bunk beds, too few outlets and the only light was for the whole room. second room in the front part of the hostel was tiny and cramped, stuffy and the only window opened pretty much directly into the street. access to kitchen is very limited. wifi is spotty in parts and some of the staff is not particularly informative. the two parts of the hostel are completely separate which makes for a strange layout if you are in the wrong part.,

relatively close to both central and north station on foot or by traffic. well connected to public transport with stops for all metro lines as well as several buses and trams closeby. a number of attractions within walking distance including the congress column, botanical garden, brussels park, parliament, royal palace and grand place. a delhaize and carrefour store nearby as well as a couple of fast food places and pubs. overall in a good location.
the hostel itself is clean and well maintained. it has a lot of extra facilities including a luggage room and a well equipped kitchen, a cheap bar,  a balcony, a sitting area both inside and out, a laundry room and its own vending machines.  check in/check out is possible from early in the morning to late in the evening. staff speaks multiple languages and they are all very pleasant and polite. in collaboration with an agency a guide for a free walking tour picks up groups from the hostel twice a day which is very convenient. different free maps are available at front desk. there's free access to computers and the staff will print out your bus or plane tickets for free too.
the breakfast is great. there are a lot of different things to choose from, sweet and savory, different kinds of cured meat and cheese, eggs, butter, chocolate spreads, jams, different types of bread and milk (including soy milk) and cereal. there's always several types of fresh fruit. you can drink anything from water to juice to coffee to hot chocolate to all kinds of tea. the dining area has a toaster and a microwave. over a longer period it gets repetitive and it's not a replacement for a varied home-cooked diet, but it's a great hostel breakfast.
the rest of the experience depends largely on where in the hostel you are placed. my first room was very large and spacious with lots of windows, air and light. it was in a quiet part of the hostel overlooking a quiet street.",positive
"The area is run down, and in need of renovation.,

A genuine 4 Star hotel, Near to railway station, and the staff were great,",positive
"Location was perfect and the view from our room was amazing. 
The room was huge and our little boy had his own bedroom which made it feel more like home from home.",positive
"Very early check out and quite late check timings. For the price, the check out should be until 12:00pm at least. ,

The hotel is built in a really nice area and in harmony with the surrounding nature! Staff are friendly and there was a nice ambience in the living room and cafeteria.",negative
"Good location at center of Durbuy. Friendly host, who also speaks dutch and is very cooperative regarding requests. Note that address was a restaurant to 'check in' (owned by same family); room itself is located at different part of the center of Durbuy (I think even better than given address).",positive
"The rooms are quiet basic and are becoming a little rundown, but not too badly yet. Breakfast is not included when you reserve with booking but is when you reserve through the hostel directly.,

Located close to the windmills, and a short walk from the center. Nice backpacker atmosphere. Friendly and helpful staff. Good beer selection at the hostel bar!",positive
Excellent location in the heart of Minsk; friendly and helpful staff; good value for the price,positive
"Could have added a complimentary waffle! But seriously, no complaints, genuinely excellent experience.,

Great location, lovely comfortable, spacious room with beautiful silence and deep darkness at night. The most restful nights sleep you can hope for. The host is amazing, so accomodating and friendly.",positive
The hostel was easy to find on the map. Located not far from the city centre and main tourist attractions. I was really pleased with variety of food for breakfast. Staff were very friendly and helpful.,positive
Fantastic location on the Great Market. Great room with super view.,positive
"Glamping way too overpriced (Formula 1 weekend),

Good breakfast, however a bit strange to seperate Hotel and Glamping as it is done",negative
"The coffee in the room can be better, though you are a 1 minute walk away from very good coffee in cafes and restaurants.,

Le Durbuysien is simply fantastic. It is right in the heart of Durbuy, a stone's throw from all of the restaurants and shops in town, and the walking/hiking trail heads. The staff is very friendly, the bed is deluxe, and the room is quite spacious for 1-2 people. We highly recommend this to other travelers!",positive
"Didn’t realise until checking out that you can bring your own food and drink because there are two parts to the pub/hanging out area. 
Rooms just designed for sleeping in and nothing else. 
We were in the end room down the hall and the Wifi was terrible, no A/C, the shared toilets definitely need to be cleaned more. 
You have to keep pressing a button every 5 sec to make the shower work. 
,

10mim walk to the centre. Easy access via bus to the main train station. 
Good price and good to have a beer in their pub on site.",negative
"Nothing I could think of:),

This is the most central hotel in Minsk from which one can easily get to the major attractions in the city as well as places to eat. The twin room we were staying in was on the spacious side overlooking the main street which is during most part of the day busy making noise and exhaust fumes - so there was no chance to open the window even in the evening. At the same time, the air-conditioning worked very well which meant there was no much need in letting cooler air in from the outside. The room and the whole property were very clean and tidy. On top of that, the staff at the reception and on the floor were extremely polite and welcoming which added up to the overall impression of the property and the offered facilities and conveniencies. The wireless worked well giving no hindrances or hassles. I will definitely stay at this hotel next time once I travel to central Minsk again.",positive

The events outside",negative
"-: This is not a hotel. This is more a bed and breakfast. There's no reception, no lounge , no central hall and no hotel facilities. No soap to wash your hands. Booking.com filters this accomodation as a hotel which is not correct.
Due to Covid we ate in the room. Meals are possible from the restaurant's owner (meals are good) or from the neighbouring restaurants.
Due to the fact that there are no hotel facilities, you only have the room. Therefore it's a bit overpriced.,

+: Ecellent location, clean room and friendly hosts. Breakfast was very good even without butter being available.",negative
"Just a little thing, not big deal 
When I arrived, around 20:00 hs, and went to my room and bed, discover that just the mattress haven't got sheets, the pillow did.
A forgetfulness, can happen.
When I've gone to the receptionist to comment about it, immediately went to handle it.
All my thanks!! That's how a situation should always be managed!
Didn't like that the distance between the lower and the upper beds, was really short. I'm tall, and there's no chance I could sit normally... or any way without be very bowed.
Neither liked much some parts of the stairs (narrow, unbalanced steps, low ceiling), nor some showers (same reasons, except for the steps, which haven't got)
I was at the ""old building"", the one above the bar,

Breakfast was really great!
My room for 12 was divided in 3 spaces/rooms, which each had their own lavatory.
The bar it's very good, with a very wide offer of Belgian beers, some cocktails, and you can order pizza (€7) up to midnight!",positive
"As a family with 2 small children the property was hard to access with a double stroller due to lots of stairs. Otherwise it’s great.,

Great location, great ambiance, lots of bars and restaurants nearby",positive
"Toilet and shower private, but outside the room.",positive
"Need better pillows for sleeping...they were uncomfortable,

Loved loved the location!!!   Loved the beautiful architecture and lovely windows in our room.Was super roomy and nice.  The restaurant at hotel is delicious as well.",positive
"too noisy,

nice in the centre",negative
Breakfast was one of the best hostel breakfasts I encountered in two months. Location was about 15 minute easy walk from the centre. Rooms are really nice and the beds have curtains (!!) and lamps and power points. Only downside is that the only lockable thing in the room is a crate under the bed - a bit inconvenient but it keeps your valuables secure so no worries. Staff were absolutely lovely and the bar has a really great vibe.,positive
Perfect location and very comfortable room. Would absolutely stay here again and recommend to anyone looking for a quiet spot near the heart of Brussels.,positive
"The hostel has youth in its title (and my receipt) but I ended up sharing a room with a 50 years old guy.,

The location is superb. The indoor bathroom is very decent and convenient. Along with overall general facilities and cleanliness.",positive
"None,

Beautiful and comfortable room. The hotel room exceeded my expectation! I felt like a queen in this spacious room which had beautiful paintings and huge Belgian lace in a glass frame. Great view of the Grote Markt and had a good view of the parade and festivities in the square. I loved the Belgian Waffle served in the hotel for breakfast!",positive
"The given address is a bar that belongs to the owner and is very difficult to find - I needed approx. 10min to understand the situation. The price is much too high for the quality of this small room with minimal extras - but well, you are central.With a good breakfast which could be offered as the bar offers this for extra-payment, the price would be acceptable but not like this.,

The ""hotel"" is a room in a private house that is very nicely renovated and absolutely central.",negative
"The hostel is like a maze.. ,

I stayed at 5 beds room on the top floor
Quiet and comfy bed",negative

"On top floor no showers, only one toilet.",positive
Everything was great,positive
"Honestly- nothing!  The fact that it is over a restaurant felt interesting rather than odd, unique in a great way.,

We were totally bowled over by how wonderful our room was, it was so special for our first romantic trip together!  The bed was so comfortable and luxurious, a bathtub in the room, bathrobes and slippers,  fridge, coffee machine.  Windows overlooking Market square, it was just magical!",positive
"Close to everything,  everyone was generally very friendly.",positive
"Loved the location! Just perfect. Lovely apartment, within walking distance to everything. A little noise from the square into the early hours but all well worth it.",positive

The property was lively and enjoyable. Also, they served one of the best pizzas I have ever had.",positive
"Located quite close to the unique site of Niglingspo and to Caves de Remouchamps, it is a pity that it is overlooked by a huge aerial bridge , part of the E25 highway!,

Flat offering two spacious bedrooms,  a fully equipped modern kitchen, nice bathroom including even an individual sauna! A terrace with a little garden is there for you, as well",positive
"Nothing, it was more than we expect. ,

The hospitality was overwelming. The house and garden are great. Felt like home. Everything was so nice and clean. For a couple as well for a family with children i recommend Gite les gadlis. The location is perfect, everything is near by. When you love the nature and his beauty, dont doubt and book. You dont regret!",positive
"The outside temperature was above 30 Celsius so it got quite hot under the roof. ,

The location and view of the lake is absolutely amazing. Worth every penny.
Good mini bar with selection of specialty beers.",positive
"All was nice and very comfortable,

Very clean and comfortable apartment, ideal for a trip with friends. Common area is quite spacious with a nice terrace.",positive
"Great place, warm and cozy, green garden (our dog was verry happy there:) ) friendly hosts, good localization, Aywaille- beautiful area.
For sure we will come back soon :)",positive
It's a really beautiful location by the lake and within walking/cycling/driving distance of Ypres. We rented bikes from the property which were modern and comfortable and cycled around the lake. The only things around are farms and nature. Breakfast was good and the owners were really friendly and helpful. We left a phone charger in the room and the owner came to find us in Ypres to give it back. Would definitely recommend.,positive
"We called the owner 2h before arrival to let him know when we would arrive, and he told us we could pick up the key at the restaurant below the appartment. But when we arrived we discovered the key was not there and they told us to wait for 5 min. When he still 
wasn't there after 15min we called again and he told us to wait for another 2minutes, without telling us what the problem was. At the end we waited for 1h10min because they hadn't cleaned the appartement yet apparently. This way of communicating (prolonging our waiting time each time without telling us why we actually couldn't enter our appartement) was not very professional. Also once we could enter the apartment we did not get any explication about the appartment. They also forgot to clean the oven, probably because of the hurry. Overall the reception was a disappointment, but the apartment was beautiful!",negative
"Unfortunately the bar closes at 20.30,

Very nice rooms and beautiful views over the city. Good breakfast.",positive
"Getting the key was really easy. The hosts helped us with telling everything about the house. These are the nicest hosts you will ever meet. Amazing people! The house was very clean, full of all things you need for your stay and more! The road outside is a bit busy, so you hear the cars pass by. But overall we've had great stay!",positive
Lovely,positive
"Very nice room, bathroom with shower was very clean, bed was very comfortable!",positive
"The interior had already been renovated, with a superb shower. Now it's time to renew the neon outside and this hotel is again up to speed,

Top location, interior nicely renovated. A hotel with some history, don't expect the newest technology but nevertheless worth the stay!",positive
"- Mediocre breakfast with 15 USD price tag - which is a joke- Cleanliness of the room - I have seen lots of black hair on my carpet in my room as if it was not hover for a long time- My twin room was so small and cluttered with lots of unnecesary furniture and I could not move around with my daughter freely in the room itself- The staff and the hotel manager asked me to pay an extortionary ""fine"" (straf what they called) for my daughter breaking a lamp. When I have refused a price tag that was simply not possible they said they will call the police. They have also said that if I do not pay the hotel cleaner will have to - the handling of this incident and the level of agressiveness was just out of hand and disproportionate. I assess that this Hotel is not ready for foreigners and not understanding of how to treat a guest like a guest. Shaken by the experience overall,

Location and the soviet area monumental building is great - however that is about it. The rest is questionnable and should be avoided",negative
"Nothing. All great!!,

Very clean house and fully equipped. Host provided for us baby equipment. Very kind of them. This is the best appartment accomodation we have ever been to. Extremely reccomended",positive

Charming historic building, nice view from the room over La Roche. Great breakfast and kind staff. Had all the comfort we needed for a stopover.",positive

Perfect location. Great staff in the reception, very helpfull. Good spa.",positive
"Very warm welcome, very homely feeling. Everything we needed was there.",positive

The setting, view on the lake (Zillebeekse vijver); close to the centre of Ypres = half hour walk mostly along the city walls in the park",positive
"Nothing in Hotel,

Hotel was clean, comfortable and staff was really friendly.",positive
"Perhaps slightly more variety in the menu (e.g. some lighter options, salads, etc.) and the children's menu would have been appreciated, given the corona restrictions meant that there were no other opportunities to eat elsewhere,

Food ordered from the room service menu was delicious and beautifully presented.Bed was very comfortable!",positive

"Very  bad internet connectivity. No electricity in the night due to power cuts. Unfriendly and borderline unprofessional staff.,

Great location in the administrative centre of Minsk.",negative
"It was very warm when we were there. An air conditioner would have been very welcome but it's probably not that hot very often.,

Our room had a lovely balcony overlooking the lake to relax on. The room itself was very big with plenty of space for our luggage.  There was a communal kitchen if you don't want to go out for a meal. It is possible to walk into Ypres. It only takes 15 minutes. Parking is plentiful onsite. There are only 4 rooms and it's on a quiet lane so it's not noisy like staying in the town. Very enjoyable. Breakfast had plenty of choices and was delicious.",positive
"The neighborhood isnt plesent. The room are small for a full family (we where 2 adult, one kid and a baby) ,

Nice breakfest. Near the metro",positive
"The mattress was terrible.  Couldn't get comfortable.  It was like sleeping on a flat board. No accomodation made for those with bad backs.   It would have been nice if there was better lounge facilities if you wanted to take a day to rest from traveling.  The furniture in the lobby although stylish is not conducive to relaxation.  It is too low to the ground and not meant for comfort.  The chairs in the dining room again not good for posture. They were meant for style and esthetics.   For hostel travelers, when entering room at midnight dont flip on lights. Please adhere to lights out at 10pm.  I can not begin to tell you the inconsiderate nature of fellow travelers during my  stay.,

Location was very good.  Breakfast was reasonable and satisfying.",negative
"The bathroom was a bit small and non sound-proof, the checkin a bit slow,

Cute hotel at the center of a small village. We loved how the hotel made everything possible to make everything covid-proof, still warm and comfortable (breakfast and dinner in-room, little outdoor chalet for coffee and snacks during the day. Good pizza place just next to the hotel. Great stay overall",positive

"The night receptionist boy was sarcastic and not really helpful when we asked for help. The blanket sheets were not really blanket sheets, just a regular one layer sheet which was not comfortable at all and also, of course that is not good in a way of hygiene. Wifi was super bad, almost did not work at all.,

Everything was ok. The pictures look much better than reality.",negative

Nice big breakfast. The staff is very helpfull. Grat location situated on the edge of the town, at a walking distance to the centre and duper market.",positive

Felt that the bedroom could have been more attentively cleaned,

Great setting - nice view over the fabulously Soviet post office or Lenin square.",positive

UNBELIEVABLE location, one of the best views I ever had. You are in a medieval house, with painted glass windows, and it is just BREATHTAKING. Friendly personnel, nice details (bathrobe, slippers, etc.). AMAZING value for money.",positive

The hotel and facilities were clean. The staff were very helpful. Although it’s beside the raid with train and train the noise did not affect us in the room.",positive
"We came back on Sunday 20.30hs and there was no one at the reception.The elevator was out of service so we have to go up till the 3er floor with our luggage by the stairs.To have to make your own bed. It doesn't include towels (only one for the hands), nor soap for hands. The tap of the sink gave me electricity when I touch it.,

The girl in the reception was nice and give us information. The hotel was clean and tide.Breakfast was really good and you can choose a lot of good drinks and things to eat.",negative

"Nothing. All marvellous!,

Fantastic coach house in a garden with private entrance. Lovely kitchen and sitting area downstairs which really makes you feel at home as you have the whole place to yourself. Good showers in the two double bedrooms. If you are 2 people wanting separate rooms you need to book it for 3 people. Beautifully quiet but only a short stroll to the centre. Well equipped kitchen if you want to sort your own breakfast/ lunch, small supermarket 5 mins away.",positive
I like SCI properties. They were in the process of remodeling part of the bar area so that kind of sucked. But all else was great. Quiet area.,positive
"The hotel is in a very good location right in the centre of Durbuy (everything walking distance).

Beautiful building, excellent breakfast. The morning staff was extremely thoughtful and kind, helping me grab some early snacks and a coffee before I headed out for a hot +30km day on the Transardennaise. The restaurant food was very good if a bit pricey. The town is worth a stay if you’re a book lover!!",positive
"I agree with some others that the place is showing wear. There are some threadbare carpets on the stairs, the decor is very dated and the outside is looking a bit run down. With that in mind is not the cheapest either. The owners passion for paintings somehow adds to the dated feel as they weren't particularly bright. However, the dining room was like the bedrooms.....a little dated but perfectly clean and in decent condition.  No major complaints.,

The hotel is well placed with a short stroll into town and with nice views from our front facing room.  Bedroom was spacious enough, and although the furnishing was not exactly contemporary,  it was clean and in good condition. (Except cracked sink). The bed sheets were crisp and clean and the bathroom was fine. Breakfast was typical fayre and good enough.",positive

Exceptionally clean. One of the most cleanest hostel toilet I've ever been In. Great staff and valuable breakfast. I would recommend this for any kind off traveller.,positive
"The bathroom (which is very clean and modern) is on a mezzanine floor - but I still wish it had a door.,

We were there at the end of September and at that time of year it was a really good place to stay - in the middle of Durbuy and surrounded by tourist shops, bars and restaurants. The room was very clean and comfortable, the staff very helpful and welcoming and the breakfast was excellent- well worth the money.",positive
"The room was hot, but a bit of a heat wave was going on at the time.,

Huge room, incredible view of the town centre",positive
"Seem to be a bit short of staff in some occasions, but anyway they responded well to all we needed.,

The breakfast was outstanding, the best I have ever had in a hotel. I contacted the hotel before my stay to ask please for a good room as it was a special occasion for me and my partner.  They offered us an update of the room if available (unfortunately it was not possible - of course as on August hotels tend to be full), but they have the kindness of giving us a box of chocolates a special gift. Very thoughtful.  We needed an iron and a board and also a couple of hard bags and they supplied to us straight away, we ask for info regarding transport and we were very well informed. When leaving the hotel they asked us if all went alright.",positive
"•Bed didn't have numbers,  If they had numbers, then there would be no discussion over who gets which bed. Plus they had booked one bed for two people, and it was a mess! Finally I didn't found out it was the reservation mistake or the person who had booked, but at the end they brought an extra bed into the room.
•There were nothing close to bed for hanging stuff, and also nothing for hanging stuff in the bathroom.
• Breakfast time was early and short. From 7 to 9. 
•The toilet was outside of the rooms, even for a 4 beds room that I had booked. 
•To me staff were not friendly or maybe I was unlucky! ,

•It was clean.
•Each bed had USB plugs. 
•Each person had 3 space: locker and  2 shelves, which were really really handy! 
• Breakfast was good.
•Big kitchen
• The material of the pillow and mattress, gave me this feeling that no insect can penetrate it, I felt safe 😁",negative

Nice breakfast with excellent croissants",positive
"Room number 210 has really dirty carpet with white and black spots all around the room, also I saw some insects in the room.  I think  because room is  dirty the have prompted my room to suite. The staff reception should give the best room to the customer not the bad. Food menu not in English.,

I was given suite instead of superior double room, the size of rhe bathroom and water wash of the toilet.",negative

"The road Hotel Mercury is on always seemed to have men hanging around it in groups in the evening, it definitely made my husband and myself feel uneasy when walking past them to get into the city or to the lovely restaurants by the station. ,

Room and bathroom were huge, the extra large bed was amazing, the staff were all lovely, really large selection of food at the buffet breakfast, hotel so close to the Eurostar station. Even though our room was at the front of the hotel and by a very busy road the soundproofing was brilliant, slept really well the whole of our stay",positive

The location could not have been better.. with being situated on the main market square. The view from the roof terrace was amazing too and the decor throughout the place was classy and had a nice touch",positive

"In my room there was no wifi, although it worked in all the other rooms. Me and my roommates tried to ask the staff to fix it, but they didn't, so throughout all of my stay I had no wifi. I think the staff didn't put too much effort into solving our problem bc wifi worked in all the other rooms, and that attitude makes me sad. Also take your own lock (costs 4 euros at the reception) and towel, it's 3 euros to rent it.,

Nice rooms, big bathroom. There was a table in the room with plenty of chairs, which was nice. some places to put your clothes, even hangers. Breakfast was good, nothing special - cereal and toast, there was coffee, orange juice - enough to go through the morning.",negative

The location and design of home",negative
"The hotel was situated near the station but the area was very run down. I went with my daughter and as we walked around we felt vulnerable and at times unsafe. Just a few doors from the hotel is a sex shop and a sex show club.,

Check in was easy and because it was 37 degrees they gave us extra cold water. Room was lovely and spacious, very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful.",positive
"Elevator was not working, for which I complained and the issue got resolved by the staff.No internet in my room, previous time I stayed here, there was very fast internet in my room.Only 2 lockers in the room for 4 people.,

The breakfast was very good but can be improved.It was a male-only room and I am amazed how polite the guys were. That has never happened to me while I am/was staying in a mixed room.",negative

More than we expected!",positive

"I would prefer if shower room could be locked. Locker size in rooms is too small. The night reception is little unintuitively disguised as a bar.,

Good choice, they even had juices and sufficient choice of meals. My room was plenty spacious and even had its own wash sink with large mirror.",negative
"Nothing,

We really enjoyed our stay and will return. The restaurant is excellent and you have a choice of a full or more limited menu to suit your budget. The breakfast was brilliant. The room was light and airy and immaculate. Our dog was welcomed too.",positive

Friendly staff/ownersMuch room with a extra chamber with couch Good breakfeast",negative
Every night a lot of noise on the floor due to drunken people coming home from the city. That disturbed my sleep and resulted in me not being rested for my meetings the following day.,positive
"No tea / coffee making facility in the room only down in the communal kitchen.  No drawers or storage space only a hanging rail, although plenty of space in the room where a chest of drawers could have been put.Room untouched for our 4 day stay.,

Good sized room with lovely balcony and view over the lake. Owner was very helpful in giving us breakfast early on Sunday morning to allow us to go to the 11th November commemoration.Would be lovely stay in the summer.",negative
"The only thing that bothered me was a door key - sometimes I went to brush my teeth and couldn't get inside 'cause it wouldn't work :DD,

Hospitality was super warm and cheerful. This place is filled with the atmosphere of happy youth, beautiful people and laughter. If I ever get back, I'd prefer spend my nights here again!",positive

I get bad service and it's totally different from what I see in the west the camer and breakfast parking totally I am  not expecting like this I now Mercury in the hege Netherlands he is too really nice hotel but your hotel 🤭,negative
"Our room overlooked the courtyard, meaning it was extremely noisy at night and in the morning. We were also the room next door to the dining room which meant yet again that it was extremely noisy and busy outside our room early in the morning. Other than that the room and hostel in general was clean and the staff were friendly. The location was slightly poor. A good 20 min walk into the centre which wasnt fun in the wind and rain. Metro is easy to use so probably the best way to get about. Loved brussels though. Would visit again ,

Clean and friendly",negative

"It is much more run down than in the photos, it is very ""tired"" ,  worn carpets etc . Needs a lot of money spending in it . We were misled by the pictures they must be very old. Totally not value for money. We paid 95 Euros and it was no where near that standard. ,

Location very nice and it was quirky .",negative
They charged for minibar drinks those I did nit drink.,negative
Lovely location,positive
"For the double rooms situated in the building a few meters away from the hostel, it can get a bit noisy from the street, also the building has thin walls and you can hear children or noisy guests in the rooms next door,

Exceptionaly friendly staff (the girl at the reception especially! great spoken English and very very welcoming amd helpful), nice comfortable sheets, very good location and great bars and food close by, the street offers a local vibe in the morning which is very nice. On Sunday morning there is a street fair with music and people selling used items, it s very nice and lively!",positive

Very comfortable bed. Room in general.",positive
"Made 2 complaints about noise from a neighbouring room. Hotel staff did nothing about this, noise continued. Had a terrible nights sleep. Spoke to reception staff about this when checking out, they were completely disinterested with our comments and reluctantly gave an apology. Manager was ""not around"" to speak to. No compensation was offered. Awful stay.,

"According to the prices - administration are shameless people. This hotel was a 4star hotel maybe 5-10 years ago, but it does not deserve 4 stars as is now. It feels quiet old. Would never stay there again for this money and would not recommend to anyone else.,

Very helpfull and friendly staff.",negative
Great location and a great bar. Plenty of toilets and our dorm felt cosy and safe.,positive
"Everything you could want but some plant milk at breakfast and gluten free bread would be nice.,

If I am in Durbury, I always try to book a room at  Hotel La Caleche! It is centrally located, has rooms with all modern comforts, including ipad, huge shower and LED lighting.  Even though it's in the heart of Durbury, it's very quiet at night. They do a nice breakfast in the morning and the staff are very friendly. It's also excellent value for money.",positive

Very good hot showers n large shower stalls with hooks n places for clothes.....1 of the rare ones that did!!!",positive

The bar",positive
"If you are a Vegan, the breakfast is really limited (I don't think they even have plant based milk.)  There is bread and jams and some fruit, but not worth the 12Euros.,

The rooms were very interesting, with a very modern control system.",positive
"There are only one bathroom and toilet each floor and we can’t wash our hands in the toilet.... It’s not really a good idea...

"No reception ,

Close to the city center and cheap",positive

The bath!",positive
"The breakfast was not up to expectations. It could have been better. For example, there were no eggs, or tea. there was only one type of chees and bread. The cleanliness of the room was also not good. There was a lot of dust under the bed. Towels were not replaced regularly. You have to ask the management for new towels before going for shower.,

the location of the hotel was very nice. it was in a very peaceful surroundings. The Hotton city is just a 5 minutes drive from the hotel.",positive
"There was a small leak (kitchen tap) but it did not bother me for a short stay.,

The room was nice. It has a furnished kitchen and it is clean. It was quiet and the internet was fast and easily accessible. There is a table to work and it is well located.",positive

The luxury squeezed into such a small space; room had all necessary amenities; lovely bathroom. The quality of customer care was top-notch. The takeaway brekkie was a very thoughtful size.",positive

Nik the owner, just an amazing host. With these hard Corona times, we felt like he had everything assured, planned and was always on top of his game.
And a nice chap to chat with too.",positive
"very noisy, bring earplugs,

decent room, good location",positive
"The superiot room was overprized, for what is offered.
Breakfast was reduced to a pick nick bag with continental items, though paying full price. Everything in the bag was wrapped in plastic. So much waste!
We have stayed in other hotels during Covid, where breakfast was offered differently, but still full choice. A matter of management.
The staff is friendly, but lacking efficiency.
Also, for a Hotel in the middle of nature, most of the indoor plants were in plastic.
The clock in the room was not working.
Just an eye for detail missing, but charging a high rate, thats a pitty ,

Staff was very friendly.
Good location",negative
"Realy basic,

Close to the beach",positive

"Looks like the buildings could use some renovation. This is the second time something went wrong in my room. The upgrade I got, even though it was bigger, was not so comfortable. Could hear the neighbor talking late at night as if he was in my room. Wifi was very weak and unstable.,

Reasonable price. Small kitchen. Located within the city, 15min walking from the center. The host was kind to give me an upgrade after something went wrong in the room.",negative
"The room was cold, the thermostat did not do much for us.,

Good location, close to Bruxelles Midi Station and the Metro. Fantastic extra services like: spa and jakkuzi. Latest check out time as well (12:00) what I experienced so far. Cleaning everyday with fresh towels ans sheets.",positive
"Corona measures were good, food delivered to room on request",positive
"The view from the room is of the town.  Would have preferred a sea view, but I don't think any of the rooms have that.  There is a ferocious wind that comes off of the sea.  Maybe that is why.  I thought the check in time was a bit late at 4.30pm and the check out time a bit early 10am.,

The hotel room was excellent, in terms of being able to 'look after yourself'.  It had a kitchen with everything you needed, including plates, cups and cutlery.  Staff were friendly and we got free parking on the grounds. The beds fold up into the wardrobe to make room during the day.  My partner and I slept really well.   The breakfast was fine.  Continental buffet.  Only there one night, so didn't use any of the other facilities.",positive
"We did like everything. You feel like home just with an extra comfort. Perfectly suitable both you go with family or with friends. We stayed in ""africa suite"" and loved so much the style of that. Very unique design B&B. ..and thank you again for the welcome chocolates ;)",positive

ok kitchen, enough space for two persons, central location in leuven",negative
"Located in a bit shady area if you go outside in the night,

Facilities, staff, flexibility to bring children",positive
"Its a pity that Superior rooms have no options for double bed. They have twin beds with separate loosely fixed mattresses, so they were moving during the night. A bit annoying to find out you are sleeping in the hole between mattresses. Also blankets were too small in width, so you cannot really cover yourself properly. We asked for big double blanket but it was not provided :(
Some surfaces were a bit dusty and shower missed a small shelve for soaps.,

Staff was nice and pleasant. They delivered quite nice food into the room, which is nice from their side during corona time. Superior room was in general quite spacious, cosy and nicely decorated with a touch of modern design. I really liked lights which created warm atmosphere in the room. Kitchen had everything needed for proper cooking. Besides multifunctional oven, electric cooker, pans and pots, there was a fridge which is not mentioned on booking.com. Restaurant area was also nicely decorated but we had no chance 5o ty it due to corona. All in all, we enjoyed our stat despite small drawbacks. Thanks!",positive
"The restaurant: people not kind and not helpful. Constantly closed much before indicated in the menu. Pool closing 20 minutes before indicated.,

Very close to the beach and center. Playground ok camera ok. But in general expensive",negative
Absolute beautiful and relaxing guesthouse. Had everything I could possibly think of. Highly recommended. Thank you very much for my stay. I will be staying with you next time for sure.,positive
"Friendly staff, good, fresh breakfast, silent neighbourhood- perfect for recover an relax after long day.",positive
"There were not lift.  The switch in the bathroom is inside the bathroom cabinet. The shower floor is too high with respect to the bathroom floor. The lights in the room are not well distributed, therfore it is difficult to distinguish details in some places like the wardrobe.,

The room space and the furniture are OK. The beds are nice. There are kitchen menage, TV set, couch, lamp, heating, bedclothes and towels. All of them are OK.",positive
Everything was fine!,positive
"The appartment is in need a some (very) minor repairs, which didn't bother us much. We had to clean kitchen-ware before use, as previous visitors hadn't kept them clean enough, but it was no big deal. The appartment has a dishwasher and tablets were provided.,

Location and views are amazing. Very spacious and clean. We would love to come back. Easy parking for the bikes just outside the appartment. Free public parking for the car is 300m away. We could temporarily use the fee-paying parking right next to the apparment to get our suitcases.",positive
"The room is on the first floor and its windows face the street. The sound from the pub below gets muffled into the room, so I would say that's not a big deal (at least not for me), but you might hear voices from people on the street leaving the pub.,

Good location: in the old town. Though, you have to cross the town to get to the train station.The room is very spacious. Every bed has a lamp and sockets to charge the phone. There are big lockers and a couple if chairs. The bathroom was next to the room, which also has a washbasin. On the ground floor there is a very nice pub to meet people, basically lots of beers and alcohol, it also offers pizzas. There is a supermarket nearby. The staff is very friendly.",positive
"The hotel is located in an area I could easly name “Little Maghreb”. I don’t want to make any further comments :),

The room was very spacious. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful.",positive
"Bathroom is rather small but ok for a short stay.,

We went on bike weekend and this hotel has great facilities for safe storage of the bike and the possibility to charge the battery of your e-bike in this storage room.",positive
"It is getting run down.  The hotel rooms all face a gas station and the city.  The other side of the building, where there are no rooms, face the ocean.  Don’t be fooled when you reserve a room with a view.  THERE ARE NO ROOMS WITH AN OCEAN VIEW!,

The location is decent...not great.",negative
Everything it’s amazing. I’m in love!,positive

Excellent location and facilities.,positive
"Cold water shower in the morning, baby crying at night.,

'Castle' feeling, beautiful garden worth a small walk, agreed to serve breakfast earlyer.,",negative
"The fact that the bathroom was far from the room as well as the fact that there is no soap or some handtowels in the bathroom. I had soap in my room but I really believe there should be basic soap for handwashing. I had a private room so I was expecting more.,

The staff was really nice and helpful. I've missed breakfast as it is only until 10 AM which in my opinion should be changed but the person at the reception recommended me a few good places where to have breakfast. The one I chose from the list was AMAZING! 24/7 reception was the main reason I booked this place. Location is not that good but not bad either. Bruges is a small town so everything is close.",positive
"The hotel is really old. Shower, towels, furniture are pretty used out. The soap smells bad. 
The location is not far from hikes,  but it's very noisy from all the cars passing by, even at night. The air is hot and dry, no air conditioning, nor air ventilation in the bathroom.
No double beds in the whole hotel. 
Safety box is in the room, but it's not attached to the wardrobe, so you basically can take it and leave the room.
Generally, too expensive for that level of quality ,

The food (dinner) is good quality. The staff is really friendly. There is a parking lot just in front of the hotel",negative
"Carpet was old and stained.,

Great breakfast choices!",positive

Nice personnelbreakfast - egg of choice!",negative
Loved it friendly staff good size room for 2,positive

Or maybe just the fact we wished to have more time spent there than we had....,

Close to the airport
Charming
Beautifully decorated 
Cozy and spacious enough with the big garden.
Decent place to eat and until late a short walking distance away
Facilities and a variety of bears if you want to.
Host were very welcoming and cooperative.
Suited our needs 100%.",positive
"I was welcomed very, very friendly, and the room was comfortable I could rest well.I had a good breakfast, this is a good start for a working day.",positive
"Rooms should be much cleaner. It looks like nobody cares about cleaning thoroughly the apartments after each stay. Beds and facilities are ok. Dirty floors.,

The service is well organized and quick to complete.The rooms have minimal but working facilities.Location is okay considering the size of Leuven.",negative
"Referring to the above... we stayed in a apartment so there weren't any staff.
There was nothing we didn't like.
The only thing we found was when using the oven or hob it was very dark in that area.,

The apartment was excellent for our stay. Well thought out. Would definitely stay there again.",positive
Location and attention to details,positive
"The weather was incredible hot during those days therefore the apartment was really hot. AC is there but not working properly. It was like a sauna.,

Location, place very charming. Clean and very well equiped.",positive
"We booked a suite but The room was awful. The carpet was full of stains and it was stinking. I am allergic to dust, so you can imagine how bad it was for me. The furniture in the room was very old fashioned and cheap. The only thing nice about the room was the view on the park. Advice to hotel Management: please renovate the rooms ! You have an amazing location, but it is a pity if people have great expectations and then the rooms are blowing everything off. Also, the breakfast was poor and with low quality food. 
The staff was non-existent. We only saw a couple of people in the breakfast room, but for the rest the reception was always empty. ,

The location is amazing. The historical palace and the park are just great. Just 10 minutes by car from Bruges city centre.",negative
"Old bathroom facilities. Shower was terrible, had to hold button in entire time to get water to work. No soap. Toilets had no basin to wash hands, sanitiser provided instead. No kitchen, hot water only provided. Had to pay extra for breakfast however it was worth 4 euros.,

Large female only room. Nice cosy downstairs shared dining area. Good breakfast (pay extra). Close to old town.",positive
Services perfect,positive
"Carpets in general are always outdated and unhygenic, but this one was covered in unknown stains, all across the room. Reading other people's reviews I realised I was not the only one encountering this. I have never seen something like this in Holland. This is unacceptable for a (4-star) hotel. (see photo)While walking around outside its easy to forget that you're actually in Europe; the hotel is close to a train station; at night there are a lot of drug addicts, homeless and gipsies on the streets, sleeping outside or talking to you if you walk by. They come in big numbers. If you travel by car, especially one having a ''foreign'' license plate, it is highly advised to park it in the hotel garage. This costs you €25. Group of men hang around the parked cars outside, I witnessed one urinating against one. I personally wouldn't go out alone at night as a woman or with children. Be aware of pickpockets too.,

Rooms were very quiet, unlike many others hotels in Brussels. Reception staff spoke Dutch like they're supposed to.Overall, I've learnt that booking a hotel is always quite a gamble in Belgium, even at 4-5 star hotels, the quality standard is lower. However this one was decent enough.",negative

So second day you cannot use it. Strategic but no nice.Bistrot/restaurant so and so Breakfast is average or below but included in the price,

Pool but not the changing room (small cabins)",negative
Comfort,positive
"Overal OK, but don't expect much. 
Have you ever seen a check-in Tim set at 16 o'clock? For me this is the first time. With quite an early checkout at 10. I guess cleaning a room takes 6 hours? 
Check-in and checkout times left me 2 of three days on the street. Despite having requested somewhat later check-in and somewhat earlier checkout while booking, they said they would try. However, on the ground, employees just don't do any effort to be helpful except from apllying their unnecessarily strict rules.",negative
"There was nothing to dislike.,

We have just enjoyed the most magical stay in Bonifacius. We were greeted on arrival by Lynn and she was so welcoming. She immediately offered us secure parking for our car, and once that was sorted we were treated to champagne as Lynn welcomed us and explained everything we needed to know. We had a beautiful room overlooking the canal and Our Lady's Church and Bonifacius Bridge. Again the best words that come to mind is just magical.
The room decor is beautiful and so in keeping with the medieval house. The bathroom offered comfort and luxury with all Hermes products.
Lynn looking after us so well and served us a beautiful breakfast each morning. She also helped us sort out food options for the evening as the restaurants were closed. 
My Fiance  is so in love with B&B Bonifacius we are booking in again for next Christmas.
Brugge is a very special place to visit and B&B Bonifacius to us the perfect place to stay and explore this medieval town. 
Thanks for making our stay so special Lynn and going out of your way to accommodate everything we needed.

We didn't get a key but a code for entering the appartement much better then keys because you'll never forget them.,positive
"Room did not have a window.  You have 2 doors, one giving on the hall and one giving outside.  I alsways leave my window open to sleep, so was feeling a little bit oppressed.  But otherwise, the room had all you need.,

People were very very nice.  Food was nice in the evening, Breakfast was well served.  And I liked the little questionnaire of what you wanted for breakfast to make sure you have enough and you eat all you have requested.",positive

Beautiful beautiful garden, great place for photos. Free parking on site. Spacious room.",positive
The personnel treated me very good. Gave me all the information I needed. The room was nice and clean. Comfy beds and the bathrooms were clean. Breakfast was good too. It’s close to the center like a 10 or 15 minute walk and there’s a bus from the train station that leaves you 3 minutes away from the hostel so you don’t have to walk that much.,positive
Breakfast,positive
"-The staff barely spoke English, they just kept talking French while I don’t speak French. Because of that, there were a lot of mistakes maken and miscommunication.
-The WIFI/signal was very very bad. The signal on the small TV aswell. We were not able to watch TV.
-The roomservice was disgusting. A lot of food on the menu wasn’t available. We ordered a pizza, and it was all burnt. We tried it another time, but it  was like a dry frozen pizza from the shop.
-The hotel keeps the doors closed. So we couldn’t come in, you have to ring a bell every time you want to come in and go out. When you arrive for first time it’s not told so it’s very uncomfortable. Sometimes, no one is at the reception. So they just let you keep waiting outside. This was very frustrating.
-They say they have a 24-hour reception, but unfortunately that’s not true.. We called reception multiple times around 1:00 in the night and no one picked up. They woke us up by calling us back in the morning why we were asleep ..
-Shower made a very hard and strange noise.
-Rooms were very noisy. There was a party with balloons in the room next to us and we heard everything. 
-At last communication was very bad. When ordering roomservice they don’t understand English, they say they will call you back 3 times while they don’t, and last but not least; you have to pick it up yourself at the bar downstairs...

The location was excellent right near the train station and 10 minutes from the beach. The breakfast was good and the staff was kind and attentive.

"We weren't given the code for the gate where you actually enter the ""Terrasses de Malmedy"" area but only a code for the key box to the house. Luckily other people were right there to help out. But make sure your host gives you two codes. One for the gate and one for the key box to the house.,

The place nice and clean. We were unlucky with the weather, the drive way was completely flooded due to heavy rain.",positive
"It’s hard to find any negatives here.,

We were welcomed with open arms by hostess Sophie. She had a friendly and caring attitude. She took the time to explain things well and was really helpful with pointing us toward nice activities nearby.The whole B&B was beautiful, cosy and impeccably clean. We stayed in the Oslo room. It looked utterly amazing. A lot of attention to detail. Breakfast was included in our rate, and it was superb! Fresh fruit, and a lot of food choice, freshly ground coffee, glass of fresh orange juice. All with an personal touch.Apple TV with Netflix and other services included. But we hardly used it.",positive

Nice park next to the hotel. There is a nice jogging path along the river. But most of all, try the restaurant of this hotel. Extremely good seafood dishes, good service, nice wine and champagne. Very professional. They offered gluten free bread to me for dinner and breakfast and even offered us a coffee at 6am when the breakfast room was still closed.",positive

"The location is not the best if you are looking for alot to do but it is good enough for a relaxing getaway.,

We have a lovely stay. Owner from the place was really friendly. Breakfast was served with a great selections of cheese and cold cuts. The idea of having apple TV in the room was just fantastic! It was a pity that we couldn't make it to a nice restaurant nearby as it was full. There are quite a few nice restaurants in the neighbourhood within 10-20mins driving distance but make sure you make a booking in advance.",positive

A recommendation from us for all who wants to have a stay near Brussels.
You should book incl. breakfast as this was so great. Rooms are clean and decorated with love and pleasure.

We booked just for one night to stop before travelling further.
Joris and his wife were so kind and did everything for us to feel comfortable.

It was okay. They had tea and coffee and a kettle in the room and the shower was good. The bar area looked nice and the curtains were good at blocking out the light.",negative

It was very trendy, very friendly staff",positive
"Amazing hosts, brilliant decor throughout the main house and the suites, fabulous breakfast.",positive
"The sink in the kitchen was clogged, same for the shower (to a lesser extent). The shower wall was old and could be cleaned better. The worst was the fire alarm that was beeping every 2 minutes when I arrived (batteries were dead). So I had to take it off to be able to sleep. There was no hair dryer nor the iron in the apartment.,

Leuven is a small town, so everything is easily reachable. What I liked is the fact that amazing biological zero waste shop called ""Content"" was just around the corner and in front of it there was an artisanal bakery. Really amazing combination just next door.",negative
"Parking could be a problem - we always found a space close to the hotel but there is no reserved parking.,

Freshly renovated Hotel with only a few rooms lead by the owner. You can feel that everything is done with love in this property.Room: Size was OK and equipped with nice design furniture. I felt the bed being to soft but thats individual.Location: 5 minutes to reach the the seasideBreakfast: Remarkable variety of high quality foods! Great !The hotel is not cheap but we definitely judged it worth the money.",positive
"The only very slight drawback to our accommodation was that, because of the age of the building, some noise could be heard from other guests in the hallway and downstairs in the mornings. However, it wasn't a problem and didn't disturb us too much, as the guesthouse hasn't many guests at any one time and all were very considerate anyway.,

Breakfast was excellent, with a beautifully set table overlooking the canal, fresh fruit, freshly squeezed orange juice, locally made chocolates and continental breakfast on the table already. There was also the option of a cooked breakfast 'hash' and even a complimentary glass of champagne. A great start to each day. The host was very friendly and helpful and recommended various places to eat and drink. Our room was spacious, pretty and comfortable.

The pillows wer too soft and even with 2 was not enough to hold your head correctly.
Parking a bit small for a full hotel, almost didn’t have a place left.,

Spacious rooms very nicely decorated. Shower is good and beds are comfy. The common areas and restaurant were also trendy done, with 2 outdoor areas to sit and have a drink.
Breakfast was very good with enough choice for every taste.",positive
"Very welcoming host. Charming B&B with a beautiful garden, which we could access from our terrace. Our room, the Barn, also disposed of a small yet fully equipped kitchenette. The airco was also a nice to have given the outside temperatures when we were there! All in all, we immediately felt welcome, had a great stay and are looking forward to be back.",positive

The guy told me that Booking.com is charging them for the service and I had to pay for the breakfast. It was not a big deal E4 and the breakfast was plenty and delicious.,

I was pleasantly surprised how comfy the bed was. The place was clean and the members of the staff were helpful.",positive
"I actually drove right past the hotel at first: it could be signposted better.I'd also like to have some tea in the room, and perhaps a small fridge.,

"Was the most beautiful place we ever were! Since the 1st minute we knocked to the door and Lyne showed up it was an amazing experience. She was so sweet when welcoming us, she had ready for us a table with Champagne and chocolates! She explained us everything to do and visit. The house is like a fairytale, feeling like a princess in those beautiful bedrooms. Breakfast is amazing, especially having it with the most beautiful view in all town. The location is perfect, 5-10 min from everywhere. Everything is easy with the hostess, she is really involve with the guess and helpful. We highly recommended this place, there is not place better than Bonifacius, if you want to have an amazing experience this is definitely the best place to stay in Bruges  . Can’t wait to come back.

"Den Engel is located in a small hamlet not far from Zaventem airport. The hamlet has a bank and a decent sized supermarket.  The accommodation was very good and the lady in charge was well organised.   Our accommodation was in what appeared to be a stables block of a 120 year old house. The kitchen, bathroom and lounge were on the ground floor and the bedroom and another toilet on the upper mezzanine floor. Upstairs was reached via a spiral staircase.The Internet worked OK and there were lots of channels on the TV.Depending on which way the wind is blowing you will hear aircraft if you sit in the garden.  But the apartment walls are very thick and you could not hear anything once inside.",positive
"Would have liked a broom to be able to sweep the floor. The cleaning of the place could have been more detailed eg wipe bins over, wipe the back wall in the kitchen, clean the glass doors in the shower. The power point in the bedroom is loose, toilet roll holder kept falling apart. It would have been better with a block out curtain in the bedroom. Construction work and busy people in the street before 6am not that Condo Gardens can do anything about this.  Not bad for the price though.,

There was a good amount of space. The kitchen was good. When we only had 1 fork and no teatowel in the kitchen the problem was solved quickly. Shop within walking distances. Nice walk down to restaurants and bars. Lots of choice and good food. Parking is available. Parking on the street is free from 9 pm to 9 am.",positive
"Nothing,

This is a small boutique hotel which gives a feeling more of a B2B, which I found positive. Saying that, you are not just a number. The owner is so dynamic and communicative, she finds time to spend with each and every guest, to pay attention on the details and make your stay unforgettable. At the arrival I got a rose, fruit in the room and welcome drink, cava or other. Next day we had home made cookies in the room. In the room at your disposal Nespresso coffee and bio tea. Also tea and coffee in the lobby are included in the room rate.Breakfast - is really amazing!!! The variety of bread, jams and hams. at your equest she prepares omelette or any other type of egg and pancakes. I fell in love with her home made bread with nuts and feagues. Cava, fresh orange juice, hot drinks are also served at the breakfast.This is a nice experience, not just an overnighting in an hotel. You won't regret it. I will definitely go back and will recommend everybody!",positive

We were in Leuven for Werchter Boutique festival and this was the perfect place to stay for the one day festival. It’s 15 mins walk from the train station and 10 mins walk from the old town. The split level apartment gives plenty of space for the stay, including a small kitchen area for self-catering.Condo Gardens Leuven was a great base for our trip.",positive

The place is lovely, really comfortable.",positive
"Although the hotel is good for what you pay, the service for the dinner at night just made our stay unpleasant. We made a reservation in advance. When arriving to the restaurant we were waiting to get seated with another couple. A waiter came to seat the first couple and then started taking orders at other tables, we waited 10 minutes more to be seated. We ordered drinks and wanted to order food immediately but got told we needed to wait 5 minutes, it took 20 minutes to get another waiter to finally take our food order. After we ordered, our own waiter came to ask our order another 15 minutes later. Halfway our dinner we wanted another drink, which we had to cancel after 20 minutes waiting and in the meantime finishing our food already. When we mentioned it they tried to make us not cancel the drink because ""they were just working on it"", we had to insist to cancel the drink.,

Lovely location 
and a very lovely garden at rear",positive
We loved the great atmosphere of this beautifully furnished historic building and the fantastic rural landscape just in walking distance. There is also plenty of cultural things to do within about half an hour driving distance. The kind landlords have prepared a selection of maps and information about hiking routes and interesting sites.,positive
"Everything was perfectly organized ,

Great house, great location and great host.",positive
"Parking was advertised as ""secure"" on booking.com, but when we got to the hotel it was on street parking. luckily we were able to remove everything from the car, but secure parking was one of the things I looked for when booking the hotel.,

The hotel was beautiful, only a few minutes walk from the beach and the centre of town.  The breakfast was superb, and the freshly squeezed orange juice delicious! the staff were very friendly and helpful.",positive

"Room was at the front no traffic noise when window shut but our room was just as you cane up the stairs and was woke a few times from noisy people. The other thing there was no kettle or tea and coffee in the room and you know us English like a cup of tea. Would still stay here again but nit at top of stairs. ,

A beautiful hotel so close to main town and carpark. Room was really nice but floor creaked a bit but what can you expect with an older building. Staff ok a good morning and a welcome would be nice as never stated in the area before. Breakfast was delicious the fresh bread and Brie outstanding.",positive
"N/a,

Everything",positive
"Nothing that I can think of. If I really had to pick something, it would be the lack of shampoo/shower gel holder in the shower, but that's really nitpicking.,

Everything you could possibly need was there. The kitchen was well equipped with a huge refrigerator, a coffee maker, bread toaster, dish washer, and so on. We had plenty of space and never felt cramped. We stayed with 4 adults and a dog and really had room to spare. The double bathroom is very nice as well if you go with 2 couples. The location is about 15 min by foot from the town center. We never had any noise issues from traffic or anything. Im usually not much of a ""stay at the accommodation"" kind of guy but I could relax there for days on end if I had to :).",positive
"Close to town,

Nothing stands out. The room is a very tired students residential type squat. Bed was basic and very uncomfortable.",negative
"The hotel is located in a street that leads (cars) towards the center of Blankenberge, which means that there is quite a number of cars passing in front of the hotel during the day but also in the evening.Even though the hotel was being very pet friendly, Blankenberge somehow isn't. In a radius of 500 meters, there was only one tiny little green spot (around 20 m2 probably?) where dogs could do their job. This obviously has nothing to do with the hotel, but I feel like having to share it with other pet owners.Wat we also didn't like was the ""quietness"" of our room. I explicitly asked for a quite room because me and my wife have a very light sleep. Unfortunately we got a room on the 1rst floor, so we had rooms all around us except below us (Breakfast room and reception were below us). From the moment we arrived in our room the first day (around 14h00) until 03h00 at night (!!!) There were people above us moving things around, and heavily and PERMANENTLY walking up and down the room barefoot, working out for a marathon or something...!? (I am being sarcastic about the marathon of course) We didn't manage to rest a single minute after our long journey and neither did we get to sleep the first night. (The next 2 nights were perfectly fine though)Last, but not least, must we admit that one of the staff members were quite harsh to their guests mainly during breakfast. There was for example one other couple from Luxembourg and a German couple that really were not happy with the way that staff member talked to them and treated them, but the staff remained uninterested. Even though we did not have a negative experience, we found it quite disturbing to watch and hear this.,

The location of the Hotel was perfect, a short 10 minute walk to the beach and the town center made it very easy to enjoy the good weather. Also the room was very spacious, modern, clean, comfortable and in our case very pet friendly! Parking spaces are available at a nearby car park or in the streets around the hotel, both at cost though.Finally, the breakfast really was outstanding, I am keen to say that it might have been the best breakfast I have ever had in 30 years!",positive

"It was one of the worst mattresses I've ever ""tried"" to sleep on.  It had zero support, my back ached the next day from the terrible mattress.  Also there was no fitted sheet for the mattress.  Five flights of very narrow stairs, no parking, had to park in a not too far away (6-minute walk) car park, 16 euro for 24 hours.,

The location was EXCELLENT!  Only a 5 minute walk from the Castle and several additional sights to see.  Had a great view of one of the main busy streets, beautiful!  The WIFI was really good too, and Dena was very helpful and gave great dinner suggestions.",positive

Aaandddd...don't have a recepcion, but have a BELL. Very very noisy bell. I was in the first level but every night I woke up when somebody came to the hotel, cause they pushed the Bell. I stay just one night, so this was not a big problem, but if i stay more in this hotel, so that would be very confusing.,

My view was to the garden. This was very nice. Breakfast is correct, but lots of morning about a little bit bored.
The hotel is nice and old. Have got a special vízbe",positive
"There is a construction work on the back of the house. If workers would have been at the site, they had a direct unhindered view into shower and bath room. Currently that would stop me from going back. Previous habitant had left coffee remains in coffee machine and it was growing bit fungi. Owner said the substitute cleaner was doing bad job and it may well be so. Microwave was missing. The place could use a day or two of ""mans hand"" to fix some minor things. The name on the door was not ""La Ducale Appart"" but ""3C Appartments"". Caused some unnecessary confusion.,

Location is very good, some hundred meters to the centre. There are some restaurants and a food store nearby, and one reaches everything on foot. Design is modern and adequate. It is really nice when the appartment has sheets and towels and tourist maps included. Basic utensils that one expects are there. Owner tried to fix few cleaning/maintenance problems, she herself noticed at arrival. I had no time to notice or comment most things myself.",positive

"Nothing really hence excellent scoring. Only quibble was the king-size bed was oddly provided with two single duvets under a counter pane rather than a large king-sized duvet. Both duvets were poorly filled. ,

Fabulous location right in the centre on a canal yet very quiet at night. Exceptional personal service from the owner Lynne. Atmospheric historical setting, accommodation and a fine breakfast that would be hard to beat in any larger hotel. If you like staying in something more genuine than a regular hotel (of which there are many fine examples in Bruges), this guesthouse should be on your list for consideration.",positive
"The bar closed early 7pm and there was not a restaurant on site for dinner,

The room was huge.  Two queen beds and a large renovated washroom.  the grounds were vast with a nice sitting areas out back and a fountain with some walking trails.  A unique location that was a pleasure to stay in",positive

"The apartment smelled horribly (mold/mildew)- despite airing it out every day, the smell was so strong that  it stuck to all my clothes when I left. It was the dirtiest place I have ever stayed- I’m attaching a picture of the dirty/ceiling isolation stalactites because I’m not even sure what they are. The right one also had spiderwebs on it so they appear stagnant at least. The window curtains have weird red stains on them as well. The place is badly isolated- you can hear all your neighbors clearly and the courtyard very clearly- and the place is in a sketchy area (next to the city jail) so you hear a lot of sirens at a lot of times. Heating requires plugging in the electric heater- sockets are falling apart, see other reviews- and smells like something is burning (probably just dirt). Things got worse a few days in when the bathroom started strongly smelling like sewer, I complained to reception but they said the handyman had left and wouldn’t come back until the next day. The smell crept into the rest of the apartment, it was nauseating and made me dizzy. I ended up leaving a day early because I couldn’t take it anymore. If you’re considering staying here because (like me) you’re young and broke, consider staying in Brussels instead and commuting in by train. Seriously, don’t do this to yourself.,

Well, leaving this place was a huge relief.",negative
Everything was fantastic. The level of finish and attention to detail was amazing. The best Hotel I have stayed in for a very long time and I stay in a lot!,positive
"The only piece of negative feedback we had was that it was a little noisy at night. The AC rattled when running, but it was too hot not to run the AC (this kept us up) and the walls are quite thin, so we were woken up by a guest arriving next door.,

Lin was the best host. We were blown away by her attentiveness and kindness. She was so helpful from the point of arrival through our departure. Breakfast was delicious, the location was fabulous and we felt very comfortable and safe. The hospitality was the highlight. Lin and her staff were absolutely wonderful!",positive

The apartment was clean and comfortable. There were also some basic things like coffee, salt, pepper and little dishwashing liquid.

"This is a lot of text here but in general it's minorities. There was a free tea/coffee in the room, but only two glasses for it (not sure how they applicable for tea), without even spoons, you need to request them additionally which is not so great. Also, the air conditioning system seems not so strong, had to open a window which produces noise.,

Room and view are great, we had free water, tea and coffee, There is also a minibar available (without fridge). Nothing verbose to said - everything is great",positive

Breakfast is from 8 to 10. At 9:30 they were no eggs nor bacon available. We waited a little bit and ask for more (after looking for the lady for 5 minutes). Then they said the kitchen is closed now.

The front door as well as the main door of the building were opened the whole night, so anyone from the street could easy come into the place. Many noises during the night coming from outside and other rooms, besides the annoying hum of the refrigerator. Furthermore, no refund was possible. I would not recommend it.,

"I had an incident with a man who wasn’t a guest walking through the hotel that knocked on my room door at 10 pm and was following after me. Building gates are open at all times, even during the night which makes it very unsafe. The receptionist named Jasmain called the police who came and interrogated the man. I have an Australian number so I couldn’t do it myself. But then, when I requested to move to a different room as the man knew exactly which one was my room number and where was located, the receptionist very rudely  denied saying that she was tired, she had a long day and she was hungry cause she didn’t eat anything in 24 hours. She said the hotel was fully booked which is not true, as I tried to make a new reservation and the option was still available. She also suggested for me to sleep in a mattress on my father bedroom which was one level up. But she said the housekeepers wasn’t there so I needed to it myself. When I told her if she could help me she denied and then when I requested for her to call the manager, she said she was the manager (only after 2 hours she identified herself as the manager) and she started screaming at me very loud and rude, even coursing me “god damn you” and then she left leaving me alone at midgnight terrified as the man following me could come back any moment as he wasn’t a guest, but the gates of the hotel were open widely. Easy access to my room and the whole hotel at any time by any person from the street. Extremely unsafe. I was terrified, so my father moved the mattress to his room and I slept in the floor. I paid for a room that I couldn’t use. Never been so mistreated in my life. Never been so terrified. The manager jasmien was rude and careless. Morning after, I heard another female guest complaining that her lock didn’t work so the door was open at all times.I repeat, extremely UNSAFE!! I wouldn’t recommend any travellers to stay at this place, specially women.",negative

"Besides the beach, there is absolutely nothing around the hotel, not one shop, not one restaurant.   If you do not drive, you must take the tramway to the City Centre to find them.  The hotel restaurants themselves are cafeterias, big rooms with no atmosphere.  The wifi is inconsistent, and one of our rooms had zero connectivity, either wifi or 3-4G.  Also, it would be nice to have an electric kettle in the rooms to boil water for tea or coffee.,

The rooms are nice and very spacious, the bathroom and the beds are good, there is ample space to organise clothes.  The hotel is located right in front of the beach and a tram stop, the Reception sells tram cards as tickets cannot be purchased onboard.",positive
"Unfair price. Small rooms. Spa is in the other building, not that easy to reach it.
Guests can get the bathrobe and slippers only after calling the receptionist. Seriously? You demand +100$ per night! Was it hard to offer during the check in?
Also, we found out about free spa literally occasionally. Aren't stuff supposed to inform about this?!
The only thing I've heard was rumors about coronavirus and Chinese guests.
Talking about spa. It's not really free. You can use it without payment just one time. Disappointing.

"Nothing. Everything was perfect. ,

Top of the range accommodation. Lovely hosts. Great breakfast. Very peaceful location.",positive
"The fact that the wall sockets were half hanging out of the walls. I needed to plug in my laptop and needed to get an extension. I forgot to ask if there was wifi and there was nothing in the flat to say what the code was. As I arrived late and there were roadworks I couldn't use the parking space allotted and although the concierge was helpful in telling me I needed to feed the meter where I was parked I could have done without that. Sadly his directions on how to get to the parking space I couldn't understand.,

I was only there for a very short night, arrived late and left very early. The bed was clean and very comfy and not too warm, I prefer it cool. Didn't use any of the facilities.",positive
"Nothing,

Lovely garden",positive
"We found some cloths from previous travelers on the mattress and under the blanket, and when complained that probably the sheets are not changed, they didn't care and just said we write it down to tell the house keepers to be more careful!!!!
The coffee line was too long, I waited for 45 minutes to get my breakfast coffee. I know it was because of corona, but it could be easily served by personnel table to table and not as a station with waiting line!!! ,

Easy to find, available parking places. Weekend breakfast starts at 7, many choices. Nice, clean and comfortable room. Pet friendly with additional cost.",positive
all the best,positive
"The property is far. Thank god we had a car. Restaurant is open for less then 2 hours. Rooms are very crappy. Rooms verry hot in the summer. Airconditioning does not work at night. They are shutdown on purpose to save electricity. I would not be going back.,

Nothing",negative
"The Place was very clean although the linen and decor may not be to everyone's taste. Our weekend stay included Saturday which during the night was a bit noisy, this may put some people off, however this didn't spoil our trip.,

We loved the close proximity of the appartments to Antwerp Central station. We asked for an early check-in, the host obliged willingly. Idris our host was fantastic during our stay, thank You for a pleasant stay",positive
"The parking is not included with the hotel and is an additional expense of 20euro per night (which adds up if you're staying for several nights).,

Hotel was conveniently located to restaurants and shops. Easy access to parking (however, not included with hotel stay). Clean and comfortable rooms. Very friendly and helpful staff.",positive
"For us It was ideal,

The whole experience was superb. Beau and Alin were welcoming, friendly and really helpful - a real pleasure to talk too. The location is beautiful and the room was spacious and the bed was comfy. I loved the special touches on the bed and the sweets!  We.would definitely go back. Highly recommended",positive
"Apartments a bit old, waited more than 30min to checkin",negative
This was a great value for the money. It was considerably less expensive than staying in historic Bruges and had free parking. You definitely need a car to go to the historic center - but the cost of parking was nothing compared to the cost savings.  Breakfast was traditional continental and there is a lot of room to sit outside and enjoy (good for kids who need to burn off energy!),positive
Close to beach and very quiet,positive
Led lights above bed are not possible to switch of at all,negative
"Great hotel, good location. Always chose this hotel, when travel to Minsk.",positive
"Old towels and bedding, very uncomfortable beds, the bunk beds for the children were not safe - thankfully the room had an extra bed, so that the children did not had to use the bunk bed. Too expensive for what is offered!,

Very nice for a family stay. The host was very helpful and accommodating even when he struggles to speak English.",positive
It is wery well,positive

"The drain in the bathroom sink and shower barley drained. I don’t like showering in a pool of water. There were cobwebs and mold in the bathroom.  There was a lot of dust behind the room  door and the main staircase was full of dirt. It looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed in a while.. The place is in need of an overhaul. There were only 2 pillows on the bed and my husband needs two. Couldn’t find anyone to give us another. There wasn’t one in the closet. Would only give it 3 stars.,

The outside of the building was beautiful.",negative
"Chake in 16:00,

Almost all i like !",positive

I was travelling to enjoy but I missed 3 days without swimming pool ,

The location is good if you want to walk up to city downtown.",positive
"The restaurant decoration is rather boring, canteen style. The location is not ideal for visiting, fine for business trip, but maybe not for tourism.,

Comfortable bed and room, decent breakfast with a substantial buffet, efficient staff. Wellness facilities (although I did not use them for lack of time). Good wifi.",positive

"Very nice hotel and clean,close to the center of the city,Leuven is nice city!!",positive
"What I realise now is that this ""hotel"" is mostly a daytime venue, with rooms available. I hadn't fully realised that when booking.There are very few facilities on site. No clearly obvious reception, and after 6pm its not manned.Restaurant/Bar was closed in the evening we stayed.No tea and coffee facilities available in room.We returned after a day out in Bruges at around 9pm, to find the accommodation in total darkness which we found very unnerving. We were clearly one of only a few occupied rooms that evening, a really disconcerting overnight stay.Couldn't comment on the available breakfast as we did not have it.",negative
"The staying from 16.00 till 9.30 is not really 24 hours right ? As it has to be. The automats with sweets and water do take money BUT DONT give the bought products back. In the room was no fulfilled mini bar, like .. why? There were no sleepers and robes, no glasses in the room For this price - (it’s really high price) we were not satisfied",negative
"Slow check in at reception.,

Nice location. Close to “Corona” trade center.
Great city view at night.
Very good breakfast.",positive
late check out! Thank you!,positive
"not much to dislike, unfortunately we arrived at 19.50hrs to be told the on site restaurant closed at 20.00hrs so we were too late, which was sad, and we thought a little early to close, but there were alternatives close by.,

When we arrived we were tired, so it was really nice to be welcomed with a happy receptionist, who was very helpful and knew what she was talking about, the room was nice and roomy, both clean and comfortable, we wouldn't hesitate to stay again if in the area.",positive
"It wasn't kids safe. Furniture seemed flimsy, and plugging in teapot shut off the power circuit in the entire apartment. We never received a replacement pot and there were no pots to boil water in. Also, we were afraid to plug in anything into power outlets after that.,

Location was great - it was very close to the shopping area and central station (a little far from sightseeing - about 25 minute walk). Host was responsive, even though he didn't speak English.",negative
Great location and very comfortable hotel. Staff lovely and very helpful. Very clean and comfortable,positive
The heater is not be operated. The water pipe in toilet doesn't drain. We try to contact staff but they didn't pick up the call.,negative
"Room was poorly maintained with some electrical wiring terminated using tape and left hanging, carpet had seen better days and it appeared one of those days involved significant fluid loss.  The furniture in the room and around the hotel was great and i would applaud loudly if i felt they were really going for a shabby chic look, the shabby unfortunately only a side effect of poor maintenance and upkeep.  Bathroom was in good order but had been decorated as if in a holiday inn express not an old country house, disappointing.,

Greeted quite grumpily on arrival, i almost felt i should apologize for having disturbed them.  Location is great, the building is fantastic but unfortunately not well maintained or cleaned.  Staff were very helpful when cornered, otherwise they were more than happy to ignore us.  Restaurant and bar only open about 50% of the time, both closed the day we were there.  The room we had was very spacious with comfortable beds and linen, bathroom was relatively newly refurbished, but not in sync with the aesthetic of the rest of the building.  Staff did speak English which was helpful and we were directed to nearby Brasserie Dampierre for dinner which was pleasant but expensive.  The Hotel building and grounds deserved so much more than was on offer.",negative
Breakfast didn’t start till 7.45,positive
"No kettle in the room, which is a little unusual.,

Good breakfast, ftiendly staff, big rooms.",positive
"Staff are not very friendly with just a few exceptions. Check-in takes too long. The gym is 5 machines squeezed into a corridor. No towels provided. Opens only at 7 am. One morning they had even run out of drinking water in the spa and I was informed that delivery would come after 12 o’clock, so several hours later! It took a few discussions and phone calls to arrange for bottle water instead. The crew was almost irritated by me asking although I had just come out sweaty from the gym. A few tips from my side:
• The tiny sport facility is a separate space. Put a water dispenser there, provide towels and keep it open around the clock! The spa can still be closed independently.
• Train your staff to understand the guests’ needs and think a little bit outside the box. Pay them extra for smiling, talking friendly and looking people in the eyes. 
• Make sure your supplies are efficient and your staff pro-active to keep the guests happy. It doesn’t take much!,

The restaurant food and the breakfast met expectations. The room was sufficiently spacious.",positive
"Poor refrigerator. Lack of a kettle.,

Nice little town. Nice room, quiet and well furnished. Good big playground for children.",positive
Location was perfect if you are based in Central Antwerp - 2 minutes walk from the nearest Metro (Astrid) and the bars & restaurants and 5 mins to the main station. We were based at the apartment for an event at the Sportpaleis which was a 25 minute walk or 5 mins on the Metro. Balcony was a nice added feature!,positive

Very friendly and helpful host - thanks again! Central location close to Antwerp's central station and about 15 minutes walk to the Groote Markt square in the historic centre.,positive
"The rooms were nice but nothing too fancy. Good for a one or two night stay but certainly not a luxury resort.,

the staff was very friendly and helpful when it came to storing my luggage and helping me to get an early morning taxi.",positive

the room is way better than we expected. The host is very friendly and helpful.",positive

"Location next to the park, but quite far from city center. They have gym and sauna. Price is good and that was main reason , but if you can pay 20+ eur more, you will find better accommodations ,

I think I was alone I  whole hotel :) , reception girls was almost sleeping. Basically really nothing that you can complain for such price",positive
"Nice and BIG rooms, clean, SPA in hotel.",positive

Cleanness, location,",positive
"Unfortunately, the girl on duty at the front desk on 30 December 2018 from about 18:00 hours onwards was not very friendly or helpful (she did not have a name pin).  We had to activate our key cards three times and every time it seemed like we were bothering her.  The restaurant/bar area was not well staffed and we waited for about 15 minutes to order two espresso.,

The location is perfect for exploring the town of Mechelen.",positive

location and size of apartment",positive
"Before you read this, please understand what I've mentioned here are all very minor things, but I believe anything can be improved. The breakfast was good but the eggs could have tasted a bit more natural. The croissant was somewhat dry and the yoghurt was a bit artificial. The elevators were fine, but at times there were too many people trying to use it, which caused a bit of a queue trying to get to our room.,

Great location near an easily accessible parking lot. The beds were comfy and the room was quite large. Having a separate bathroom and toilet is a pro; there was a separate bath and shower in the bathroom.  The room was very quiet so falling asleep was easy.",positive
"The bed was uneven, tatty bathroom, poor breakfast choice plus dirty crockery. Nobody around past midnight and I needed some boiled water! The manager wasn’t interested in my comments!,

The grounds",negative
"The bed was not entirely comfortable ,

Huge restroom",positive
"a little far away from the centre but OK if you take the bus.Breakfast could have been a much higher standard,

The room was ginormous!!2 bathrooms only for little old me.A hotel that realises that you need the light swicth next to the bed and NOT 10 different mood lights which all have different on/off buttons",positive

Location is perfect. Apartment was clean and very nice",positive

Very small room and small bed for two persons, didn't get the value for money. Bed wasn't comfortable at all and small to fit two persons.",negative
I like a breakfast. Very nice pancakes with cottage cheese.,positive
"Early entry was for half price.,

Was really good",positive
"We were supposed to pay upon arrival, but were charged the full amount a week before we arrived - not a pre-auth, an actual charge. We contacted Booking.com about this and were told they payment details listed for ATW apartments were incorrect and would be changed. The hosts spoke no English and we had to attempt to communicate in what little French we knew, which was a bit tricky. The apartments are located next to a strip club, so it can be quite noisy. There is a bit of a mosquito problem, which meant we got really badly bitten on our first night and had to close all the windows for the remainder of our stay, which made it very hot. Not everything that is listed is included and it sounded like a family of elephants were staying above us, as we could hear them stomping around constantly.,

Good sized apartment that is centrally located. The lady that checked us in was very friendly - she made sure we had everything we needed and even went as far as to show us how the TV worked and go to get fresh batteries when she realised the ones in the remote were dead. Check out is very easy, you just leave your key in a box and go.",negative

Selection of espresso drinks and teas available as well as champagne! Breakfast food was a 10+! Fruit platter, fresh breads and pastries, cheeses, prosciutto,  nuts, and eggs could be ordered as preferred.  The property has a large rooftop which overlooks the main churches and towers, with lounge chairs perfect to relax at the end of a long day and read a book.  Check in and out flexible to our needs,  the team was very available and concerned with our needs. I would recommend to all 100%",positive

Visited Gent on a cold, wet Spring weekend and the best part was this apartment. So comfortable that everyone wanted to just stay in.

The stocked mini fridge and the full jar of coffee pods were very much appreciated; and the morning fresh bread basket was also generous.

Mattias gave us a very warm and friendly welcome. The place is very clean, hip and fully equipped with all the good stuff you need for a overnight stay.

Lots of space and possibilities to welcome people at this property! Not just for a overlay!",positive
"I’ll repair. Several lights in room didn’t work. Staff once care about money and making the guests feel like we are there for the staff. Just horrible service. They do a really horrible job and then wish to change maximum they can. It’s really just crazy. They are at best a 1 star hotel. All other 4 and 5 star hotels have better service and less costly. Stay away from these evil ,

Good location, spa included",negative
"We were given a very warm welcome upon arrival! It was our first time in Brussels. We had a lot questions.. The staff at Hotel Le Chatelain were always happy to help.

The interior, clarity and space. We felt like home! Even my dog loved the space he could run around. Very dog friendly. We would go for an other stay over there.",positive
It says lake view but there was no view in my room. It was looking at the multi storey parking lot. The elevator was broken so i had to take the stairs all the way up to 8th floor. There was also no slippers in the room. Tv's usb port was useless. There is no such a thing as aquozone accessable room. It is all the same elevator. I dont recommend it to anyone.,negative

"1. Money Rip off. Travelers - be Careful! AVOID THIS HOTEL.When I did my booking via booking.com - I have chosen Lux room with 2 bedrooms and indicated 2x adults, and 2x kids 6 an 8 y.o age. Price was GUARANTEED by Booking.com 660 USD WITH BREAKFAST included. When I checked in - Hotel created a story about additional payment needed - to pay for ""kids breakfast"" and for ""kids linen. Tha costed 35 USD extra.At the day of checkout (early hours), at 0600 in the morning, when there was no time to discuss - counter told us we need to pay even more extra ""for something"". I had no time to argue and it was approx 6 euro on top for ""something"". That was not a mini bar or any service we used. That was ""something with reservation"".2. Air condition in our second bedroom - did not work. It was damn hot to sleep. Asked 3 times to fix the problem - nothing was done about this.AVOID AVOID AVOID!,

Big room. Comfy bed.",negative

"A shower instead of a bath or maybe a bath with a shower curtain would have been nice as now the only option to wash yourself was taking a bath.Some parts could do with a new or extra coat of paint.The baby coth is a little worn out and it's maybe best to have a new solid mattress for the baby bed as now it's a little too flexible.,

Fantastic outside fenced garden with lots of garden toys for children (swing set, slide, ...). Everything was clean and everything we wanted in order to have a good holiday was provided in the house.Very nearby great locations to visit (Redu, Grotte-de-Han,...).",positive

Breakfast was delicious and large for 4 people. Apartment was spacious and comfortable with everything you need!,positive
"- the room was not quite clean: the mattress had some suspicious spots- the personnel on the reception was too cold and unfriendly- the breakfast menu was really poor and it absolutely was not a good value, so we decided not to take breakfast in the hotel restaurant,

+ modern design of the hotel+ spacious room with big comfortable bed and clean bathroom+ good view+ excellent spa center (swimming pool, two saunas and jacuzzi)",negative
"The breakfast is not great value very expensive for what offered I went out to have a coffee in the bakery near by with more options of fresh bread and half price Anyway will stay again in the hotel as there is lot of restaurant and coffeeshops and facilities around ,

"There is not any visible advertisement with the name of the B&B. It took us 5-10 min before finding the right place.,

I booked this B&B simply because its location (near to La-Roche-en-Ardennes, Chouffe, etc), but it really surprised me: a modern house in the middle of the forest, everything is modern and clean. The highlight: an excellent breakfast. I recommend this place for a relaxing weekend in the ArdennesBTW, we also bought honey produced at the same place... super lekker!",positive

Everything was perfect as we wanted. Super!",positive
Top de chez top terrible week-end  super endroit,positive
"The bathroom floor can get wet if the shower door isn't shut properly but due to the heated floor it dries up very quickly.  Unfortunately, due to the country, you do have a smell of sulphur when running the shower but that's just a given and the water is still clean and the water in the kitchen to drink from is amazing, so clean and fresh.,

The apartment was in a great location, it was right near to the pond area and we walked into Reykjavik centre which was only a 10 minute walk.  We had hired a car to see other areas outside of Reykjavik and there was  street parking right outside which if you park from after 6:00pm and are out before 9:00am it is free.  If not then the parking was not expensive and very handy to be so close to the apartment.The apartment was a great size and lovely and warm after a day out in the cold.  We ate out some nights but had also visited the larger Bonus supermarket on the way from the airport and the apartment had a hob, microwave, dishwasher and coffee maker and plenty of plates, pans, cutlery to cook with which helped keep some of the costs down as Iceland is expensive to those who don't live there.The bed was really comfortable and the room a good size.  They have a television in the lounge should you wish to watch it The bathroom is on the smaller size and the shower is more like a wet room but the water was powerful and hot and there was underfloor heating which was really nice when you had been out in the cold.  They have a hairdryer so no need to take one if you are limited on luggage.Our other tip was that we took our metal coffee mugs and water bottles so we could fill these up before we left for the day to keep costs down and to save plastic when out for the day.  Lots of leaflets and paperwork as enter the building and a brochure with lots of details in the apartment and contact numbers, restaurant recommendations. We would definitely stay here again.",positive
"Quite, cooperative, helpful",positive
"The home is somewhat difficult to find. It requires that you turn off on a very small street that looks, at first, like a pedestrian walkway. Use your GPS! Although they do have a small and very nice restaurant near their home in the town, the walk although not excessively long is all downhill, which means that if you walk, the return trip is all uphill. If you have any walking issues, this may be difficult, and we decided that even though it was short we would drive.,

Although this was one of the most expensive rooms during our trip, it was spectacular. The hosts were kind and helpful.  They recommended a small restaurant for dinner that was located in the little village at the base of the hill on which they live that was excellent. The parking in the small driveway was ample and free. The room was absolutely beautiful and spotlessly clean. The TV was excellent with some English channels. The Wi-Fi was fast and free. The bathroom even had some small sample size products to use. The breakfast was absolutely wonderful with lovely coffee and a beautiful view over the back yard and garden area.",positive
Very nice helpful staff. Gorgeous view. Could use some renovation for the price you pay.,positive

We loved everything. It was peaceful, beautiful both inside and out and comfortable. We were very, very impressed and will be very likely to go back for more cycling.",positive
"It was a really hot night and the apartment has no windows or fan. ,

The apartment was amazing. SO well presented with everything you need in the kitchen and more! The fridge had some lovely surprises in and the staff were SO friendly and helpful. Secure off street parking with electric charging points was a huge plus. Also the restaurant staff were excellent and went above and beyond by cooking something off menu for the kids.",positive

"After some years, cutlery, dishes, glasses, etc... become a mishmash of different sets and it happens that things are no longer in balance (like a limited amount of wine glasses). I think a cleanup and refresh might be in order.,

New sofas had been installed the day of our arrival. Reception was super flexible and nice.",positive
"Room was very spacious with a central location (five minutes walk from the central square). I had forgotten that breakfast was included, so that was a bonus thing to be reminded of. Receptionist gave us a map of the area and some pointers of where to visit which was great, and we could leave our bags after checking out on the last day for a while, whilst we explored further. Great.",positive

Mosquitos!,positive
"First of all, the service. Girls at the reception didn't want to communicate, nice and I didn't feel welcome to ask any questions or assistance what so ever. I instead used google engine to look for the information instead of talking to them.There was a huge problem with my in-room breakfast. The reception provides you with a card (bad quality printing), with a number of dishes and drinks and no price in it. When I asked about the price upon my arrival, they suggested me to double check in the restaurant. I checked the prices and ordered a breakfast for the next morning. However, I was charged twice of that sum. It turned out that from 7-11 am they charge 25$ for any food ordered upstairs, which was a big surprise. It took me 24 hours to sort this out and the staff was very reluctant to do anything about it.On the friday evening there was a wedding upstairs, so it was very loud and noisy (even though I have requested a quiet room - ladies at the reception offered me to pack my stuff and move to another room at thr midnight). I assume that all the rooms from the 14-15th floor have such a problem. The staff couldn't do anything, so I had to call the reception 2 more times.Do not order drinks at the bar because the wine is not what is seems. I have ordered wine from Chile and it wasn't the one, moreover the bartender added water to the white wine (they use this practice to earn money).,

Overall, the room was nice and it was not far from the Minsk Arena, but I think these are the only advantages of this hotel.",negative
"When we got into room it was so cold an also toiler sink was stocked.
They came and fixed it immediately ,

"Poor service in restaurant and particularly the breakfast buffet - no cups, no glasses, chaotic seating, food items running out and layout a mess from one end to the other trying to find cutlery. Too many external young people in spa drinking beer and dive bombing the pool. Impossible for disabled guests to use stairs in the pool. People smoking in hotel bedrooms meant tobacco smell in corridors. Gift shop closed on weekends.,

Proximity to Minsk Arena and Zamok Mall.",positive
"The location is in the lovely area of Ixelles.We had an executive room which was pricey but spacious.  The beds were large and really comfortable!  We were there on New Year's Eve, but didn't want to be in the centre of things, so this was perfect.",positive

Large living area, breakfast, welcome drink (Belgian beer), friendly and helpful host, coffee machine, private off-the-street parking.",positive
"It was odd that you had to take your hotel towel to the spa.  Nobody smiles.  Nobody is friendly.  I think it’s more of a cultural thing but a smile and “hello” and a response of “you’re welcome” goes a long way and nobody says any of that.,

WiFi was excellent.  Location good.  Staff mediocre.  Lobby staff was much better than spa staff.",positive
"We wanted to order a pizza. I called the extension from the menu card, somebody picked it up after 10 seconds, and told me to call another extension.
It made me look like an indiot.
I called the extension. Somebody picled it up, so i told him we wpuld like to order a pizza. He told me, that he's gonna call me back in a minute. I waited for 3, and went down to the lobby to ask what happened. I saw our room number on a piece of paper. So the guy asked me if i called them. 
I told him yes, and i was waiting for him to called me back as promised. 
He told me he did, which is not true. My partner was with me next to the phone in the room.
They made me feel like an idiot 3 times. I mean this is a 5* hotel. DON'T DO THIS TO YOUR GUESTS!!!!!!
Please tell the guy at the room service (or the waiter) to smile after opening the door. Would feel better.
At the check out the receptionist guy was talking to somebody who came by, as i was in a coat, waiting to leave already. During the conversation he wasn't able to concentrate on the check out. 
Again: this is a 5* hotel. ,

Everything else was perfect.",positive
"Not that I didnt like it however be aware the apartment is on the top floor with NO elevator! So it is a cardio workout every time you want to leave and return from your day. Its on the 4th floor with a narrow staircase. Viva l’European style. I am a fit 60 year old so its doable!,

It was in the centre of the town with an exceptional view of the Meuse and surroundings. Steps to the citadel and the cathedral. Closed unfortunately now due to Corona but lovely to walk around!",positive

Location is superb! It's in a quiet area but still in a walking distance from the market square and most of the tourist's landmarks and shopping streets. 
We had a budget double room and it was very clean, has a comfortable superking size mattress. Bathroom has a very nice deep bath tub which was nice to use after long walks in the cold (we visited Christmas market) also the towel drier is heated! 
Breakfast need to be booked at 8pm prior and pay €12 p/p in addition to your room charge ( depending on the offers). Breakfast room is really nice and cosy, you can have a continental breakfast: selection of meats, cheeses, breakfast cereals, eggs, bread and croissants etc.",positive
"We liked it all, although for some people it might be further out of town than they would prefer (a 15 minute walk) and it’s a slightly untidy, but very respectable, neighbourhood. ,

This is a fabulous apartment in Gent, very straightforward to drive to with secure parking next to our accommodation and an easy walk to the historic centre of the city. Our host Sebastiaan was really helpful and friendly. There was even a dog park very nearby, which was great for us.",positive
"The staff weren't cleaning the room efficiently. For example, when it comes to cleaning the bed , they just put the blanket and don't care whether there's anything under the blanket such as shirts, charge and others. 
And even though it's safe but there is no camera's in the elevators and stairs where there should be.,

The location was perfect--not even 5 min from Menenpoort and the Grotemarkt. The small private patio was great--a gem in the middle of the city. We were pleased to be able to book this place on such short notice and with a great value for money. Bernard was a great host as well. From the moment I made the booking, he was super responsive and friendly. He even set up a baby bed for us, knowing that we were bringing our baby (although it was missing a mattress--we ended up using our own travel cot).

The ambience was good,positive
alles was TOP,positive
"The houses are probably better for summer than for winter- it was warm enough (with electric heating for about 35 Euro for three days), but it did not feel very 'cosy' (cold tiled floor). The walking way from the houses to the beach is along a relatively busy road (further complicated by roadworks). The house was freshly painted when we arrived and still smelled quite strongly of paint. The playground in the park felt a bit 'sad', but probably also because the nearby Brasserie was closed because of COVID. It is a shame that you cannot really see on the web-site which house you are booking, because at least from outside they looked quite different from each other.,

The houses in the park are nice and well kept and very functional. The little secluded garden is a bonus. The area around has all necessary shops within 2 min drive or 15 min walk (with a small child). The beach at Bredene was nice and much less crowded than other parts. Everything seemed clean and all COVID protection measures were in place.",negative
"No AC in the ground floor rooms (which was the reason during heat wave why we actually booked it and no indication that AC is not in all rooms). Breakfast is a little sad. As prepared the day before there is no fresh items, 3 different cheeses in plastic packaging, cookies ..,

The place was great and quiet. The pool area is small but lovely. Very relaxing.",positive

Excellent location",negative
"The double bed was up two steep narrow flights of stairs, and the sloped ceiling prevented standing up in the room. It was impossible to get luggage all the way up there. The single bed was actually a daybed doubling as a couch in the sitting room up one floor. You have to go through that room to get to the attic bedroom. But for the location, it is worth it.,

The location was incredible. The home was lovely. There was a thorough welcome pack with all sorts of tips and recommendations about the town. Also coupons for activities. Also the towels were big and fluffy! I also enjoyed the little enclosed courtyard. (Very tiny but nice in the summer)",positive

"No tea/coffee making facilities in room. Breakfast downstairs is expensive. Shower could do with an upgrade.  ,

Location fantastic - 100 metres from beach and bar district.  Got a very good price in early July.  Single rooms at the back small and a bit dark but perfectly OK for the price, and cleaned as soon as we went out.   All-night shop right next door.  Tram stop just around corner.  A little old-fashioned but we like that.  Luggage room for leaving your bags before check-in or after check-out.",negative
"Not much. We should be prepared (need) to do some preparation before coming down.,

The plot was situated on a small estate which was very nicely laid out. There was a good restaurant, as was the pool! A great place to relax and recuperate. the TV was OK but I was banned from looking at it! The locality was flat, flat, flat but you could get the miles up and in!

"Location a bit far need to walk for 35 mins to downtown or get a taxi for $3.
Make sure when booking the apartment to know the exact location. The owner has more than 10 apartments and all have the same location in booking but different location in reality 🤔,

Very well situated. Big sized room with a super comfortable bed and a massive shower. Very nice plus with a small kitchen available for the guests. Loved our stay and will definitely come back.",positive
"The room had no heating although it was 10°C outside, this is probably the biggest disappointment which made me rethink if 180€ a night was really worth it or not ... I asked the staff and they apologized because the owner didn’t fix this issue for several days ... the spa function of the bathtub activates itself during the night which scared us during our sleep. The breakfast was okay-ish, the chocolate bread and croissant were crisp, but the coffee tasted a bit like soap, which was a downside.
Conclusion : 180€ for a night for two? Absolutely not worth the money.,

The decoration and the bar was on point, the rooms were cosy feeling, the bathtub and the spa function were super comfortable. The staffs were super nice and serviable which makes this hotel above average. I think it could be a super nice hotel for an « end-summer » weekend and not a weekend « on the spot ».",negative

"I arrived at 19.00 as I had informed the staff previously.  It was raining hard and cold, and the staff had already left (Friday night), but the key code did not work, nor did anyone pick up the phone as per instructions.  Only after calling several times on the external line (from my phone) was my call answered.  However, the person on the line was not familiar with the location nor of the system for checking in, and therefore I was only able to gain access to my room key with the help of another couple who had been at the hotel before.  The room was very nice, but not the best for dogs - access via a narrow spiral staircase (dogs had to be carried). To be fair, it turned out I had been allocated the wrong room.  No doubt wonderful in the summer, and superb for weddings and family holidays, but not ideal for an overnight stay on a cold and wet night.,

Beautiful setting and buildings.  Nicely renovated. Comfortable room and clean.  Very quiet - although the hotel seems quite empty given the time of the year.",negative
"Location, clean, comfortable, really nice bath",positive

There was also a mini fridge in the room.We stayed over New Year and were delighted to find a small box of chocolates on the bed on returning back to our room New Years Day....it really is the small things that mean the most!! We had a car so getting round was easy...Brugge and Ghent are only about 25 mins away. Highly recommended!",positive

Breakfast was quite good - but the breakfast room was poorly laid out and extremely crowded.The modern bedroom was comfortable - but why does the shower door have to be see-through glass? Not wanted!",positive

"The hotel could easily be better than it is and has some nice arquitectural features , the managment have this rather insulting Policy of handing out the TV remote controls at reception then apply a 25 euro fine to anyone who forgets to hand them back. Although the guy on the front desk was charming and clearly good at his job, it was clear his boss has a lot to learn about the customer facing service industry. Departing very early the kitchen was locked so it wasn't possible to get more than coffee, A more generous management spirit would do a lot to raise the profile of this hotel.,

Its a great location, and it has a certain charm, above all the gentleman at the reception was great without whom I would have missed an important meeting he arranged a backup taxi for one that failed to arrive.",positive
"Light switches were either too sensitive or not enough, had difficulty getting the lights right but not really a huge problem.,

Lovely and relaxing! Nice quiet location and the bed was really comfortable.Breakfast available in the room is a great idea, it takes away any time constraint.",positive
"Nice, clean and comfortable apartment with air conditioning.",positive
"The bathroom seat in Gastenkwartier room 1was old and absolutely disgusting. The room as well as the 3 course dinner are much overpriced and not value for money. One (large) bottle of water was 8 euro's, it took 2 hours for serving the same standard meal to about 20 people who were all there at the same time and though the setting was  nice the meal itself was quite plain. Overall, a disappointing experience for the accommidation as well as for the dinner.,

Great setting in an old monastery and on big grounds. Quiet location.",negative

A cozy and large garden room, with kitchenette and shower. Everything worked well.",positive
"The lift was broken the first day, not great when you have health issue. Also altough it's not the hotel's fault the guests were noisy and you could hear a lot of noise when you were in your bedroom.,

the room was bright and spacious. check in was easy and the foyer was nice.",positive

"I would have liked to have a kettle in the bedroom to make a cup of tea and coffee instead of going to the ground floor.,

Excellent hotel, very clean, lovely breakfast. Staff very hospitable. I would recommend this hotel if staying in Bruges.",positive
"Some little things were missing.  There was a coffee maker, but no ground coffee.  A bowl with some mini chocolate bars, but no sugar sachets for hot drinks.  A hairdryer but no shower gel/soap.  A DVD player but no DVDs (particularly missed as we have young children).  A nice enough TV with cable channels but only one English language channel I could find (BBC First). There was a decent fold out bed, but the mattress cover was dirty.  These are only little things, but they are things that made us ever so slightly less comfortable. N.B. 1) There is free on the road parking, but between Mon-Sat/9-5, it is for two hours only (with a permit provided by the owners): 2) Check in is 5pm (!) but emailing the owners got a more reasonable check in of 2.30 pm.,

This is very well located. The house is a 5-10 minute walk from the Menin gate and the cute town centre.  The owners provide a local map and have put together some very helpful notes on what to do and see during your stay, as well as information on facilities in the house.",positive

"I do not understand why they did not put in a shower instead of a bath in the mini-sized bathroom. It was the smallest bathroom I ever had in a hotel room. A shower curtain would also be a solution.We heard the elevator the whole time because our room on the top floor (room 77) was next to the elevator.The food (ham, cheese, salami, etc) was not in a cooled counter at breakfast.,

Perfect location in city center, very close to the beach.Room was small but functional. Enough storage space for clothes.Bathroom was clean. Breakfast was OK.",positive

It has every little extra you can think of, including beer in the fridge which was so appreciated after a long drive. Everybody was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Although we loved the quirky stairs for two flights of stairs which weren’t s problem for us, elderly or infirm people may struggle here. All in all, a fabulous little house and we would definitely stay here again if we visited Ypres again. Thank you Bernard and Maria.",positive

My wife and I met the owner Ilse and she was very friendly and helpful. The service was excellent. Our room was super clean and modern. Everything worked perfectly. Our windows gave a wonderful view of the woods, with birds chirping. The place is located in the suburbs of a small town, which makes it very peaceful and quiet. There is a goat farm next door and the goats will come running towards you every time they see you. Restaurants and supermarket are about 15-20 minutes' leisurely walk. Kasteel van Bij Gaarden which hosts the Floralia Brussels for a month from 6 April to 5 May 2019, is about 30 minutes' stroll from Zen Your Life.",positive

Noisy and creating lots of fumes. Noisy street in the front. Homeless people rummaging in the trash out back. Nearby restaurant staff use the same porch for smoking at ground level. ,

Owner met us promptly and on time. Organized. Spacious, good bathrooms, two full showers, good kitchen. Fairly good location... Within walking distance of most of what we wanted. Overall great for four people for four nights. I wouldn't stay longer though.",positive

Since I was packed up, just had to wear shoes and walk out. I politely asked him to allow me a couple of mins and wait outside if that's ok? And he says, its check out time, I have to clean the room. Then goes back to cleaning my room and keeping my bag to the door and puffing the sheets almost to my face. Shocked and surprised, I walked out with open shoe laces. I have NEVER even at Starwoods or Relais and Cheateux or anywhere in the world, have seen or heard guests been almost asked to get out. I won't recommend this place because forget the service delight in today's world, this guy literally showed my stuff the door. ,

Other staff was polite and helpful.",negative

"I didn't have parking stops available. However, the porter managed to find a place in the street just in front of the hotel. He even stand there in the cold for 5 minutes to ensure that no one else could take the place. Shame I had no money in my pocket to give him the deserved tip. His advice was to book beforehand the parking stop to ensure its availability. ,

The room was perfectly clean and very comfy. The decoration is note very modern but I guess that's for being a botique hotel. Personally, I liked it. The staff was very polite and helpful. The best was the dinner at the restaurant. Fair price, very quite and cozy dinning area and the food was marvelous.",positive

Tea and coffee was in the room a bottle of water would have been a nice addition. Reception staff a little unfriendly and not very welcoming. Breakfast is budget standard. Canned fruit salad, fresh fruit bowl but fruit not so fresh looking. No coffee machine but big thermos coffee flasks mini canned sausages. It filled a hole but was nothing to talk about.,

Very comfortable bed (executive room)  nice bathroom. Brilliant location. Pretty breakfast room. Very clean hotel.",positive

"The room was small and a bit outdated, but that is expected for this location. There was no minibar and no water in the room. There was no airconditioning. There was a LOT of noise during the night. From other visitors in the hall and in their rooms. I could hear whole conversations and their wake up call.,

The breakfast was included but due to an early appointment I did not take it. The breakfast room looked nice, conveniently located and nicely furbished.",positive
"The other guests were very noisy (TV blaring at 1AM with the room door open) but that could happen anywhere.,

Nadia was super friendly upon arrival. Very easy to get to by train, €3.30 from Bruxelles-Midi and then a short walk (10 min). Spotlessly clean and very tranquil. Excellent Osteria close by for dinner within walking distance.",positive

We were greeted with a lovely smile as well as a beautifully decorated hotel and we knew from the off, we chose well, the room as well as the rest of the hotel was very clean, comfortable beds and pillows, as well as real soap and environmentally friendly shampoo and conditioner. The room, 16, a twin, had everything one would need for A comfortable stay. The area itself is clean, some good pubs, bistros, and a stones throw form the beach and Brighton town no more than 10-15 mins walk to the lanes etc. First morning we woke to a hot shower, and a fantastic breakfast room and the choice of food was the best we have both had as much travelled individuals. The home made marmalade was to die for, well done Charlotte. The staff were all very friendly and went the extra mile to please the guests. The deco of the whole hotel was very tastefully done with great care and precision. 
My friend and I would both be back either for another weekend getaway together or with our individual respective partners. 
Thank you for a very delightful, comfortable stay at your fantastic hotel",positive

I don't know what happened if I should use the stairs to my room because I had a large suitcase. Also, I didn't know what should I do if something dangerous happens!

Ligging perfect",positive
"Emailed them to request to turn on the sauna and to inquire for restaurants in the surroundings of the location but I have never received a reply. The cleaning was appalling, merely cleaning the surface of what is visible.  For example the lights by the bed were extremely sticky... and that was very unpleasant to figure out. The heating didn't work, the floor is cold and there were no slippers available for the guests.,

The location was close to the event I was attending. The breakfast, although simple, quite varied. Bed was comfortable and the shower was also nice. Can be cozy during summer.",negative

Great location, nice clean room.",positive
"Dark, quiet and comfortable rooms. The bed was big and soft. I slept really well there. Handily placed for Ghent and Brugge but not really anywhere itself.",positive
"I really can't point out any real problem with this accomodation. One evening there was some noise from the corridor (maybe from shared kitchen) until late, but it was not a big deal. These things happen and it's primarly problem with people, not with the guesthouse itself :-),

I can really recommend this guesthouse. For given price it is really outstanding accomodation. My room was quite small, but it wasn't any problem at all, because there was still enough space for usual needs. This applies to the bathroom as well. Check-in was superfast and I got my room even in the morning before usual check-in time which was really nice surprise! Guesthouse is in very quiet and safe area, its surroundings are nice and within a short walking distance there are a few possibilities to buy something. In ca. 10 minutes you can reach by foot a metro and train station Schuman just as a bus stop to/from the airport.",positive

"Taking into account the room prize, I would expect a bit more. For example, there was not even a water cooker in the room, one could only get tea or coffee downstairs, only black tea in this case. We also did not book the breakfast, because check-out was before 11am.,

Ideal location, just a couple of minutes walking from most city highlights. The room was clean and cozy.",negative

"It would have been great to have a couple of blankets and two more pillows. The terrace could use some maintenance. The TV was quite old, it would be nice if the apartment had Netflix or a way to connect to your own device at least. ,

The apartment was very well positioned right in the center and the place was very cute, appreciated the outdoor terrace.",positive
"The breakfast was amazing, and the staff as well! The room was better than I expected, I would definitely recommend the NH Brussels",positive
"I often like to make my own meals but there were no dishes available that could be used in the oven. Also, the shower was very badly constructed and the doors did not close fully, as a result while showering water spilled onto the bathroom floor ... which could prove to be dangerous if you are not paying attention and could have an accident by slipping on the wet floor.,

The original apartment we reserved, the Sandpiper, was no longer available as the person renting it before us tested Covid positive.  The owner was quick to find a solution and offered us another apartment closer to the city at no extra cost.  The location was excellent, very close to the city and the apartment was spacious enough for two people.",positive

"The wi-fi is quite poor, so you might need to use your own data at times. It can also get a bit noisy at night (people walking home from the bars). The check-out time is quite early compared to other places, but the apartment is VERY cute and convenient, so it's still worth the stay.,

The apartment was spacious and well-decorated with a nice large bed. We wish we could have stayed longer than one night! It's very close to everything as well. It was easy to find and simple to check in.  We will definitely stay here again.",positive

Everything was ready ,the place was spotlessly clean and tidy, bernard was here waiting and was a very good host with all the information you could need , and a most friendly person . The local facilities are very good with plenty to see and do ,
The town is just a short walk away parking outside the property is easey . And free parking is avaliable just the other side of the menen gate , 
All in all 10 out of 10 for sandpiper",positive
"The room's safe was not working, and we did not want to leave our passports and valuables while we were out. They said they were sending someone right away to fix it, but the person did not arrive for two hours and worked for a good 45 min. Any other hotel would have just moved us to another room, but they didn't. Luckily, we had family in the hotel, so we used their safe and went out to eat. When we came back after two hours, no one had shown up to fix it. We had to call again. Then the person came and worked on it. After a long travel, we were tired and did not like the aggravation. We just wanted to rest. We have been regular customers of the hotel and find that the staff is very friendly, but there is always something not working in the room. Otherwise, it's a good hotel, clean, very well located and close to the best shops.",positive

Nothing to fault. Fabulous breakfast and comfy accommodation with all amenities one could need. Great bed.",positive

"Excellent breakfast. Attentive, Friendly and professional staff",positive
The location of the apartment was perfect. We had a lot of rain so it was nice to be able to pop back from town to warm up. We loved the lighting and the quirkiness..even the stairs to the bedroom which demand a bit of concentration :-),positive
It was Marvelous. I really love the place. If i was rich I would have stay there daily.  The place and breakfast is very nice.,positive
"The constant dripping of the downpipe outside the bedroom window onto a metal gutter that sounded like a drum! This was only a problem during the last night of our stay (the only night it was raining) and was solved by putting a brush underneath the downpipe. However, I'm not sure what the neighbours would have thought if they'd seen me leaning out of the bedroom window at 2am!,

It was only a 5 minute brisk walk into the centre of Ypres.On street parking is free (paid for by the host) but you have to display a blue dial card on top of your dashboard and you're allowed 3 hourly periods from 9am to 6pm so you have to return to your car at 12pm and 3pm to re-set the dial. This can cause a bit of a panic when you're half-way round a museum but I'm not complaining because as I said, it was free.The stairs from the kitchen/diner up to the mezzanine bedroom are quirky and not suitable for everyone!The host lent us a 2-pin USB charger as we had forgotten to take our adapter.",positive
Highly recommended ... location and service,positive

The rooms are very nicely decorated and the owners make you feel welcome right away",positive

"The stairs have very restricted headroom, there is no warning sign on the stairs and I banged my head quite hard on following the host up the stairs as she had forgotten to warn me about the low ceiling. It would be easy to add a warning sign to the wall. (It does have a warning note in the welcome book, it it is easy to forget and hit your head on the ceiling)The main door lock jammed on our second day and we were locked inside the apartment, though the host arrived swiftly and quickly contacted a locksmith to open the door, we had to wait in all morning until the door was repaired so missed a few hours of our holiday, which was disappointing. The locksmith was very friendly and we had no more trouble after he had completed the repairs.,

Apartment was in a great location, well equipped, very clean, warm and comfortable. The host was easy to contact by phone, and was quickly on hand to resolve any issues. Easy car parking and within walking distance of the main square.",positive
17°C in the room!!!!,negative
"3 little packets of chips/peanuts were placed next to the kettle plate inside the cupboard (near the safe and where we hang our clothes) so we assumed it was free to take and was like ‘welcome snacks’. We discovered at the end of our stay that it was part of the ‘mini-bar’ thing, which was placed at a totally different place in the room (the fridge for extra drinks was also not even turned on). In the end, we had to pay 7,50 euros extra for those tiny packets (clearly too expensive for what it was)… We found it very sneaky as it should have been clearly mentioned and put with the drinks from the mini-bar then! The price of the hotel is also not cheap, so why make us pay additional costs like this… Another bigger issue we faced was the parking next to the hotel. Although it doesn’t belong to the hotel, it gives direct access to it and is convenient to use for travellers. We were asked if we came by car but were never warned about one IMPORTANT thing to take into account: we cannot exit the parking until 3pm on Sunday because of the market…,

Nice room, clean and spacious. Safe entrance too as the staff needs to check who is coming in every time! We requested a kettle for tea and coffee as it wasn’t clearly mentioned on the website and we found it in the cupboard when we arrived. Many thanks!",negative

The room was so much bigger than we expected - great value for money! The breakfast was very nice, we had it in the room. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Location is great.",positive
"The customer service could have been improved - one of the concierge gentleman was particularly grumpy and unhelpful, and restaurant staff were understaffed. ,

The architecture and colour scheme, high bedroom ceiling and windows that let in lots of natural sunlight, comfy green room house slippers and bed, breakfast spread, value for money rooms, and hotel location in a quiet suburb - while slightly outside the centre, it was actually nice to be away from the hustle and bustle and come back to a serene setting after a long day of exploring!

"Note that the hotel is somewhat outside the city centre: the central market is 30min walk. Spa access should be included in your hotel stay - and absolutely when you book a treatment. To ask for €70 access fee to the spa when you already booked a massage is rather outrageous....,

This hotel gets nearly everything right: stunningly renovated historic building set in amazing grounds, beautiful and comfortable rooms , very accommodating and friendly staff, yummy food and a gorgeous bar in the old chapel.",positive
"There was a problem with the shower. I think air in the pipes meant that it wasn’t as powerful as it should have been. However the shower room itself was lovely and soap, shower gel and shampoo provided.,

Fab location and such a warm and cosy apartment for a family of four. After spending all day walking around Bruges it was lovely to come back to the apartment which was stylishly furnished and lovely and comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped for making a meal. It had a cooker, microwave and a fridge.",positive

"Upon check-in, they took a deposit in the amount of the cost of living.  The carpeting in the corridors is stained. The view from the window on the wall of the neighboring building. The bathroom is very small.  Draining in the bath does not work.  To drain the water, the cork had to be picked out with a knife.  Far to the center.  We went by tram or taxi.  It is unlikely to be back in this hotel.",negative
"According to the booking it should be a triple room, but it was not. As I was traveling alone it was not bothering me, but it would be nice to get such an information about change in advance.,

I called the front desk three times, and then they bring another DRITY cup in the room, no bath bathrobe.The toilet is broken which can not flush. And there is no more room to change.  The staff can not fix it until 1:30 AM!!!The room is just not  prepared well. There is only one piece of facial tissue leff in the box. So the night I left in this hotel was a nightmare, I CANNOT USE TOIILET, NOT MORE CUP FOR MY WIFE, NOT TISSUE TO CLEAN THE NOSE!!!!The staff only say sorry but DO NOTHING,And I CANNOT talk to manager on duty at once. The only reply I have is just sorry from NEXT DAY.,

The staff is kind but helpless.",negative
"Kitchen closed between lunch (2PM) and dinner (6PM): you have to plan your trekking around restaurant opening hours, but that's a more general problem in this part of Europe. How about a few simple hot dishes being available non-stop?,

The staff are nice and make an effort of speaking more than just FR; mmuch appreciated. The breakfast was ample: you could make an extra sandwich for the day's trek. The location was handy for transport, if a little noisy. The facility asked me if I agreed for two single beds, but we managed to negotiate having them pulled together: a halfway-house solution.",negative

"Nothing very good under these exceptional times.,

Excellent, great choice and variety.  Location easy to find.  Plenty of room.",positive
"The living room area would benefit from a some kind of sofa instead of two very uncomfortable chairs. 
The oven is modern but not fan assisted so is very slow.
The bed was too small and not of good quality.
The dripping gutter directly outside the bedroom window is very irritating when it's raining, sounds very much like someone banging a drum...not pleasant!! 
The internet signal was poor at best and dropped out far too regularly.
The stairs that lead to the bedroom are uncomfortable at best, very steep, narrow and not easy to traverse if you are over 6ft tall. ,

The apartment was nice and warm, the shower is great, the bedroom was spacious and had a nice sized wardrobe, I recommend taking some of your own hangers. 
The location is great, very close to the Cloth Hall and the Menin gate, parking is ok, the landlord will provide you with a parking permit.",positive
"I just spent one night in this hotel and I was on my own. I have been leaving in Brussels for over 20 years and I've passed by this hotel hundreds times but never stayed there so this time I decided to book a night at Le Chatelain. I know it's a 5 stars hotel so I was expecting a 5 stars room. It was a tiny one (which wouldn't have bothered me eventually) located on the 3rd floor and the view from the window was awful a depressing (a dirty grey wall at short distance). See picture attached.I cannot stand air conditioning so I switched it off but a kind of fan noise was still there...and it stayed with me all night, I could hardly sleep a couple of hours. No way to turn it off! I guess it was the bathroom ventilation.The bathroom was also tiny and the pullout shower head located in the bathtub didn't stay properly in place-straight-so I had to hold it in my hands while showering to avoid water going all over the bathroom. I had one nail broken and was looking for a nail file but there wasn't any. No body lotion either!The bathroom bin didn't open with the pedal so I had to open it manually. I always appreciate a chamomile tea or tisane before sleeping but the coffee station only contained 2 teabags, no caffeine-free infusion at all.In a 5 stars hotel you should not experience all this so I was extremely disappointed and won't return to Le Chatelain.,

"The water pressure in the shower could be a bit stronger. And the water in the shower didn’t drain, my husband repaired it, but that should have been checked in advance and not by us. I guess it has longer been a problem because the door has already lost its coat of paint because the water destroyed it! ,

Everything was great! I got an email with the code for the front door and our apartment so the check in was very easy! We opened the door and found an absolutely beautiful apartment full of antiques! The kitchen was perfectly equipped (better than mine at home) and everything was very clean! 
The location is stunning. A step out of the door, turn left and in 30m you are directly at the most spotted sight of Brugge! You can’t live closer! Comfortable beds, extra pillows! It was an awesome stay!",positive

"Very noisy room next door at 6 - 7:30 pm and 11 pm - 1 am.  Sounded like prostitution.  Door between the rooms did not have a lock.  Though opening it, one could see that there was no handle on the door to the other room.  Theoretically one could not open my door. I did not find this secure enough and was frightened by the shaking walls and screaming.  I reported the noise to the front desk.  They said the hotel was full and my room could not be changed and that they would talk to the guest. The situation did not change after reporting it.,

Comfortable bed. Espresso maker in room. Friendly front desk staff.",negative

"Hard Pillows, mattress protector made you sweaty. Church bell rung every half hour even through the night !  someone was smoking in another room and it stunk our room out too. Had to open the massive window/ fire escape to get some fresh air even tho it was cold outside and plugged the door seal with toilet tissue so it didnt waft in anymore. One staff member was very helpful but another had no idea...english was poor. The car park you could pay 6 euro a night for but staff member had no idea how to work the card ? then we found out you can park in the square for free between 6.30pm and 9am so didnt need to pay for the car park. Breakfast was minimal for 6 euros each. You sat eating it while people played on the slot machines.... smoking !!!! ....had to walk up 3 flights of stairs to our room no lift. Room was okay but very very basic... It had no atmosphere.... there was a pic on the wall of a man and woman .... embracing ! ? it was a bit um...... odd !,

"Minor note that the Senseo coffee maker with provided pods makes fair ""American-style"" coffee, but it's awful by European standards. No problem, but Nespresso-style is much preferred, at least for us.,

Cozy apartment, very well appointed in a perfect location (next to the Vismarkt. Bicycles provided too! Few stairs to the apartment. Bed upstairs in loft with relatively low ceiling; fine for us. Bathroom small (shower inclusive), but nice and worked great for us (and rain showerhead). Essentials provided (including for cooking if you want to do that). Super easy check in/out which also helped for our late-ish arrival time. Would definitely recommend and stay again.",positive
"Quite lovely cosy place .,

Very friendly staff especially guy from reception I didn’t got his name but especially he was really friendly and helpful is a tall guy originally from Morocco he cares about guests like his own hotel!

The apartment is “quirky “ well equipped and well located. You need for nothing. The downstairs is open plan kitchen and sitting area with dining table and upstairs is spacious. Parking is street parking and we didn’t seem to have a problem. The need to use a parking permit is normal throughout Ypres and will be explained to you on arrival.",positive

Nice and friendly staff, conveniently located very close to Berlaymont and the EU area in general, rich and varied breakfast, covid proof measures well respected, quiet",positive

We had a busy schedule planned for a WW1 Centenary trip over four days. Apartment Sandpiper was perfectly situated in the beautiful town of Ypres as well as being within easy reach of all of the nearby WW1 battlefields, monuments, and museums. We also drove to the Somme region in France which was easily accessible from Ypres. The service was excellent and the apartment has everything you need for a self-catering short break. I would highly recommend Apartment Sandpiper. May plan another trip in the future.",positive

In a 5 stars this is a joke.- The reception & room service phone lines were busy 24/7. - The room service breakfast didn't match what they had on the menu (no meat at all, bacon etc). - The room furniture is very oldschool (ambassador suite). - Breakfast arrived 20 minutes late.",negative
"Could have stayed longer,

A little tricky to find at first as there are many different parts of Vaubanstraat depending on the house number.Once that is known, logical and easy to find, I turned left from the A37 onto Zillibekevoetweg-Steverlyncklaan then further on up the road, turn left into Vaubanstraat by the Volvo garage. La Chambre d'Amis 83A is a short way down, righthand side on the corner, a semi circular modern style property, satnav will probably see you outside number 83 next door.The friendly owner came out to welcome me into a stylish self contained room, with two beds and parking for my vintage motorcycle outside the large window, so you can lie on a bed to gaze at your pride and joy, as owners of vintage vehicles tend to do...The modern bathroom is clean and fresh with an excellent shower and the beds warm and comfortable.Set in a modern well tended area, it feels very safe and secure with a relaxing ambience, especially in the large, well tended lawn, small veg garden and hens in a run which supply your eggs.Breakfast is in your room, with Nespresso machine, milk sachets, sugar, tea, cutlery etc supplied. It arrives at your chosen time in the form of a traditional basket set outside your door and you can smell the warm rolls and croissants as you bring it inside, fantastic! If the weather is good there are seats outside to enjoy the garden as you eat. It,s a pleasant 10 minute walk to the town centre via the Menin Gate, and if you are here to do a poppy run as I do every October, it would be hard to find a nicer place to stay, with friendly, interesting hosts.Roll on next year.",positive

"As I'm used to going into licensed outlets due to my job and socially it didn't put me out, but someone with a nervous disposition but be a tad nervous walking into the bar/reception area, felt rather unfriendly even at 2.45 am in the morning.,

It served a purpose, our flight was delayed landing and we needed somewhere to sleep for a few hours.",negative

Decent cooking facilities, although little room to prepare food. Good comfy chairs to relax in and table for eating at. Comfortable bed, decent wardrobe space. Good information on local activities and services. Short walk to centre.",positive

I enjoyed this stay at August just as much my first visit a couple of months earlier. Within a gorgeous environment, this hotel just gets everything right: the staff is courteous and helpful, rooms are beautiful and breakfast is superb. The place has the quality of a peaceful haven and August is without doubt one of my favourite European hotels to escape to.",positive

The location was just perfect and the use of the bicycles free of charge was great!",positive
"None,

It is a very nice place located right next to the Euopean Commission  .Great Place",positive
"The only negative I had was the pillows there are only 2 provided which are extremely soft and thin. My husband and I took up the 2 rather lumpy hard cushions from the armchairs to put underneath the pillow which didn’t make much difference only gave me a terrible sore neck by the end of the stay. 
It needs better pillows and a couple of extra in the wardrobe for those who like more than one. ,

Fantastic location, everything you need for a city break, lovely and clean and a really good information/welcome book full of information about the surrounding area inc places to eat and prices etc. 
Would highly recommend but not for any one with mobility issues due to extremely steep staircase having to duck to go up and down.",positive

"- Room wasn’t clean when we arrived. There was dust in our room. Also marks on every wall. 
- Even though in the instructions of the hotel it said that we have to let the reception know for cleaning the room (because of the COVID-19 situation), we were in our room, early morning, and without knocking in the door and letting us know the lady that does the cleaning came directly inside. 
- Bar of the hotel closes at 19.30pm. It’s a bit early in August (personal opinion).
- Due COVID-19 situation you couldn’t get things by yourself for breakfast; you had to tell the lady at the bar everything you wanted, which makes the breakfast a bit annoying, to be honest because she was the only one attending all the tables.
- Breakfast extremely expensive for the quality.,

Property was well located. It’s not precisely in the city center but very close by.",negative
"The room was rather small with very poor sound insulation. We heard every passing of other guests as if they were coming through our room. The bathroom was not very clean and is quite small. We came late in the evening (end of August) and the room was cold. Good thing the host left us a small electric heater that solved the issue quick. But floor is all of ceramic tiles so this remained cold for the rest of the night.,

Parking is free in front of the house. The breakfast was quite ok, not on hotel level but good selection of food. The surroundings is nice with calm atmosphere. We were welcomed nicely by the host and explained everything.",negative

The hotel is elegant and well designed, like the Julien!Delicious night sleep and breakfast.Room service was awkward. The i pad asked how I would like to be contacted and I said via email. To say that the breakfast was coming. I received nothing and got into the shower and then there was a knock at the door. The scrambled eggs arrived and I assumed because there was a 25E package that there would be other things with it, the fact that this was not how breakfast is planned at August needs to be more clear on the iPad. There was no salt and pepper, which I mentioned to the young woman who brought the tray and she said, ""they won't need this."" Rather than, ""I will be right back with that."" Small things matter.",positive

It was mentioned on booking that due to my status (genius) the breakfast would be included in the rate of the room.Actually when I received the bill I was charged 29 euros for the breakfast!!

"The room is small and old.The hotel doesn't have elevator.The staff changed me from one to another and moved all my stuff without telling me. I left for work and when I came back, I entered into my room and my things were not there. They told me they changed my room and moved all my stuff. This is unacceptable! And also I was still able to enter the old room, that had someone else already.I tried to complain, but no one there speaks another language if not French (which I can speak a little bit, but can't argue). So I sent an email when I left to tell them my disappointment and didn't even get a reply with an apology.",negative

"Our room was called ""Sophie's Choice"". When I read the information e-mail from the owner, it definitely gave me pause as I wondered what I was going to. Thankfully, all was lovely but...why name a holiday apartment after such a bleak tale?! I never met the hosts to ask.,

Clever use of space in the room. A large, very comfy bed in the gallery, a well provisioned kitchen area and a comfy lounge area. The spotless wet-room has a translucent shower door between it and the kitchen - we were unfazed by this reduced level of privacy but some may have qualms....Lovely garden and courtyard areas; air conditioning that operated silently and well. Atmospheric lights, candles and matches provided; and a folder of information/tips. All correspondence/info was via e-mail and locks were codes for all doors so need to exchange keys. Helpfully, there is a secure luggage store for early arrivals/late departures and secure bike storage in the court yard.The apartments are very central but the city noise just completely stops within the road!

I thought the location was great and easy to check in and very happy to be able to leave my bags before checkin.  Room was clean and comfortable and well equipped.  The bed..... thank you for provided such a nice bed.",positive
"Clean your balcony it’s dirty. ,

Easy and safe",positive

"I don't have any adverse comments. The Hotel is at Budget level, but everyone was helpful and pleasant, and the room was good value for that area.,

New Matinal is in the central square of La Louviere, and adjacent to the underground car park and other amenities. The Hotel has been refurnished, and the rooms are themed and well appointed, but small. They have paid attention to sound insulation, and the only noise after hours is a buzz from the bar downstairs. The shower room is basic, with a small 'timed' shower cubicle but it is modern. The bed was comfortable with power available by the bedside. There is no air-conditioning. Breakfast is in the bar on the ground floor and is a good selection of local bakery, good fruit juices, fruit, and fresh good coffee from an espresso machine! Entry to the hotel is by key-card and is secure. There is no lift. Our room had opening windows which provided fresh air and no noise. This part of Belgium is very French, and English is not spoken everywhere. There is a good selection of restaurants in the town; Chinese, Greek, Brazilian, (see photo), Italian, Pizza, and 'local'.",positive
"One this visit we could not use the airco for whatever reason, and the room was really hot. We had to open a window to cool the room which meant we heard a lot of noise coming from the street. ,

For us this is the usual place to stay when we visit Antwerp. It is convenient located close to shops, an restaurants.",positive

"Quirky, charming accommodation slap bang in the middle of Brugge. There's a pleasant, large shared terrace and an upstairs loft for sleeping.",positive
"Nothing,

The hotel was excellently organised to deal with the new coronavirus rules including plenty of social distancing rules, sanitising stations and breakfast here all food was safely wrapped.",positive
"Check in not available til 5pm ☹️Very hot in downstairs lounge area in afternoons, no opening windows. Bedroom upstairs also hot; when windows are opened, street/traffic noise is loud. Earplugs worked a treat. Would benefit from fans or a/c. Steep narrow stairs need care.Apartment boasts washing machine and dryer; they are available coin operated, in a communal laundry“City view” is overstated, actually not applicable.,

Good location Comfy bedWell equipped kitchen, although some consumables would be handy; like paper towel, pepper, oil",positive
"Would have liked softer pillows 😁,

Wonderful staff, beautiful building and great breakfast.",positive
"No tv,

When we arrived we were impressed with the location. It is pretty amazing!
Beautiful place :)",positive
"It's a charming century old place and we enjoyed it but there is no lift so it's not adapted to people with difficulties to walk,

We should arrived there at 8PM but were delayed by traffic jams nearly 2 hours. Not only they waited for us but they reopened the kitchen to cook us a meal ! A very very good meal ! Thank you again ...We asked for the breakfast in room at 8AM and received a very nice breakfast in the room for 10 € each. We were on the second stair and they needed to do the stairs 3 times to take up the breakfast.Very welcoming people and very good cook, the meals were wonderful. We will stay there again.",positive
"The bed was not comfortable.
Towels were not clean.
The walls between the rooms are very thin, you can hear next room snoring.
The staf was smoking while I had my breakfast.
I had to ask for coffee by brakfast.,

Nothing.",negative
"Very good location, 10 minutes walking to Central station, 5 minutes to Mier Shopping street & 10 minutes to old section.
The room was so clean and comfortable and include safe box, tea maker, iron, refrigerator, minibar and ... . 
Breakfast should be better with more choices.",positive
The staff were friendly. I liked the added security of the key card in the elevator.,positive
"There was no free food like some snacks on arrival. Would be nice.,

Perfect apartment. It was clean and light and the location was very good.
We all think it was fine.
I would recommend it. (Bring your own food)",positive
"We had two nights stays on different weeks. First night stay lovely ,great room.
Second nights stay was up in the roof with no head room to sit up in bed .Both myself and my wife kept hitting our heads.,

First nights stay in a decent room.",positive
"Stinks of smoke.
Rude member of staff on evening (blonde guy). INCREDIBLY rude. Room disgusting. En-suite do small you can’t sit on toilet. Nasty sheets. Smells DISGUSTING. Parking card didn’t work. Breakfast is day old croissants. Completely REVOLTING PLACE. Would NEVER  stay there again.  ,

Good location. The staff was friendly. The room was clean.,positive
"The room was a little aged. All of the electrical fittings were yellowed from age, gave the place a bit of a cheap feel... plus a loud hum from the electrical source when the halogen lights were on.,

Helpful staff when I wanted to add late checkout to the booking.",positive
"No tv,

Great host!
They were super friendly.
Beautiful apartment and super nice area.
Most central place i have been to in Antwerp.",positive
"Less mosquitos please 😁,

It‘s like a boutique hotel with few rooms. We had #4 with river view (la Meuse/the Maas). Room was like a small flat, much more than I expected for 69,-€. This house is mainly a restaurant, so don‘t expect standard hotel services like 24h-reception. Breakfast was plenty with standard products at 10,-€/pP. I liked the bread and the coffee and the Marmelade best.The restaurant is quite good, and there are some good Chinese close to this place. Consider you are in a suburb of Namur. The road is busy by day but quite by night. Make sure everybody of your group is able to climb stairs.",positive
"There was cigarette smoke all over the hotel, though ""no smoking"" labels were everywhere. The only opening window could not be properly closed. But at the same time, it was not possible to ventilate, because the fried air smelled from the outside.It was not possible to regulate the water temperature in the shower, sometimes warm, sometimes cold.The bed was uncomfortable, and at night the sighing of the couple from the next room woke us up.The room had few electrical sockets.,

The hotel room was clean.",negative
A lot of the lights and fixtures were not working,positive
"No tv,

The location is incredible!
It really is on The Meir shopping street, but the apartment is on the quiet side. So there is no noise. 
Beautifull building and super friendly host.
Why is this not more famous??",positive
"Excellent all round. Food superb, staff brilliant. In fact everything about the place was excellent and I would definitely recommend.",positive
"Bed was laced in Bedlice🤮 couldny sleep for some slut getting punished in the room next door aswell, left at 6am feeling like a tramp",negative
"Perfect,

Everything was new. 
Super clean and THE BEST location possible.
It was right on the main shopping street but on the queit side of the building. So no noise from the street.
We loved it",positive
"Nothing worth commenting on,

Wonderful views from my top floor bedroom.  I had a turret where I could use my laptop and watch the river go by.  All the staff were excellent and could cope with my somewhat lacking attempts to speak French.  Ate in the restaurant three times.  Food was excellent.  Breakfast was provided by a very helpful and cheerful young lady.The room was clean and spacious, with a very comfortable bed.",positive
"Don’t stay here unless you enjoy listening to friendly young women conduct their business at all hours.,

The erotic picture on the wall was interesting",negative

all good,positive
"Deception total,

Nada!!!",negative
"It seemed like it hadn't been cleaned at all for quite some time. There was a lot of dust and hair on the stairs. Floor was sticky. 
The living room/kitchen area was very empty. Just two sofas, a coffee table and en dining table. No TV or anything else. There was wifi. One of the chairs was broken.  
The bathtub was clogged. 
The hostess explicitly asked for a 5-star rating, which came across as rude. You don't ask for such a rating, you deserve it. And this appartement does not deserve it.",negative
"Stairs, but I’m getting old.,

Beautiful location on the river, large room (and bathroom) with everything I needed. Staff were friendly and helpful, even those whose English wasn’t much better than my French.",positive
"Bit noisy but you get that with the street just out front.,

Breakfast was huge and very tasty. Sitting by the window overlooking the river and having the early morning sun come onto your face. Rooms were spacious with all linens provided. Superb view over the river from the tower room we had.",positive
"Just a warning that stairs are required to get to room and to get to room 4, it is a bit of a climb for older folks.,

Car parking next to building. Nice restaurant with spacious terrace. River with dramatic cliffs across street. Room was huge #2. Saw room #4. Both 2 and 4 are in the turret with 220degree views.
Breakfast is simple per regional standard. Bed is comfortable. Photos are of room 4. No skylight in room 2.",positive
"Perilous stairs to the mezzanine bedroom if you've been drinking Belgian beer all night! Toilet and bathroom downstairs next to kitchen. TV had very few channels in English. No DVD player.,

Excellent location. A minute walk from the most famous view in Brugge! Parking just around the corner for 8.70 Euros/day. Cosy flat. Nicely decorated. Decent kitchen facilities. Good shower. Comfortable bed. Hairdryer in a drawer.",positive
The bed is amazing! The courtyard is a nice addition and the bikes are a must around town. The place is clean and comfortable and the location couldn't be better,positive

The location, amazing decor, freedom of it being self catering, lovely staff in the hotel.",positive
"Everything was great there,

Lovely place full of personality and very clean. The best is the kindness of the owner, the cosyness of the place and the gorgeous breakfast. We will definitely get back everytime we stop in Kortrijk.",positive
"Low ceilings and showerhead. Lack of adequate towels for out stay provided. Had to duck to climb stairs (I am 5'6""). Bitten badly during our stay by what I thought was mosquitoes later diagnosed by a doctor as bed bugs. Woken up by workmen as early as seven am on two occasions.  Workmen's tools and broken furniture left in front of our door.,

Location convenient and free bikes a nice perk",negative

Breakfast was fabulous.",positive
"This apartment was literally an absolute gem for my girlfriend and I. So much space inside, everything we needed was there, really REALLY clean :) I think Sam has done a great job with this place and i would definitely recommend it to many of my friends and families who are planning to stay in Brussels. Also a nice added bonus of secure underground parking for your car.
The location is great, if you like walking its only 20 mins to the centre and you want to drive everything is relatively close by.
20 out of 10 from me. Merci Beaucoup 👍🏿",positive

Breakfast was very good and very well organised by great staff. Reception staff were very nice, efficient and helpful. Would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel.

This is a very modern, very well equipped flat. The landlord is kind and responsive. There's a large supermarket within a short walking distance, which is very convenient.",positive

"Breakfast poor
Smell in entrance hall,

Location, price and helpful staff",positive
"Whilst the bed was comfortable, the pillows were rather hard.  The Moroccan feel to the B&B was welcoming and very authentic, but this meant that the lighting in the room was very low.  It would have been nice to have a slightly brighter light in the bathroom, for example.,

My room was comfortable and staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Location was perfect - 10 mins walk from the station and just off the high street.",positive
"Rude staff, not very communicative nor willing to explain things",positive
"During winter timer it was cold but the heating is working very fast.German tv is missing.,

It is a big and very modern appartement with a good environment. The host was very helpful and managed all my questions very fast. The public transport is close by but there is also a parking space in the ground floor.",positive

Separate toilet from bathroom,positive
"Shower was tepid, but resolved on second day.  Radiator was a bit noisy.  Limited storage space.While not expecting a lift, the stair to the second floor is rather steep.,

Good breakfast, central location.  Comfortable bed.",negative
"Upon arrival at the B&B we were standing for a closed door for like 20 minutes, rang all the bells on the door but no one opened. We arrived in Kortrijk at like 11:00 but check in is only possible after 16:00 which is a very unusual tbh. I had to call the lady of the B&B and ask her to let us in. When it came to the administration of the check in it is not properly organised at all. The booking i did was pay upon arrival but still they deduct half the cost of my account weeks before. When she asked us to pay i still had to pay +200€ while the total of our booking was 190€ so she totally ripped us off. I ended up paying over 300€ in total. Also she does NOT accept card payments, cash only which to me looks like she is taking bookings under the counter to avoid taxes. I am originally from Belgium and that is not how we run places there!!!
I refused to do cash only and managed to convince her to accept my card payment as i knew she was ripping us off and this way i can file a complaint to booking.com and also claim my money back via paypal for the prepayment she already took of my card. If you pay by cash you have no proof of payment as she does not provide you with any receipts !!!
The room itself was beautiful and the beds were great. The bathroom had a sink that was leaking onto the floor, very poor plumbing, one of the buttons to flush on the toilets was broken and the knob of the shower to turn on the water fell off. We didn't bother mentioning any of it because we did not wanted to ruin our daughter her birthday weekend.
SIDE NOTE: on the second day we were there, there were 2 other girls that arrived at the B&B and again the owner did not open the door for them as she was not present at the house. We let the girls in as they were standing outside for like 15min and it was getting ridiculous.,

I loved the Moroccan style interior, we stayed in the triple room with our daughter and was very nice. The B&B definitely had charisma and felt like home, the lady always made sure there was enough water, coffee and tea for everyone. My daughter also received a small birthday gift which was very nice of the lady.",negative
"Awkward design of the lobby with so many levels and stairs...Small bed,

Location, amazing friendly staff, cleanliness",negative
"There are only half of the curtains in the living room. The bank building is opposite, and the lights are all too bright at night.,

The apartment is 10minutes walk from the subway station. The room is very spacious and comfortable. Kitchen utensils complete.But the room will be noisy by the main road till morning.",positive
Peter and Catherine are fantastic hosts,positive
"In a lovely street, the apartment is close to all shops and restaurants, walk distance from the beach and offers all the comfort you need for a relaxing weekend away. There is an assigned garage for the car which makes the whole trip hassle free. Sue Anne gave us all the information we needed; the check in was very efficient. We were there as a couple, but it would definitely serve a small family too. Highly recommended!",positive
"Service and staff, restourant",positive
"There is no separate entrance for the studio, you need to go through the house to reach it. However the owner is very discreet, at no time did we feel watched. The swimming pool is beautiful (it really is as big as it looks in the pictures!) Ask for the breakfast option, it is well worth it!",positive

"Lady does not speak english. Check in is at 16:00! New one to me, and the check out is at 10:00 if you consider the time in between, I might as well sleep on the street. Nobody was answering the door, was ringing for good 15 minutes. Prior that I visited the property 3x times, nobody was there (in hopes to leave the bag so I can go around the town) ended up carrying all the stuff with me to the exhibition that I needed to see. Very bad, money driver, will not choose again!,

Lady was smiling, offered teas, beers, etc,. but when you are in a bad mood you just want to crash. Especially after not being answered the door multiple times.",negative

Very spacious room. Ours even had a balcony which was quite large and offered some good views. Friendly staff. While they don't have onsite parking, the public garage is very, close by. Reasonable breakfast.",positive
"Tiled floor in rooms very cold even with radiator on. ,

Situated 1 minute walk from the town centre. Polite, friendly and informative staff. Very good breakfast. Good value for money.",positive

The staff is wonderful, and you really feel they are there if you need help. I am a returning guest.

"Nothing, everything was perfect and far surpassed my expectations. I would certainly recommend it to friends and I would stay there again if visiting Ypres. It was ideally located and within easy reach of all the main attraction.,

The breakfast was excellent and good value for money.  The breakfast table was topped up regularly and everything was fresh. There was plenty of choice and the it was served in a lovely dining room, it was like being in alarge house rather than a hotel.",positive

"We were a group of 8 adults and two children and we booked 2 apartments. It was perfect. 
The kitchen had everything we could wish for, dishwasher, stove, oven, microwave, even spices, tea and some free coffeepads :) They also have a hairdryer in the bathroom.
It's perfect for walking in the city center, and it also only takes 10mins with the tram to the Train Station. The host was very friendly.",positive

The layout of the apartment and amenities were really good",positive
"Everything was fine. Alex met us and showed the property even very late in the evening (after midnight) since we delayed on the Customs for several hours longer than it was planned from the beginning.

"Just minor details, really: coffee/tea facility in the room was ok, but very basic; just a bag of instant coffee and some teabags. A cookie; some honey for the tea, instant chocolate and/or a complimentary bottle of water etc. would give it a touch of luxury. Even better, an Nespresso machine would have been truly lovely.The hairdryer in the bathroom looked exatly like the ones they had in community swimming pools in the 1980's in my home town. I haven't tried it.,

spacious room. Very quiet, as requested - we didn't hear any neighbours, lovely! Nice, good-sized bed. Breakfast was quite wonderful.",positive

The apartment is cozy and looks exactly like the pictures. Well located (less than 10 min walking till the city center) and full of light. The beds were comfortable and everything was tidy and functioning well. The heating system worked wonderfully. Would stay longer. Even though the maximum of ghests is 4, I believe it might work for up to 6 people.",positive

"The parking was an issue, the meters were outside the apartments but we couldn't park because of garage restrictions.  The host told us where to park near by at a reduced rate but we couldn't find it, he indicated by nodding his head in the direction where to park, but when we went to find this area, couldn't find it even in daylight.  It would have been handy to give us a small map and the parking requirements in advance.,

We arrived earlier than the original time given as we were able to get a Euroshuttle train a couple of hours before the original booking.  The host was there to meet us and show us what to do and give us the keys.  The apartment had all the necessary equipment, tea and coffee facilities.  Beds were comfortable.  Liked the space and location of the apartments.  It was of a good standard.  Clean and comfortable.",positive

Very unique place, a bit old-fashioned but with all what you need if you do not expect Hilton standard.Good breakfast, friendly service, clean and warm. Access to tea, coffee, etc. 24 hours.Perfect Internet, perfect location.Garden and calm atmosphere.Fully recommended.Robertps: however, you should be aware that toilet and shower are the common ones, not in rooms but on the floor; but this is absolutely sufficient if you have a good planning in the morning ;)",positive
"Amazing suite with stunning garden. The owner provided great hospitality, we felt like home! We will be back soon!",positive
"A bit far from the town. Have to have a car to get to town. 
A bit too many stairs for small children and no toilet in the upper floor.
And we some issues after leaving. We cleaned after us but apparently the owner expected more from us and requested our guaranty money to cover more cleaning services even though they where included in the price. 
Eventually we didnt agree and didnt pay. ,

The appartment is beautiful and very large. Everything is new and there where a lot of toys for the children to play around. They had bicycles for us to use. 
The owners where very friendly and gave us tips for how to get downtown and so.",negative

The apartment is cleaned and has all you need!!! Pavel came directly to give us the key and to explain all... All is included: towels, linen, toiletries, cleaning stuff)...Thanks a lot... we really enjoyed our stay!",positive
This was such an interesting place to stay. The tables were shared at breakfast so it was possible to meet delegates from around the world who were using the facilities to host meetings. The grounds were beautiful. I loved the whole city's stylish design and this building was no exception. It wasn't far to walk into the centre of Brussels or to the nearest metro. I loved the early check-in.,positive

Verry good service and friendly staff!!,positive
"My room on the ground floor only had a velux style roof window that closed when it rained (obviously) no other windows for natural air in the room, just felt a little airless and stuffy, even though there was a fan. Cannot comment on the other rooms.,

Breakfast was fend for yourself which was ok, it was quiet as only appeared to be 2 people staying, the breakfast area decor looked old day style that l really liked but might not be to everyone's taste. The owners kindly let me park my motorbike in their garage area.",positive

Comfy bed, quiet room, excellent breakfast",positive
"It would be helpful if the host provided information about collection of the keys.  It would be great if there was a kettle in the apartment.,

Old room need updated and has the feel of an old guest house. ,

Very clean. Great showers, huge bed and lovely breakfast",positive

Liked the firm bed, kettle was provided, mugs, wine glasses, fridge. Enjoyed access to the roof top balcony from my room (6th floor). The on-site restaurant serves delicious food (I was there for dinner).  It was great to have 2 types of eggs for breakfast and a variety of cold cuts and cheeses.",positive
"It's a minor point but water for boiled eggs needs to be boiling! Also a bigger toaster would help but all in all not a bad stay and value for money. Being able to arrive and drop things off would help as the check in time is 4 pm. ,

Value for money was excellent, room size, location was great and the hotel reception was good. Also garage parking for up to 6 motorcycles (at a push)",positive

"The reception was icy (both figuratively and literally, as I arrived one day before they switched on the heating and the house was freezing), the rooms are very small, the walls are so thin you can hear your neighbors breathe, there is no lift and the stairs are quite steep, and the toilets/shower are in the corridor. The breakfast is VERY basic (nothing warm - no eggs) and the coffee unspeakably bad. Bring your own instant coffee - because it's worth coming anyway.,

The atmosphere downstairs is really nice, the bed is quite comfy despite its small size, and there is plenty of hot water in the shower. There is a very nice garden. The hot drinks at free disposal are wonderful (at least for the teas, as the coffee is not good.) Also, the value for money is really good. Despite all my criticism I would gladly go back.",positive

"At least a small piece of soap or shower gell would be very much appreciated, as when you arrive very late in the evening and those things are not available, it could be problematic. There are no cafes nearly; for getting breakfast or dinner you need to take a walk to the city center,

The rooms are comfortable and suitable for family with kids or travelling with friends. The kitchen was very clean, very well equipped, you can find all you need for cooking. There are coffee machines, also as coffee/tea provided by hosts.  The tram (number 4 ) is easily reachable, just around the corner; thus to go to the train station is very easy",positive

Spacious aparthotel rooms well located for Bruxelle's Midi train station,positive

Breakfast was ok. No real fruit juice though. Would like fruit salad too.But ok.",positive
"The bed is big but it is something like two single beds connected.. So you have to deal with the division on the middle..,

Apartment quite big.. There you can find a bedroom, bathroom without toilet seat.. A toilet room closer to the kitchen.. Living room is attached to the kitchen..Location is really good.. Close to the Gare du Midi station.. There and near there you can find metro, buses, tram and train.. You can also take the airport shuttle bus on a side street of Gare du Midi station.",positive

"Parking was a pain as their regular park garage couldn't be used because of odd Sunday hours and they didn't provide the parking stipend for another park garage a block away.  Parking was 18 EUR per day, otherwise it would have been 14/day.,

Good breakfast and nice sized room.  The WiFi was efficient and consistent, especially for Europe.  The excellent Saturday market is 100 meters away!",positive
"While the public transport options to get you to the main highlights were quite reasonable, Ghent’s ticketing system was far from clear. Perhaps it was just the weekend we were there, but Sunday travel turned out to be free and when travelling back to the station with luggage, the bus driver said we didn’t need a ticket. Perhaps he was just making sure we left town!,

Very well equipped and comfortable apartment not too far from the centre of Ghent. Aircon and a lift to third floor were much appreciated. And the provision of good quality bicycles would be a bonus for some.Pre-arrival communication from our host was excellent as was the check-in process.",positive
"Enorm ruim, zeer comfortabel. Zeer relaxte host.
I booked this apartment for my husband and a friend as it is a very close location to shipping company we used. After a long drive, they were absolutely pleasantly surprised by my booking. If you need to stay in the area of Antwerp, this is a very nice place to stay.",positive

It was a complete different experience than regular hotels. The place is a former monestary, and still holds that vibe of tranquility. The staff is extremely friendly, the rooms simple but clean, the breakfast is tasty, and the location is excellent with a metro stop near and the city centre and EU quarter in walking distance (15 mins to Schuman roundabout). It has shared bathrooms and showers, but these were very clean. 
A very comfortable stay and I am glad that I will stay at the Institute again in some weeks.",positive

Clean, modern functional hotel. Nice sized, basic room. Lovely reception staff who spoke English and were very helpful.Breakfast was varied and plentiful.",positive
"As with many budget hotels this was little basic but I am really struggling to find anything wrong at this price.,

In all honesty I was a little nervous having read some rather poor reviews on TripAdvisor. I needn't have worried as the hotel was perfectly adequate for our requirements. It is a little basic but it was clean, comfortable and perfectly located for the centre and Menin gate. The chap who greeted us was very friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything. There is free parking available a few streets away but it only cost us 2 euros to park right outside the hotel for the night. The breakfast was typically European but there was the added bonus of freshly boiled eggs. There are probably better hotels nearby but you will pay a lot more for them. The marble staircase in the breakfast room is lovely. I will use the hotel again.",positive

Great location and friendly staff. Unfortunately doesnt make up for lying awake every night!",negative
"I am a very frequent traveler, staying in multiple cities all over the world, but the service provided in Orbita was the best all across the locations I’ve been in the past. The stuff is the most kind, supportive and welcoming, I’ve ever experienced. The level of professionalism is exceeding all possible expectations.

Loved the ambiance, cleanliness, modern facilities, location. Beautiful building and rooms. Great shower. Located in an area of Brussels we’d been unaware of. After spending some time in the age-old part of town, it was nice to come face to face with the newer part.",positive

Great breakfast,positive
Great location and nice and quiet area and the room was very nice a little difficult to find,positive
"Room a little on the small side.,

Great location with free parking on the road outside.",positive
"The breakfast was expensive. I was charged 25€ but told it was 22.5€. The location was a little farther from City Centre than I liked. There weren't many restaurants nearby. In the room, there was really limited sunlight due to the concrete wall. 😒,

I loved most things. The staff were really helpful and friendly. I loved the in room fridge and coffee machine. I loved that we could take extra coffee and tea with us. The facilities were clean and luxurious.",positive
"Parking,

Apart from parking everything",positive
"Nothing to complain.,

Close to Puskinskaja metro station. Price was reasonable, but the equipment was enough. Soundproof windows are installed, so the room was quiet. Nice Breakfast. Receptionists helped me in English. Everything nice.",positive
"If the two bedrooms are full you have to share the bathroom.,

It’s a nice house in the countryside, very spacious and quiet. The owners are so nice and welcoming!",positive

"Marc was a great and helpfuly host. He helped us to plan our visit of  Museums WW2 - thanks very much! Every day was fine breakfast. Hotel is oriented on quiet place near to the Bastogne. Rooms are clean and all the rooms in hotel have special WW2 decoration.  We will be happy to remember on this vacation and we will be happy to come back on this place. Best regards Tereza and Michal",positive
"Couldn't check in until 4.00pm.  We had riden 250 miles and arrived at 2.45pm to be greeted with ""check in at 4.00pm"".  Fortunately they allowed us to leave our biking gear in the corridor and get changed as it was 34 degrees that particular day.,

Close proximity to Menin Gate & Market Square, parking right outside.  Spacious rooms.  Hotel was very clean and tidy and quiet.  We had a room that overlooked the road, but did not hear any traffic noise.",positive
"It seems like the hotel is divided into 2 parts in which we stayed on the back (maybe older) part of the hotel. 
It was ok its just that it requires going up and down the stairs everytime ,

The breakfast is definitely a must try! 
Room was clean and spacious i’d love to come back!",positive
"The shower tiles weren't clean. They had black crap around them,

The generous space",negative
"Some street noise from the busy trafic outside.,

Good hotel in the Minsk suburbs. Location is good next to the metro entrance, there are shops and fast food outlets around.  We stayed in a standard twin room which was very comfortable. The bathroom was modern and very clean. We had a goof stay in the Orbita and I can recommend the hotel!",positive

great breakfast! clean rooms, huge comfortable beds and toilets were clean too. the hotel is located about 4 stops away from the main city square but we had no problems going back and forth. was nice to stay away from the busy centre.",positive
"Old, sad hotelRoom was dirty and not updated to modern facilities,

Nothing, only good thing is the location",negative
"We got some street noise from the busy streets around the hotel.,

It's a big hotel in the suburbs but the area is safe and shops are around and the metro is just steps away from the hotel. We stayed in a standard twin room and it was comfortable with a modern bathroom. Cleanliness very good. For this price I can highly recommend the hotel Orbita",positive
"Wonderful place with fabulous owner. This is the place which you never forget. Huge house with natural and a bit wild garden, very spacious room and private bathroom. I had the most comfortable bed in my ""travel-life""! Scottish owner speaking perfectly English of course is a real gentelman, probably one of the lasts in this world. Great breakfast in the very pleasant kitchen. Also localisation is fantastic, you can go on foot to Waterloo. We are happy - we have found our place to stay  in Belgium! For sure we will be back!",positive
"no reasons to complain. everything was very good,

nice rooms, nice environment and very friendly staff.",positive
"Nothing 😊,

Beautiful and charming auberge in wonderful rural setting. Picturesque buildings full of character, with comfortable and tastefully decorated rooms. A true oasis of calm, set in gentle countryside that invites for walks. Very warm, welcoming and helpful hostess. Excellent breakfast. We also enjoyed a good dinner menu at the auberge. Would highly recommend.",positive
"That you can't put your feet into the see during breakfast! Oh, ok just joking! ,

Just about perfect: location, room, amenities, hospitality. What we really liked is that breakfast is optional, as the location included a bakery/pâtisserie and tea room of the highest quality. So youbcan breakfast whenever you want and compose something that will satisfy your cravings. If not, YOU really have a problem.",positive
"It was unclear if the breakfast room was available as a sitting room. We don't like sitting in our room at night. We enjoy visiting with other guests or at least having a place to sit and read other than in bed.,

Our room was large, the decoration was bright and colorful. The bed is very comfortable. For breakfast there was a good selection of sliced bread and croissants. The homemade jams were delicious. Fresh squeezed orange juice was available. The ham and cheeses were good. Marc the host was friendly and responsive to our requests.",positive

"Found it quite basic this time around for the price,

Location",positive
Pleasant and helpful staff. Beds comfy and breakfast plentiful. Great location.,positive
"$33 for the cheapest room is too much$10 for breakfast is way too much, the food looks like it belongs in a soviet prisonAll the rooms I stayed in have badly fitted windows, which lets in the cold,wind, and noise. A cheap problem to fix, but they seem not to care.There is a pizza restaurant that looks very uninviting, and there isn't even a menu, I did not take a chance and I suggest you don't take a chance either.There is no restaurants around the hotel unless you call KFC and McDonalds food.The plug in the bath does not fit properly, when you take a bath you need to keep the tap on to compensate for all the water that leaks awayYou have to dial a long number to call reception(which never worked) most normal hotels allow you to just press the 0 button.If you would like to bring someone into your room then the charge is 27 Rubles, which is a little too much, especially if you do it regularlyI left the hotel because I was unhappy with waking up in the morning with no decent food available,

I took the standard single and the rooms are spacious and comfortable with a deskThe bed was pretty comfortable.The bathroom was pleasant and hot water was plentifulThe cleaning lady was very niceThe lobby was spaciousThere is a coffee shop serving good coffee(opens rarely though)The elevators are fastThe staff are mostly goodThey played some good music from the 1980's in the foyer(The Cure for example) which was a pleasant and welcome surprise.The hotel was within spitting distance from Pushkinskaya MetroThe Wifi was good",positive
"Nice people, nice breakfast and very nice room.  Next time I'll be in Brussels I'll definitely stay with them again.",positive

A very comfortable stay at this farmhouse! Great location in the Bastogne countryside if you're planning to visit the nearby war museums. Wonderful host who is very knowledgeable about the history and area.",positive

Nice and friendly staff",negative
"Can’t call reception from the room !! What a horror, it’s 3 stars HOTEL not apartmentYou have to walk stairs UP to get to hotel. So if you are with luggage’s you MUST arrive by taxi otherwise you have to make a horror CrossFit with your heavy luggage’s Lighting in the floor and room is pretty weak. Don’t like that6th floor bear lift was not lighting at all what is NOT acceptable in 3 star hotel Over all if I am in Minsk again I will come here again and will recommend it to my friends.Have stayed in Yubileyniy hotel which is 10-15 usd more expensive and is not worth at all compare to Orbita,

THE BEST CHOICE FOR MINSKMINUTES FROM METRO Quiet room with not a bad view Hot a cold water 24 hours on your floorI booked single room for 32 USD and it’s good value for money Room was warm with hot battery so you can dry fast your underwear / socksStuff helped me with luggage’s . Thanks for thatHas a BATH , which is nice to enjoy",positive

"This property is outside of Bastogne, so it was a little difficult to access. We rented bikes and it was about 20 minutes (hilly) ride to Bastogne,

Quiet, clean, and spacious room. Mark was a wonderful host with lots of good information about the area. He gave great suggestions for what to see and do in Bastogne",positive

"Highly recommended Lovely place, helpful landlord will use it again during our next visit,

Brussels town centre,  battlefield of Waterloo,  Atomium",positive
"If you have to be in the center of Brussels, but you don't have a car it's rather inconvenient. But if you have a car and if you like the countryside, this is a good place to stay,

very nice B&B managed like a family business",positive
"The pillows were really bad and uncomfortable, and sadly so, the beds as well. Little to hard for our preference.
Checking in was a little unusual.. the reception was closed so you had to call a number after 4 o clock, so basically you checked yourself in. And no staff around for 2 days.
Not much for customer service. ,

The location of the apartment was central and right next to the beach.
A spacious apartment with plenty of room for 4 people.
Nice view, design and clean flat.",positive
"We couldn’t stay there long enough!,

Perfectly beautiful location for history of the area. Loved the country setting and quiet! It was especially nice to breakfast with the other guests and share travel experiences. Our host was a wealth of knowledge of the historical house he’d restored, WWII history of the area & went out of his way to locate a relative’s  name in his huge book of WWII cemeteries, despite the limited knowledge on our part. Marc’s B & B is a gem & definitely worth a visit!",positive
"The owner of the hotel was rude and the overall cleanliness of the room we were allocated was disgusting. The carpet was stained, the window was broken and taped up and the dust had been there for ages. The TV didn't work and the room was remotely like anything I had seen when looking for accommodation, we requested a different room he said he didn't have any. He informed me I had booked a double and that was what he gave me. He was then told that I had asked for double or a twin but certainly not a dirty room.  He said there was nothing he could do, he didn't have rooms like those advertised that was just booking.com making things up to get more people in. He eventually moved us to one of those rooms but it was still dirty with mould inside the cabinet in the bathroom and towels you could shoot peas through.  There were glass rings on the furniture which was covered in dust and the state of the radiators was sickening. I took a video or the first room and a couple of photos of the second room. We lived out of our suitcases for the 4 days & we were there on our own there were no other guests.I wouldn't recommend this dirty hotel run by a very rude owner/manager to anyone!,

the only good thing to say about this hotel was the location.",negative

Excellent breakfast",positive
"Shower and toilet are together in one little room so that take some getting used to.,

Restaurant and backery attached to the property are great and the staff are really helpful and friendly. Room was nice and large and perfect for the four of us, although the double bed in the loft is a little small so one of my kids decided to sleep on the couch.",positive
"We wanted to learn more about the history of the area and visit the museum and sites from WWII.  Marc was extremely knowledeable and provided a personal experience for our family.  I highly recommend anyone interested in learning about history, the area and the culture to stay here.  It was one of our most favorite memories of our trip.",positive

Marc has very good knowledge of battle of the bulge history and locations. He ate breakfast with the guests and told us where to go to see an important strategic breakthrough point that my father partook in. Very comfortable rooms in a country home. Very quiet.,positive
Great Hotel in excellent location...Check in staff very Helpful & friendly...Clean rooms & comfy Bed! Breakfast’ buffet in lovely room also...,positive
We were very happy about the standard of this hotel and we are definitely going to come back!,positive

Clean well sized (+dog friendly) room with patio area. Good bath and a well stocked bar. Fantastic location with endless forest to explore.,positive
"Apartment is not well thought and lacks comfort due to pretentiousness for the contemporary style. Toilet is in the first and shower on the second floor. Imagine you need to use a toilet at night. You can hardly fit in the shower cabin.Sofa has stains from previous visits, apartment rules foils are all greasy, blankets have some hair on it.I am absolutely not happy with this offering, maximum price is 100€ per night.,

The receptionist was very nice, although the property reception was closed by the time we arrived, he showed up right in 5 minutes after the call",negative
"Nice B&B in the country, but still close to town.  We had two rooms, very nice and private.  Marc was a great host, always asking if we needed anything, he even swapped foreign money with my wife as they both collect money from around the world.  Breakfast was nice. We even loved visiting the cows across the street.",positive

Location spot on",positive
"Lovely hotel highly recommended.,

"Great breakfast, comfortable bed, very close to Waterloo battlefield,  friendly hosts",positive
Love the Arboretum next door; great after-breakfast hikes before heading into the City.,positive
"Poor sound isolation. Reserved a duplex but got a loft (open spaces). My daughter need to sleep in the living room but light went through since windows don't have curtains!! Stayed 5 days and the apartment wasn't clean, not even once! No complete toylet. There's no lavatory on the ground floor. ,

Good location, nice decorated apartment. Good breakfast but needed to ask since wasn't included in the price and the suggestion of the owner was to have it ""à la carte"", what will make it quite more expensive.",negative
"This is a very cute Bed & Breakfast a few minutes from downtown and all the attractions in Bastogne.  The Innkeeper, Marcus, is an amazing person, very knowledgeable about the WWII history and friendly.  His attention to every detail is outstanding.  He breakfast was so fresh and yummy!  He’ll even recommend great places to visit and eat...not to mention discounts for them, which you can’t get anywhere.  Definitely bringing my wife for a romantic getaway...",positive

Delicious breakfast and friendly service.,positive
"Nothing particularly,

Clean, comfortable, kettle to make tea and minibar as a small fridge.Next to Underground system.Good arrangements from late Soviet period, like Izmailovo tourist centre in Moscow.Very good price.Buffet in the morning is a good option",positive
"Building works right outside the apartment, some of which was down to the owners who decided to erect a sculpture on the patio whilst we were there, using angle grinders, buzz saws etc. This wrecked our sleep one morning and was v loud. Took a whole day. Frying pans unusable due to age, dishwasher left dishes dirty. Ground floor patio not really useable as on a main road and used as a cut by members of public. This was apartment 0.1. Maybe the others different. No views from this apartment, but we should have checked that ourselves. V noisy due to being right on the street and near major building works. First floor or second would have been better. More towels needed as you go there for the beach. ,

Parking right there (essential in summer! ) friendly staff, though we never saw them in 4 days, which I guess was good. V close to beach.",positive
Marc was a wonderful host. He’s extremely knowledgeable about the area and the history of Bastogne. He provided us with tour information that was very helpful. The breakfast was delicious and the rooms and beds were very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!,positive
Very good location and value for money. Breakfast was good continental one !,positive
"When you leave the hotel through the  street door (not a revolving door), there is a small step down to street level, maybe four cm, which NEARLY made me fall. This needs to be fixed somehow.,

Efficient, friendly Spanish and Belgian  staff. Good breakfast buffet. Location perfect for EU stuff. Close to metro and banks.",positive
"The only things I would say was that you have to take your bedding and clean the property, be prepared and it’s not a problem no complaining for what we paid and what good location was.,

Good location, value for money, nice space , quiet area, nice lady owner very polite, I recommend this place and for sure I will book again for my next time visit to plopsaland Thanks",positive
The B&B is simply perfect! The location is great and the B&B itself is nice and cozy. Anne is a great host and provides an extremely delicious breakfast.,positive

The property was really cosy and nice and in a great location, quiet but close to things. Anna was extremely helpful and the food she put on was varied and of good quality.",positive
"TV can be newer.,

Very clean room.Nice soft Bed.Good Wi-fi.",positive
"Had to drive to nearest eating establishments.,

Marc was an excellent knowledgable host. Plenty of information about local sightseeing, especially WW2 Bastogne related stuff.",positive
"There are about 6 chalet style rooms to the rear of the hotel and we had one of those. Decor and facilities I would best describe as basic. Towels extremely thin. Rooms may be better in the main hotel.,

The location cannot be faulted, a few paces away from the main square. Free parking available about 10 minutes from the hotel on the road after Menin Gate which is called Leopold III Lan. Breakfast was OK. As I think others have stated it's a bit more like a B & B than a hotel. Door is locked by 10.00, and once much earlier, so you have to access with a code, which is not a problem. Ypres has very good restaurants and bars and the In Flanders Fields museum is excellent.",negative
"Staff is amazing and breakfast very good. Although the hotel has private parking, you can park in front of the hotel for  13.5 euros / day, Sunday is free.",positive
"Excellent for cycling between Oostende and Brugge, the style of the house",positive
"The only draw back was the lovely church near by that played a tune and the bells rang every half hour ,

The staff were friendly and helpful. The room large and comfortable and the spa bath to die for",positive
"There was nothing we disliked.,

Lovely B & B in a quiet pretty area of the city within walking distance of all attractions.  Anna the host was very welcoming and helpful.  Very nice continental breakfast with freshly squeezed orange juice.",positive
"In one room it was quite chilly, maybe windows need some sealing. And cleaners should pay a better attention to the bathrooms - some mold was seen between the tiles.,

Rooms itself were quite spacious and clean. Staff very friendly. Breakfast was good: we could choose from eggs to some meat cutlets or pancakes. Hotel is at good location, easy to access all parts of the city from there by car or by metro, which station is only few minutes away.",positive

The host is very welcomeing, and it is very careful at details. This B&B is one of the best I have ever seen. Good breakfast in calm and relaxing atmosphere.",positive
"We booked the double room with spa bath specifically because of the spa bath. We went above budget for this specific luxury. However when I was about to enjoy this spa bath, the lightning as well as the different functions weren’t working properly. Then when I used the double function, a lot of dirt came out of the tiny holes and all of a sudden I sat between what looked like pieces of old dirt. We asked the staff to come have a look and they did, but the language barrier made it impossible to work it out, so no spa bath luxury that we looked so much forward to. Afterwards the bath came ‘alive’ (accompanied with an awful smell and a lot of noice) on it’s own twice (!) ones in the middle of the night and ones in the morning. Would’ve of liked to see this differently obviously. Slightly dissapointed as you may understand. ,

The staff is very friendly, the hotel is modern and very very clean (this was a big big plus overall except for the spa bath!). Looks brand new even though I think isn’t. Really liked the big bed and room. Location is also a plus! Good wifi connection.",negative
"Very quiet location, 5min Walk to the Burg. Opposite a lovely church that is well worth a look round inside !! 
Great selection of food on offer at breakfast and hosted very well by Anna. Would look to stay again.",positive
"the rooms had a strange smell, like old carpets,

nothing specially",positive
"Nothing ,

Very friendly staff, very flexible for breakfast and excellent beers. The garden behind the house is wonderful and great for little children.",positive
"Maybe staying here is not the best alternative for travellers without a car. It is not easy to reach with public transport. The hosts however helped as much as possible with getting to Bruges.,

The hosts were extremely helpful, kind and friendly. Breakfast was excellent and the atmosphere in the breakfast room was just wonderful.The room was spacious and modern, bed was very comfortable. Very calm, quiet and peaceful stay.Good restaurant just across the street.",positive

Nice bar downstairs, v friendly and helpful staff.",negative

"If the buffet breakfast is less expensive, I would have opted for it.,

The ladies at the reception were very helpful.",positive
"We would have liked tea/coffee making facilities within our room, but this wasn’t important as they wereavailable in the Lounge/Dining area.,

The location was quiet and peaceful yet close to all amenities.  Our room was very comfortable and clean.We were able to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful countryside.",positive
"-,

Lovely house with charming details, in a very peaceful and relaxing setting. Quick and easy to get to Bruges by car. Room was spacious and comfortable with a lovely terrace overlooking the field and with lovely sunset views. Great shower. Tasty breakfast and welcoming hosts who gave us a lot of great recommendations for things to see. Would definitely stay there again.",positive
"All was ok, just good to know: every guest receives a message a few days before your stay that says 'Check in is 3 PM', while the hotel means check in FROM 3 PM (so only if you want to check in before 3 PM you pay 10 euro extra). Beware there is no elevator in this hotel, while it has four floors (rooms 9-12 are on the 4th floor).,

Room 12 on 4th floor was comfortable. Staff very friendly. Good location between metro Brouckere and Rogier, not far from the North station. Nice art deco elements in reception/breakfast area.",negative
"I loved this B and B! We were very warmly welcomed! The location is great slightly off the beaten track so not touristy as other parts of Bruges are. We left out car at the free car park at Coisseaukaai and caught the shuttle bus to Anna's. The room was quite hot on the top floor but by opening a window it soon cooled down. The Vlissinghe pub nearby is very atmospheric and does great  beers. Central Bruges is a short walk away.,

See above.",positive
"Staff should smile more...…..,

Clean property, good value, good location near metro....",positive
"We liked everything :) The house is in a very quiet small village by the canal and it it very cosy, with this oldfashoned charme. Hosts are lovely, warm couple that you can see are running this place with love and devotion. They are there for any request or help you might need. The dining room is nice and intimate with classical music during breakfast( breakfast is really ok, not so much variety, but one does not need more for breakfast anyway) The room itself is spatious, Beds are comfortable. Room also has a very personal touch with some nice details. Location is very good if you like being outside of busy urban areas. Brugge and Ostende are both 15 min drive by car, so it is also conviniant for city hopping. The car parking is available on the street in front of a building, and there is also a restaurant just accros the street( which we did not have time to visit). Also one info... they could not accept our credit cards for payment, so we had to pay in cash ( it might be important to someone)",positive
"A little noisy at night and in the morning when the trash collectors pick up rubbish. Narrow staircases, but at least on the way up, if you need assistance, you can be helped.,

Fantastic location to Grand Place, De Brouckere and Rogier with all means of transportation around. Even Garde du Nord is merely 10 min walk away.Super friendly receptionist.Quality breakfast.",positive
"Nothing as of dislike but could have been better, if a dustbin has been provided in the main room too, otherwise one has to walk into the washroom every time to reach the dustbin,

The place is beautiful and tranquil.",positive
Clean and safe place. 3 nights single occupancy for 165$ without breakfast for 2 person. Close to subway so you cans get any place you want. Supermarket is just on its right. Bar with a cute lady working there. Cleaning service is everyday. So I can advice that place for business trip or for staying 4-7 days.,positive
Extremely warm welcome.  The property was located in a quiet area not far from the E40 for our onward journey to the Channel Tunnel.  Fantastic breakfast,positive
"Excellent location, and very interesting hotel in old building that is completely renovated.",positive
"There is only a curtain between the bedroom and bathroom in the room we stayed in which didn’t offer much toilet privacy.,

Anne was lovely and helped us map out the main attractions and routes around bruges. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was lovely, freshly made pastries, fruits, cheeses etc every day. The location was great, about a 10 minute walk to the centre but in a very quiet little square.",positive
What was of importance for me was the location just at a metro station (Pushkinskaya metro).,positive
"Had to go to other hotel for breakfast. Not a real problem but when I arrived, I had no idea where to go. Maybe make sure there is a sign or something. The breakfast itself was very good though. ,

Very friendly staff and Herentals is a very nice city. I could use a garagebox because the morning after my stay there was a market. Diner in the Hotels restaurant was also very nice.",positive
"nothing, everything was perfect, the access to the room is a bit complicated, but I am guessing it is to isolate the rooms from the noise from the hotel's event venues.,

everything was very good, but the breakfast was excellent, and the staff was also very nice !",positive
"Kitchen and lounge a little cramped for a large group when receiving visitors with us but it was manageable. Some confusion about charges for bed linen and towels. Booking.com details showed these items as paid for but rental company wanted separate charge for these from us. Couldn't find remote control for the TV.,

Easy entrance, good quiet location by canal but still close to main square. Good number of bathrooms (3). Lots of information left in house for things to do. Good value.",positive

"Very nice lady at reception.
Great bar with fabulous belgium beers !",positive
All good.,positive
"Nothing,

That it had everything and more that we could need. Enough places for 9 of us to sit and eat at a table. The children loved the tablet tennis table and the football table. They also really enjoyed the garden with swing slid and big enough to play football",positive
"Room was not serviced daily.,

Hosts were very friendly and welcoming. They accommodated our needs for an earlier breakfast serving which was much appreciated. Very comfortable stay. A very good restaurant is directly across the street from the B&B. We ate there two nights in a row.",positive
"We had an issue with the power blowing in the evening. I call the owner who doesn't live on site and they arrive in approx 15 mins & switched back on but unfortunately the heating did not reset and room was cold. When I mentioned to the owner he said I should of turned the bathroom heater on, but this was on a timer and could not be felt in the bedroom.,

Owners friendly and happy to help with most things. Perfectly situated",negative

Very good location, good value for money, friendly staff",negative

location is very good in the center of the city 
the owner is very kind
breakfast was good",positive
"The breakfast was too expensive compared to the hotel price and local price level (18.50 Belorussian roubles, or about 7.50 €), which did not reflect in quality and choice, although there was both hot and cold food + freshly brewed coffee, etc. Still, paying 30% of the room rate for breakfast is not good (you wouldn't pay 30 € for breakfast at 90 € per night hotel, right?). No air conditioning in the rooms, although the temperatures may reach +30 C even in September. The business centre (printing, copying, etc) was closed on week-end, although, looking at the Minsk visitors' profile, big part of them are people on business trips.,

1980's Soviet era luxury hotel for foreign tourists (renovated in 1996). Glimpse into that era, with touch of contemporary amenities, like super good WiFi. Large room (though little bit noisy, as the hotel is located on crossing of two 8-lane streets), but still OK. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is superb: just 50 metres to Pushkina metro station from where you can reach the centre in 10 minutes (3 stops) for 0.30 € per ride :). Lots of eateries in 50 metres distance, including Burger King, McDonalds and local 'shaurma' (chicken). You can also order food delivery from different places via the Internet, payment by card or cash. Supermarket 100 metres to the other side from the hotel. Good room service and cleaning. Overall - probably one of the best places to stay in Minsk (not taking into account the missing AC).",positive
"It’s a bit old and have specific smell.,

Very big rooms and very clean!",positive
"Limited restaurant options around the hotel location on weekends.,

Comfortable bed, quiet room, big bathroom. Very well connected region.",positive

It was all good. Location is central and convenient for shops etc but it is in a very quiet street which we appreciated.",positive
"We had a very nice stay at this quiet, friendly, cosy little accommodation!Thank you for the special service!",positive
Very good breakfast,positive
"Lighting in the room could be better. A lamp for working at the desk would be a useful addition as the room lighting is not very bright, although perfectly adequate if you don't need to work or search in the depths of your luggage! ,

Very quiet surroundings (but only 50m from the main pedestrian shopping area), great shower, comfy bed, friendly staff, small hotel with character. 10 minutes stroll to the Grand Place.",positive
"The spiral staircase was not made clear Pre-booking (I don't think). Anyone with any mobility issues would find it either impossible or very difficult.,

Breakfast = Excellent, Location = Ideal.The hospitality of the host Anne.",positive

Good location
Comfortable room",positive
"The linen wasn't clean. After I've noticed it on reception, they changed it. Still, the impression is not the best. Also, sound isolation was very bad, so I've heard my neighbors.,

The location is great, it is just in the city center. The staff is friendly and responsive.",negative

The staff spoke English and were very helpful in getting me around Minsk.",positive
"Pillows were not good; very lumpy.  Bed only reasonably comfortable. (There is a sort of rubber sheet under the sheets.  Not nice to sleep on. Breakfast okay but only buffet.  No a la carte (ie fried eggs) available.,

Friendly greeting upon check in. Comfortable room. Restaurant pretty good.",positive
"Nothing it was great for us as we were cycling. Some may find it a bit rural though.,

Fantastic space with seating area, lovely touches like free drink on arrival and tea and coffee making facilities. Great breakfast that was best value we had in Belgium. Host lovely.",positive
"The main entrance door was under reconstruction.,

Nice and helpfull staff, excelent breakfast.",positive
"The B&B is located in what feels like a wonderfully hidden corner of true Flanders (even though the entry to the highway is close) -  located alongside the canal between Ostend and Bruges, great for walking or biking,  and with views on fields and sheep from the bedroom window.The house itself is also interesting -  while the house has been re-organized for B&B purposes, historical and personal touches remain, including art.  The breakfast, served in the former living/dining room of the house, is a real treat; the hosts are friendly and service-oriented, and yes, everything is very clean.   We loved our stay there, and recommend it highly.",positive
A great location.,positive
"The fridge was broken. There is no lift (I knew that) so if you have large luggage ask for lower floor.,

Nice renovated modern room, spacious bathroom with shower. The bed was really comfortable.",positive
"Nil,

Anne is a lovely host. Her breakfast is fresh,  with a great variety of mueslis, yoghurts, cereal, cold cuts, breads and preserves; delicious coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. 
Our room was on the first floor so the narrow winding stair case was easy for us. 
We stayed on the hottest day (37°c)  of the year. And although there is no air conditioning, the room was cooled down with a fan and the big windows open. 
Our bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was massive!!  
Location is excellent. A short stroll over the canal and you're in the centre of old town, but far enough away to feel like you are a local rather than a tourist. 
If I ever return to Brugge I would stay here in a heart-beat. Highly recommend.",positive
Really cheap comparing to others and with good location and very very clean hotel...recommended,positive
"Stayed on the ground floor, and could hear a bit the noise from the other rooms, especially from the room above.,

Very good location, with the supermarket, cafés, banks round the corner, and close to the sea and the coastal tram stop. Very nice owners, pleasant room, pretty patio. Kettle, microwave and cutlery put at the guests' disposal.",positive
"The room had the toilet isolated from the bath -  it was strange to cross to the other door just to was your hands.,

The dinner was amazing, they have a pub aside where you can go for a beer after dinner and find very nice people. The deck is good place when summer arrives, or if you want to smoke without noise.",positive
"The only thing we did not find acceptable was the electric cooker, the heating elements took way to long to heat up to cook food...,

the house was fine, suited our needs..   We enjoyed our stay, and the house was cozy..",positive
"-,

The accommodation is just so lovely and cozy - and we loved the surroundings! Two ponds are around the house and plenty of green wherever you look. In the neighbourhood you can find horses, donkeys and cows - make sure you discover the surroundings by walking or cycling. We had a truly pleasant stay - the bed was really comfortable and the place is perfect to spend some time inside the warm house while it's cold outside. On sunny days, you can enjoy a beautiful view and have breakfast outside. Speaking about breakfast: we ordered that in advance and we had a very delicious, rich breakfast and spent a perfect morning there!Birgit, the owner was really lovely and very responsive - our weekend trip to Logies De Meerkoet was truly memorable. We will definitely come back - thanks for everything, Birgit!",positive
"Relatively lack of illumination in the room,

An absolutely good and crystal clear hotel at a calm location, close to public transport.",positive
Good location for people with cars so that you can have easier travel in and out of Brugge. Not a good location to visit Brugge if you're a quick Traveller with bags as you have to take a bus.,positive
"Narrow staircase,

Comfortable rooms and very clean",positive
"It is not a real minus just more variety on the food menu would be cool. But the kitchen facilities might not be equipped for more. ,

Very nice owner lead hotel in original Art Deco style. Rooms are surprisingly luxurious and well done in detail. Good located between two major Metro stations and close to Gare du North. Plenty of shopping possibilities around. Breakfast looked great, but I did not had one. Amazing place to come back to.",positive
"The 2nd time at Anna's and it was wonderful. The room is spacious, the breakfast very lovely and the hospitality shown by Anne just wonderful. Anne got in contact prior the arrival day and send us recommendations for the parking. She greeted us and explained the B&B and the surroundings. The room is wonderful, we had the room with twin bed option, and the bathroom is huge. The breakfast is delicious, fresh cut fruits, a delicious selection of cheese and ham / sausage and different cereals. Anne offered fresh orange juice which was very refreshing. The location is perfect - a 5 minutes walking distance to the old town. Close to shops, restaurants and bars. Just the perfect getaway!",positive

Very good host and excellent breakfast. Nice experience,positive
"Check wasn't until 16.00 hrs and there is no access to the Hotel before this time so, if you arrive and wish to drop your baggage there for safe keeping, this is not possible!There is no lift and the Staircase is not very wide with Marble steps and, there is no Handrail on the outside which makes carrying luggage up the staircase quite precarious, could be a serious problem for older or less able visitors!,

Breakfast was good and varied, the location was very convenient for sightseeing and the Menin Gate.",positive
"The toilet smell of cigarettes and there was bits of cigarette ash on the ground, plus the ventilation didnt work at the toilet so the smell really didnt go away. The bathroom and everything else was spotless clean though. I didnt confront the staff about this matter as I stayed for one night only, but Im pretty sure they would offer a solution. It's just weird that the housekeeping would mark this room as a clean one, the smell was really strong.,

Entrance to the hotel is through a nice lobby bar with brilliant atmosphere. The room is cosy, bed soft, but comfortable. Staff was helpful altough I didnt bother them with any requests during my one night stay.",positive
"The mattress of the bed is so light that it moves and the wooden steps to our first-floor room is steep, which make luggage carrying difficult.,

We like the elegantly decorated interior of the B & B. We particularly enjoyed the wonderful breakfast and the bathtub.",positive
"Bathroom - water was leaking from sealing. No family rooms were available in this hotel.,

Close to subway station, easy to reach the city centre. Very helpful staff at reception - rearranged bookings so we can stay for another night in the same rooms.",positive
"We just missed the 'doudou' festival ;),

Excellent breakfast. Excellent location. Spacious and comfortable bathroom. Friendly hosts.",positive
"We were 8 and would have liked a place to play cards or drink a tea before going to bed. During summer there is a nice place outside but during winter this does not fit.,

Warm welcome and great choice for breakfast with fresh fruit salad and boiled eggs, several types of bread. Comfortable beds and nice warm shower.",positive
Could add a small menu for Vegan Breakfast as well and indicate explicitly for ease of identifying.,positive
"The beds are a bit small. A curtain in the bathroom would be great. And the house could have been a bit cleaner, there where a lot of cobwebs everywhere.,

the propety was perfectly located for us, close to family and the beach (45min drive). The house and garden are specious, also very great that they allow pets. The house is located in a small street, so there is no traffic noise.",negative
"Poor Wi-fi (very slow) for an hotel in EU district.,

Good breakfast in nice room.   Great location for EU district.  Quiet street.",positive
"Unfortunately property was unable to accept payment by credit card.  Lots of mosquitoes in the room.,

Good choice for breakfast, quality ingredients.  Good size family room.  Accomodating and friendly host.",positive
Parking not directly at hotel because of street building works - also made hotel a bit hard to find - presumably only a temporary problem,positive

Good location and clean room.",positive

"N/A!,

Anne was extremely friendly and welcoming; she even bought my wife a cake on her birthday! The location was perfect- walking distance to the centre and the property was always clean and “home-y”
Would definitely come back!",positive
"far from the town and to be fair beds could be softer but still fine.,

location is abit far from the city center even though metro station is nearby. so it takes some time to go the town but yet for this price it is a very good hotel. especially recepcionist ladies they were all so helpful and spent hours to book us train tickets and answer all our questions about the city and directions.",positive
"The owners spoke excellent English and were warm, friendly and inviting.  Breakfast was very good.  The room allocated was large, comfortable and full of character.  I would use this B&B again in any future business trip to Mons.",positive

breakfast was nice - location was good",positive
"Charming, cozy and welcoming home from the moment we pulled in the driveway (both garden outside and the home itself). Excellent escape from the city and spacious for a family but only 30min drive and easy parking into Bruges.",positive
"Room windows are thin, so could hear road construction noise through.
Breakfast has very limited options. On a table was a card sign 'to order fresh egg option, sausages etc', but when asking for it the waitress said to fetch sausages and bacon from the buffet, also chef made a 'poached egg', which was just messed up strings of egg white and hard boiled egg yolk... So please stick to the buffet. ,

Lovely staff, especially a Reception Trainee man (guess French/Belgian one).
Lovely touch to have a complimentary mini bar with water/juice/coke and nespresso coffee. 
Good, soft bed. Clean crispy bedsheets. 
Good location next to metro station.",positive
"Right near the main square...parking is by machine till 6pm then free till 8am....not hard to find past the ww1 gate memorial...,

WiFi worked well enough....breakfast adequate....no tea coffee facilities in room....want evening meal try the ypres burger bar ....really nice burgers....almost everyone happy to talk English....all in all ...great ...paid my respect's to those who didn't return after the ww1...",positive
"For this to be a regarded as a business hotel (which may or may not be its emphasis... I travelled for business, so I noticed it), a few minor changes would make a big difference:- A complementary bottle of water in the room is a minor expense, but would be a very welcoming gesture.- Available power plugs for charging laptops and / or mobile phones; I had to look for one, and eventually I had to unplug a bedside lamp- Do not disturb / please service my room signs for the doors. Again: minor, but could potentially avoid embarrassing run-ins with housekeeping.,

The staff, and especially the manager, were extremely friendly and helpful. The building is beautiful (both interior and exterior), with authentic decor downstairs in the tavern and a modern, sleek feel to the rooms. The location is great (very close to major sights and transportation links), and I found the hotel clean, neat, and a pleasurable stay overall. Having a light dinner and a drink at the tavern downstairs is a MUST; the Croque Madame is excellent!",positive
"All was good. Very nice, clean and friendly.",positive
"Hotel is too old. It's cold 3 stars hotel but it is as 1 star hotel. In entrance there is no bellboy to help your baggage. Inside of the room is too cold and too old furniture and bad. Also, when i asked some questions to reception about address registration she just told that she doesn't know it and than i asked from her to ask her manager for information and she told me that today just i work and i don't know anything about it. I do not recommend to anyone to stay there.,

This hotel is very close to metro. Also around the hotel some supermarkets and restaurants. Not in center but easy to get go everywhere.",negative
"Everything was just perfect!,

1. The owners are great, always smiling, full of energy and they make you feel very welcome. 
2. The location is perfect: close to the train station and very close to the centre of Mons, in a very quiet area, on a narrow cobbled street.
3. The house is absolutely marvellous. The decor is vintage and elegant. The bathroom is astonishing, really stylish and special. The bed is comfortable, equipped with clean, high quality linen. 
4. The place is crystal clean. 
5. The breakfast was one of the best because it had lots of options, all of which were of extremely high quality (jams, cheese, cake, chocolate, butter, milk, yogurt, cereals, different types of bread, honey, coffee, orange and lemon juice, fruits).
Thank you for making our stay in Mons one we will never forget. ❤",positive

"Very disappointed to have been disturbed by noise next door, asked to be moved to a quieter place away from a kids football team. the next night, having to wake up at 5.50am i couldn’t sleep because of what sounded like a ""party"" between two men and woman going on. Decided to get up and just check out at 1am because of it. went down to reception fully dressed and ready to just leave, i was given the keys to another room in a more quiet place in the hotel. i really was not happy about any of this, while feeling unwell from a stomach bug i'd picked up. I have stayed in this hotel many times since 2012 and something always happens there. they really need to step up their game.,

Is there anything to like here apart from a warm room.",negative
"Everything excellent but stairs up to 2nd floor.,

BREAKFAST GREAT!!!",positive
"There were  issues of privacy.  The on- suite toilette has been separated by  just a curtain rather than by a  proper door from our bedroom making it uncomfortable to use the bathroom (the other person had to leave the room to save both partners from the embarrassment). Furthermore, the window of the room  overlooked a public area just arms-length from where other guests were socialising or passing by. This was also uncomfortable as  the window had to be kept open due to high temperature in the room, so we felt quite exposed to the traffic by other guests. Considering these conditions and that breakfast was not included in the price I don't think it was a good value for money.,

Water from the faucets and shower head is really bad ""half the holes are blocked and the water current is irregular""
One small shower gel and shampoo not enough for a full bath.
Soap is too much small, and will finish in 5 uses or so
The room:
Tv is old box from the 90s
Not properly fixed power outlets
Old walls
No sound isolation couldn't sleeo at night from the loud voices next door and their fights
No AC or temperature regulator. Theu fix the temperature till you boil alive and thats it, opening the windows it's too much loud

Location was perfect, hotel was clean and comfortable and the service was great. I highly recommend this hotel, especially if you want to visit EU institutions.",positive
"My room was up two flights of stairs. I struggled to safely get my luggage up and had to leave my case in my dad’s room as I couldn’t manage it. There is one staircase which is marble and open to the side and this made carrying hard. There was no offer of help. We were first to check in but their response was simply tough, all rooms were allocated, but at breakfast the following morning most were occupied by younger men.,

Father’s room was ground floor",negative
Room service only till 22:00,positive
"Arriving by car is a challenge! There is a bus station in front and NO car access. There are also serious roadworks going on at the moment. We found a corner to stop at for a few minutes and went to ask in hotel what to do. 
They have an agreement for good prices (well 9€) with nearby Parking Leopold so it is worth heading there from the start instead of trying to park anywhere on a street corner! It is only a couple of hundred metres away. You swap ticket out in hotel for special price one.
But be warned - the roadworks make that carpark very difficult to get into - we had a 2.5km detour to get there from just 200m the other side of bus station! 
And the condition of that carpark’s foot entrance is a disgrace! There is no lighting on a pitch black graffiti filled, urine smelling corridor. Had to use gsm torch to even find the lift! Glad I was not alone there! I intend to report it’s state to local council - carpark owner (not the hotel’s!) should not be allowed to charge the high prices they do with such bad facilities! 
That said - the hotel itself works hard to make your stay pleasant - let’s hope the car park improves once the road works are done!,

After the ordeal of parking - see below - I was unsure what to expect! The retained faux-marbre original entrance - while classic for it’s time gives an odd impression with it’s dull brown tones - but I respect the owners desire to keep some original features! Reception is upstairs by a tiny old lift. The reception is manned by super friendly and helpful guys. You feel they want to help lake your stay pleasant. The rooms are fine - just like many standard hotel rooms in any modern built hotel. The soundproofing windows - about 15cm wide double glazing sound-proofing work well. It was quiet. The view was obscured by the use of smoke glass - but better so - it was to ugly rear views of nearby buildings. 
Everything in the room was clean and fresh and there was even an empty minifridge in it.
The huge plus of the hotel is it’s location providing you arrive by train - it is right next to the station! 
Breakfast was also good - with bacon and two sorts of egg - scrambled or boiled to your choice of hardness. Plus all usual breakfast fare.
All was clean - TV had only one adult and one children’s dutch channel and no subtitles which was no use to my Flemish hearing impaired partner - but I think there were plenty of French and English channels - though I am not a tv fan anyway.
Sights of Namur were all easy walking distance. 
In fact we slept well and if we had travelled by train would have found everything fine! The car parking issue spoilt it for me! The car park has surveillance but I was a bit worried about the car safety too.
If we go again we will travel by train and likely use the hotel again. Not if we go by car though!",positive
"I didn't like that you need to ring a bell to have the door opened for you even arriving relatively early in the evening. Sometimes the front desk girl is busy doing another thing and you need to wait out in the cold until she decides to pay attention to you and open the door. I think that a mechanism where you use your room key to open the door might not be difficult to implement.,

I selected the hotel based on the location, close to museums. It was excellent!! The two main museums are at short walk distance. There are good places to have good and cheaper breakfast nearbuy, just a few blocks from the museums.",positive
"This is not the good part of town since it is next to the train station and doesnt feel very safe at night.,

The room was clean and beds are comfortable. The rooms are very quiet so dont worry that it is just across the street from the main train station. They have a reduce parking ticket of 60% off, so.make sure to buy it in the lobby.",positive
"Wi-fi speed was a bit disappointing. Would have preferred rectangular rather than square pillows.,

Lovely bright room on the 7th floor. Spotlessly clean and with crisp fresh sheets. Free to use mini-bar (but with limited contents).",positive

Good breakfast, facilities met my expectations. Good location. Public parking easy.",negative

"Super friendly staff and excellent location :) . Even though is located in front of the train station, it is very quiet.",positive
"Nothing,

I only stayed overnight having been in a different and much more expensive Brussels Hotel the previous night.  This hotel was better in every respect at a much lower price.  I think the location may well be the answer.  Closely located to the EU Commission that is usually closed over the weekend, the hotel needs to sell rooms -- Take advantage of that.  You will not be sorry.",positive
"Better CCTV as I was robbed outside,

Location",positive
Towels,positive
"Only that we didnt  see the instructions for the calefaction in the room (the instructions were in de living of the acomodation) ,

The staff is very very friendly and kind.
We would come back again. I van recommend this place for sure",positive

Though they chaged the room on request, i found torn old beedsheets even in changed room.,

They were quick to respond to request",negative

Big room, nice view of the citadelle, elevator, very clean, great price, air conditioning, 10 min walk to really great neighborhoods.",positive
"As in many other similar hotels in Brussels there is a narrow staircase - I did not mind it, but if you have a large suitcase and an upper floor room, have this in mind when booking,

Nice option for stay near North station and city centre, nice room that was better than similarly priced hotels I stayed nearby",positive
"Very central location ( with the car) , all kinds of possibilities to visit Belgium and Luxembourg. 
Restaurants nearby within 10 min. drive. 
Easy to step out the door and to start hiking or cycling.",positive

Friendly staff, fast WiFi, beautiful breakfast room.",positive
"The kitchen facility’s could be better there’s no oven or microwave and no bowels or bread knive but for the price you can not go wrong would recommend to anyone ,

Location excellent the room was spotless I was given a courtesy call and a text with instructions for garage parking and door code would definitely recommend and use again I get stressed out easy with parking ect and this was so easy ,the place looks amazing when you first walk in",positive
"Tried to get a hold of the hotel several times, but no answer. Very expensive to take a taxi to and from the hotel to the airport. Was told the average cost would be 25 Euros, it was instead 40 going there and 50 coming back. Would not recommend the location for that reason.,

It was a place to stay. the bed was comfortable.",negative
"The room lacks some space to open the doors and the toilet is separated from the shower (bathroom is separated in 2 different spaces),

Great reception service, the building seems renovated. You have everything needed inside a room",positive

"Customer service was poor , and they didn’t have anything at what ever  you asked they didn’t have kmt 
There was no heater and the electric heater wasn’t working properly which leave the room cold so u ended sleeping in ur jumper etc.. 
It’s good thing we were out most the night not spent the time in there ,

Location was perfect to get around the clubs and shops",negative
"Breakfast somewhat overpriced. Hotel interior a bit outdated, cleaning could be improved. ,

Very kind and helpful receptionists, a true asset. Very good sound insulation (not always the case even in high-end hotels in Belgium!). Room 308 had a good overview towards the beautiful building of the train station.",positive
"Very accomodating and helpful, private parking and very good location",positive
"extra charges if you check in early,

Good Hotel especially location wise",positive
"Sofas look a little bit dirty.,

The apartment is very large and comfortable. The bedroom is not facing the street so it is very quiet. Kitchen is well equipped and appliances are in very good status. There one tv in the living room and another one in the bedroom, big and nice. It is very well located for been working in the European commission's  Cove building.",positive
"The reception was not present at all, the cleaning service doesn't work properly, because the monitor that indicated the cleaning was broken.,

"There is no faults with this accommodation ,I will be staying here again well done....,

Every thing was spot on we will be going again next year,location wise it's perfect,one word awesome.....",positive
"WiFi signal was not consistent. This is not really an issue for us, but worth noting that the room is located on the 3rd floor. You will have to be cautious if you have a baby/toddler around (like we did), such that they do not wander too close to the stairs/edge.,

Very warm and friendly host. Claudine was wonderful. She was very welcoming towards us. Being a grandmother herself, she was very loving towards our <1 year old son. She even offered him toys to play during our stay. The room was very comfortable. In fact, the entire top floor is basically for the guest. So, you will have access to one larger room, a smaller room and the bathroom. Claudine offers freshly prepared breakfast of your choice, with bio/organic ingredients and artisanal bread. She made us omelettes every morning.Nice location, in a low density housing area close to many parks/green spaces, but close enough to the city. Would definitely recommend for those looking for a quiet getaway.",positive
"A bottle of water could have been provided, as the nearest supermarket was 10min walk away, and all shops in the area close at 6pm. No soap or shampoo either. Could've used these after a tiring journey. A microwave safe bowl would have been useful. A few chairs in the reception would have been helpful, as I had to wait for almost at hour to check in. Even though my check in time was 4pm, had to wait till 5pm in the cold weather for the office to open.,

There was a well equipped kitchen with refrigerator, microwave, electric cooktops, utensils. Good heating. There was an electric iron with an ironing table, television, good furniture. Very clean and comfortable. Daily cleaning entails a daily charge of 12 euros.",positive

The room is a bit dusty",negative
"The price was higher than expected - we had paid for only one breakfast and of course there were two of us, plus the free on-street parking was about 700m away, not 100m, so we were expected to pay €15 to stay in a multi-storey car park near the station. We took the long walk instead!Disappointed that the Cathédrale Saint-Aubain was closed off by builders' fences with no explanation. It's supposed to be one of the top attractions of Namur along with the citadel (which incidentally was difficult to find - follow signs for Terra Nova).,

Checking in was quite smooth. Nice breakfast. Friendly people in the town. Excellent food in Brasserie François at the edge of the square around the Cathédrale Saint-Aubain. We enjoyed a boat trip on the Meuse and Sambre rivers.",negative
"GPS coordinates send you via a dangerous road from the wrong site of the premises. Be sure that you approach the B&B via Battice center (first right coming from the centre square)Of course, this is not something the B&B owners can influence.,

Due to COVID-19, the number of rooms was restricted so each had their safe area to enjoy breakfast in their own bubble.Swimming pool was accessable with separate timeslots per bubbleAs usual, room meet a high standard and breakfast was delicious. The B&B setting is just beautiful with an entrance lane which can't be beaten.The location is just wonderful with Voeren, Maastricht and even the High Fens within reach. Don't forget to visit Val Dieux for a peaceful visit and joyful refreshment (beer in my case)The B&B owner was so kind to offer and book restaurant table in one of the nearby restaurants. Take-away may be considered as well.",positive
The location was amazing very handy and the parking facilities were extremely good.,positive

Location is great. 3-5 minutes from the gate, 1 minute from the ramparts. Spacious apartment. Friendly hosts.",positive
"Leaving...it was a bit emotional.,

Being able to park directly in front of the house was particularly convenient.Immediately upon arrival we were made to feel as though we stepped into our home-away-from-home.  From the spacious bedroom on a private floor (with self-serve coffee and tea), to the pristine, modern, well-equipped private full bathroom, it was obvious that great pride and attention to detail is taken to ensure comfort and create an atmosphere of friendly warmth.  During the check-in process, the proprietor inquired about our dietary preferences and offered evening restaurant recommendations which facilitated a memorable delicious dining experience.  Taking our dietary preferences into account, the variety and quality of the breakfast items, which included fresh organic options, was impressive and created an ideal start to the day.",positive
"No hanging space for suits or shirts.,

All good  and Patrick does the best 7 minute boiled eggs! :-)",positive
"Don't expect too many restaurants to be open on Sunday in the European quarter...,

When I was there more than a year ago, they promised me a free breakfast the next time I came, (because there was a problem with the hot water). They kept the promise, and it was a very nice breakfast buffet, too!",positive
"The bloody spiders and spiderwebs,

The location",negative
"- The room was very warm as there is no air con (30+ degree temperatures didn't help. But this was obviously not the hotel's fault)
- check-in wasn't until 3pm when I arrived at 11am, but they did offer for me to store luggage.
- no lift in the property
- the WiFi didn't work on the my floor (4th), only downstairs. 
- My room had a glass screen in front of the shower which has transparent glass around the edge so you can see in from the bedroom and vice versa - not great if you are sharing with someone and value your privacy. As a solo traveller I was obviously fine but worth mentioning. 
,

- The staff were very friendly and helpful. I didn't catch their names but they made me feel welcome.
- Quirky bar in reception area
- Great proximity to some of the city's best attractions and transport links.
- comfortable bed aside from the heat.
- very clean thoughout the hotel.",positive

"No shampoo, shower gel, slippers and cleaning service.",positive
"The bathroom had a floor to ceiling window so if your in the shower you can see into the bedroom and if you are in the bedroom you can see EVERYTHING about the person in the shower. Not sure if every room is like this but it makes it a bit weird when traveling with friends.,

The hotel clerk was excellent! Very helpful and even carried some of our luggage up the stairs. The building is very old and doesn’t have an elevator.",positive
"The area the hotel is in isn't great. And you should bring earplugs because it's really easy to hear people walking through the corridors. The shower was ok when I could get the right temperature but it basically had a mind of its own!,

Netflix app built into the tv and a good wifi connection. The bed was clean and very comfortable.",negative

Fabulous city centre location, secure parking. A lovely property.",positive

Everything was fantastic! Claudine was such an amazing host. Very helpful and friendly. Besides, she is a wonderful cook. She made us feel at home. The room was super clean, bed, pillows and linen extra comfy. Shower with nice warm water. The wifi was very fast. There are lots of restaurants at a 10 min walking distance.

Highly recommended!! Thank you Claudine for everything, you definitely made our stay more pleasant. Big hugs from Mexico!",positive

Very nice house! The host is a very friendly gentlemen :)The kitchen has all the stuff one needs for cooking.",positive
"Wifi speed was very, very poor only 6.1 Mbps when I tested it (see photo); This alone would make me hesitate about booking again. Room felt a little gloomy with the curtains drawn which was necessary because there was another hotel opposite who'd have been able to peer straight into your room; coffee making facilities only, no kettle or cups large enough to make a cup of tea (no milk either).,

Lovely clean room, very comfortable bed, complimentary drinks in the mini bar; coffee making facilities;",positive

Room was also nice, has everything what you may need. The private bathroom is in the separate room, clean and big.
The house is not in the center, but a metro station was not far away and there is  a direct line to the central station, so for me it was not a problem.",positive

What a wonderful house!! We stayed just one night but it was like being at home. Super nice breakfast.",positive
"The hotel is showing its age, only one lift was working during our stay. The room itself was a little dated. Breakfast was good but the hot options were limited and what was available wasn't very good.,

The bed was comfortable, NH still provides those little bottles of shampoo, shower gel, lotion, etc instead of the giant hair and body wash dispensers that you get in most hotels now. The Nespresso machine in the room was a nice touch. The breakfast spread met expectations. Also, the hotel smelled quite nice.",positive
"Cleaniness could have been betterBreakfast offering was not good. It lacked the variety, It was really expensive.Wifi speeds are not that great. Some days it didn't even work,

The location of the place is just perfect. City is very easier to accesses to.The staff speaks good English and are willing to help.The collection of keys is easier.",negative

"Charlotte went the extra mile for us and dropped us off at the bus station AT 4AM!!! She also waited for us with the AC on (we arrived during a heatwave). The rooms are extremely clean, the breakfast is rich and accommodates any need (even gluten free). The house is lovely, within 15min walk from the heart of the old city (nice evening stroll), but there is a bus station in front of the house if you choose not to walk. Visit their brewery and try all their beers, they're excellent!",positive
"We had an amazing time at cote verger. Stunning location, beautiful rooms, pool with a view and above all the warm welcome of our hosts made it a truly memorable experience.

Lovely location withing walking distance to all the main sights.",positive
"hotel location is not central; best option for transportation is a tram (stop almost in front of the hotel),  district is not fascinating; rooms are not soundproof; also was certain ventilation noise during whole night and noise in the bathroom when you switched the light on (light and ventilation was interlinked),

View from that specific room was really nice! working staff was good! rooms were clean and neat! comfort bed. toiletries and electric kettle with tea/coffee option together with cups were available,.",negative
Excellent location near train station but walking distance to historic center and other attractions. Helpful staff. Room quiet and warm though facing busy street due to two sets of double-pane glass at each window. Comfortable bed.,positive
Is nice and clean hotel,positive
"Nice, cosy, old townhouse newly renovated and located in walking distance to the ancient centre of Brugge. The guest house is a nice, quiet location where you easily can relax.  A spacious living room and terrace can be used by the guests and  antique furniture is supporting the boutique style. Very good homestyle breakfast with homemade juice and honey and delicious bread, croissant and buns from the nearby bakery. Our host Charlotte had been very caring and attentive, making us feel home right from the beginning. We really loved our stay and will surely be back in the future. Many, many thanks to Charlotte ....",positive
Quaint b&b sounded by nature.  If you want to have a relaxing visit to Belgium I highly recommend you stay at this B&B.  The owner makes you feel at home and is very attentive.  Nice pool with great view.,positive

Very close to North trainstation",negative
I have  been coming back to this hotel for the best part of 20 years....i think that  says it all. Namur is de flandre,positive
"Staff was ""moderately"" friendly and there was some leakage from the sink. But this was a minor issue.,

Small rooms, but it has everything one might need and everything was clean and worked well. Location is perfect at 5 minutes walking distance from the South - Midi train station. Price is very reasonable considering the location and the quality of the room.",negative
"The only thing that was a downside for me was that the floors and walls don't block sound out and the floorboards are creaky so we could hear the people above us but it's OK if you are a heavy sleeper or don't mind earplugs. Also the bathroom has no walls so if you're a pair of friends just set up a system!,

The B&B was so cute! Breakfast was AMAZING, Charlotte really put out a beautiful spread, you will not be left hungry! The B&B is only a 20 min walk along the canal to the main square and we felt completely safe walking back at night. The owners also own a brewery next door with locally brewed beer (Fort Lapin is even sold in stores and bars so they're really legit!). We stayed in the room with a garden view which was lovely. The common area was lovely with a coffee machine, honesty tab with Fort Lapin beers in the fridge (only €2!), and loose leaf teas.",positive
"Everything at B&B was amazing. Claudine is a great host, she took the time to talk to us since we had so many questions about Brussels and even drove us to the station. We felt at home and would definitely go back.",positive

Broken walls and furniture gave a very poor standard to the room.
Hopefully it will get fixed for the future guests. ,

The position is strategic.",negative
"The hotel is in a bit of a rough neighbourhood 
Be careful at night
Found the wi-fi kept going  down , 
There wasn’t much choice at breakfast 
And found some of the staff a bit miserable 
Don’t think I would stay here again ,

The hotel is very near to midi station , about a 5 minute walk 
My room was cleaned every day , had 3 good nights sleep",positive
"The narrow stairs to the second floor may hinder some disabled elder folks.,

It was in a residential area just out of town center, with a bus stop outside the door.  No parking worries at all!",positive

Bed not comfortable",negative
The hotel was a short walk from the bus stop for Charleroi airport though not easy to find the route. Its also very close to Lemonnier Metro station for easy access to the centre.,positive
We liked everything about it,positive
"Even though we were the only guests, the bathroom is shared with othera (in case the place is full).,

Very nice house. Very clean room. Claudine is very kind with her guests.",positive
"The cleanness of toilets ....When I did my reservation on booking, I requested a room at upper floors and not street view. I had a room at the first floor with street view ...,

The breakfast was really good and over expectation ! the location is perfect, next to the metro station. The hotel itself is very nice and elegantly furnished.",positive
Good location,positive
"It was a shame there was no lift but that's the nature of the building.  However, when on duty, Imed was happy to carry our cases for us.,

Breakfast was taken in the wonderful Art Deco bar and seating area.  It was very good and fresh.  Imed was the staff member who laid it out and he was extremely attentive.  Nothing was too much trouble for him.  In fact, my friend is a cealiac and he actually left the premises to buy some gluten-free crackers for her!",positive

"There wasn't room service available on the 25Th of December...  They have a snack fridge at the lobby though ,

All of the above plus the excellent price for the days before and at Christmas",positive
"Feels very insecure there, not clean rooms, no one in the reception, very bad smell in the rooms. I made an early check out as the rooms were bad, and mostly because of security issue, but they did not return my money. The cost does not comply with services at all. not recommended place.,

Garden was good",negative
"There is no lift, only a rather narrow staircase, so travel light if possible. The street alongside the hotel is really horrible. No bar after 10pm on Saturday night was a bit surprising.,

Entering this hotel was like stepping into a time machine. The bar area decor and furniture are practically unchanged since the 1930s. The rooms were modern and comfortable, and the staff were all very welcoming. It's 10 mins from the Grand Place and the Botanic Gardens.",positive
"Even if it is only 20 minutes walking from the town center and to Brussels nord station, the zone is a bit intimidating especially in the night. 
The AC did not work and we had two electric heaters which were not working either. ,

The bed was really comfortable, it was close to the nord station and the shower was very hot which we loves after a long cold day. Lot of comments made us think we were going to a horrible place and it is ok.",positive
"road under construction,

good location to use  public transport to airport and bussiness",positive
Great people and very nice room,positive
"This B&B was beyond expectation; the host made us feel like we’d be her personal guests rather than just hiring an accommodation. Its location is not at the city centre, but getting there with public transportation is rather quick & easy and if one is driving, parking infront of the house is free. The area is quiet and safe. The nearest restaurants are a few minutes walk away.",positive
"One elevator was broken and during a stay of one week it wasn't repaired and that led to long waiting times.,

The staff was very helpful and friendly",positive
"Shower-head suspender was broken off which meant you needed one hand to hold it. Too few settings on the heater made it tricky to get a good temperature that lasted to the morning. No residential computer available. Steep pricing when travelling alone but return-of-value above other accommodations available to me at that time in Leuven. A fair amount of smokers however I smoke myself.,

Well-located room made it easy to get a fresh breeze going, clean and comfortable sofa, retro TV, electric heater with ventilator allowed for quickly warming up the sleeping area. Shared public waste bins allowed for some sorting of household garbage, birds and a half-domestic cat roamed the inner garden area, which had plenty of benches and a stone-grill. Though the walls are obviously thin it was mostly quiet throughout the night. Professional and friendly staff.",positive
"Way too laud in the room... and the smell of the building was really like old buildings smell,

The Staff was really nice and everything was exceptionally cleanLocation is very central",positive
"Location.. Although it was perfect for work. ,

Globally all was fine. Hotel has been refurbished although could still do with a new lift.
Room is big and comfortable/clean. Staff are friendly.",positive
"None.,

Bed is very comfortable.Female Owner is very friendly.There is a home made beer brewery next to the hotel, so you can ask for a small tour on the production of beer for free, which is very interesting to me!And their beer is must-try in Brugge.",positive
"Very nice host, good location, if you want to explore the south eastern parts of Brussels. Tram/subway connection to downtown and trainstation
Quiet neighborhood. You will be the only guests and can enjoy the carefully renovated  classic Brussels house. 2nd floor is all yours.",positive
"Hotel is very representative, look so good and neighborhood is so beautiful and safe. You get shampoo, gel shower and body lotion so you don`t have to bring those. Also you can make coffee or tea in the morning in your room.",positive
"The room is not totally clean due to the spider web on the roof of the room. Also, there was a lot of movements and thus one can not stay without hearing background noise especially when someone is walking or opening or closing the door. The breakfast needs to be improved on.,

The property feels like home. Almost everything you need in an apartment is available. The apartment I stayed in was the Executive studio and it was fully furnished just like other studio apartments in the property.  The host was very very welcoming and when I had an issue with the heater, it was replaced immediately.   Alots of restaurants close by.",positive
"The water heater turned off by itself, and we didn't have hot water for a while,

Super detailed attention, excellent breakfast with freshly baked croissants and the room was huge.",positive

The rooms are big, quite comfortable and clean. As said above the location was perfect for work purposes.",positive
"Nothing - we could have stayed longer than our 4 nights!,

Charlotte and her husband Kristoph are great hosts. Charlotte provided an excellent breakfast and went to great lengths to accommodate our coeliac friend. Comfortable ensuite rooms with a lovely lounge/dining room and garden for common use with the other guests in the three room B&B. Excellent honesty bar from their brewery next door. Kristoph has extensive knowledge of brewing and is happy to share - both verbally and by tour if you are interested. We were! They also have a tasting room in the brewery that opens as a low key pub on Saturday until 6. B&B is on the route 4 bus into town that goes to the train station too. A wonderful welcome and an excellent stay. We will be back!",positive
"very nice, beautiful, quiet house. House owner is so warm and helpful!",positive
"The rooms are very dark. The water drain in the bathroom, also not great.,

Helpful stuff that know how to smile (with exceptions of course). Very good location, metro station is very close and the walking distance to the center is also very acceptable.",positive
"In the room, there is no wardrobe, only a small console beneath the tv set, so you have not got much space to keep your clothes, but actually, I was not a big problem for me.,

The staff is really friendly, there were no problems. The center and the train/bus station is pretty close, I guess around 10/15 min on foot. Nearby, there are carrefour express and great callisthenics park!",positive
The apartament was nice and had everything we needed for a short stay. The host was very communicative and helpful. We really appreciated the option to store our bags after the check-out.,positive
"Baths services... more Towel please.,

Map location, Breakfast, Silence and Price.",negative
"Location and entrance Parking was initially not really clear due to road works in town and not recognizable by GPS. Strange and marginal people hanging around in the vicinity of the hotel which is located across the train station which may give you an unpleasant feeling of being not safe.Although there's a facility in providing a protective glass door which prevents splashing water while taking a shower standing upward in the bath : one ends up in a swimming pool when stepping out of the bath after being showered ( wet floor ) as water flows in between the glass door and the bath => tried preventing this the next time by putting a towel in between that gap ...  but unfortunately in vain :(,

Clean room,  clean & spacious bathroom",negative
"It was actually pretty goodTHe reviews are not the best, yet it is a very good place, good room and everything.",positive
"Everything was fine.,

We had a lovely large room at the b&b with a very comfortable bed. The room was very clean and quiet. The bathroom was large and there were plenty of towels and toiletries.We were able to park outside the house with a parking permit but you can park quite nearby without needing a permit.We stayed for one night and were the only people staying there. We were able to use the downstairs sitting area to relax when we got back from Bruges centre. There was tea and coffee available whenever we wanted it and there was a very reasonably priced honesty bar.We had a very nice  continental breakfast in the morning with fresh croissants, bread, cheese, ham and jam.The hosts are very helpful and pleasant and showed us round the small brewery that they run next door to the house. It took us about 20 mins to walk to Bruges centre either through the park or through some small streets. Both routes were very pretty.The b&b itself is a lovely old-style house in a residential street. It is beautifully kept and very comfortable.",positive
Every single bits and pieces  was just perfect. The staff was so polite and helpful and friendly. The room was so clean and great. Breakfast was amazing. Worth every single penny we paid. Will be back very soon for sure and recomend it to everyone.   The hotel realy deserve to be 5 star.,positive
"Doors let in a bit of cold, not much of an issue as heating compensates fully, but it is a pity.,

Perfect for our family + dog.",positive
"Everything was great. I struggled to find the B&B as the little sign is quite small. I did walk past it a few times!,

This B& B was excellent. The owners were lovely, as was the room and facilities. Breakfast was nice too. It was a really excellent stay with everything that I needed. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, it was very comfortable.",positive
The staff was very friendly,negative
"Immediate vicinity is a bit sketch across from train station but don’t be put off or worried by that, just walk around the corner to the pedestrian district.,

Fantastic staff around 24/7, so helpful and friendly! Great, convenient location close to everything but quiet and peaceful, super clean and secure hotel, great water pressure, great functioning A/C, and they welcomed our dog. Liked the convenient drinks available in lobby. Parking easy. Will stay here again!",positive
"The fact is that the exterior of the hotel (and immediate area) is bad, and the hall and stairs are extremely narrow and ancient. We didn't even want to try the elevator.,

Generally, I have no real complains, because I expected a catastrophe based on the descriptions of the area and some negative reviews of the property. However, the room was fairly spacious, bed genourmous, bathroom ok, everything clean, towels changed every day. I assume we had one of the renovated rooms, so I speak just for our experience.",positive
"N/A,

The owner is extremely friendly and customer oriented.The location is also good (walking distance to downtown) and it has a parking (not easy to find in Brugge).",positive
"The only thing we could point out was the unevenly distributed lighting in the room.,

The breakfast buffet was excellent. Our room was very cosy, with a large TV, a queen-sized bed and a bathtub.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were right in the middle of the European Quarter. There were many more amenities we did not make use of because of lack of time. It's just five metro stops away from de Brouckère, close to Grand Place.",positive

Location was perfect and it was a very calm place. The staff is nice and breakfest is great.,positive
"Next to highway and the staff was not so friendly when we arrived and tried to speak French while checking in and didn't understand right away what he meant. They have self cleaning showers and toilets which my child found a bit scary and make noise when you have the room next to them. There are ordering restaurants nearby which just speak French too (pizza for example and that usual things) and where kind of expensiever (we saw a post for delievery after having payed already while the menu said it would be free, plus a salad (not on the menu was as expensive as a whole pizza!). We didn't used the nearby restaurant.Next to highway therefore not possible to sleep with window open due to the noise. Their was a kind of ventilation though it became warm during the night.,

Good for budget. Clean. Next day staff in the morning was friendly.The restaurant we ordered from was delievering to the room.Clean and with closed windows you didn't hear the highway.We didn't used breakfast but could get hot water (the coffee automate was broken).",negative
"The lights in the room and in the toilette did not work, since it was a Saturday nobody came to fix it, just the receptionist came to take a look, but of course he is not an electrician so he wasn't of much help. No room change was offered since they were full. One of the towels had a hole in it. ,

The receptionist was helpful with all the questions we asked, bed was comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet.",negative
"Old lift and long waiting!,

Location closed to Midi Zuid station. More halal food near hotel.",negative
"The room felt a bit old stylished. But this is not impacting the scoring I am awarding for this hotel. It is just that it is not in harmony with the very nice interior design you can see in all the public areas of the hotel.,

Very close to metro and train stop. Very fast and easy to get to city center, only 4 short metro stops away from Grande Centraal. And within 5 minutes of walking is the train stop with direct trains to the airport. Very convenient. Also, the bathroom was in perfect condition.",positive

The location and the room was nice.,",negative
"The style of this place is old-fashioned, but the furniture is really old.You should be ready to have breakfast with other guests in one dinning-room.We didn't get a receipt after paying for the stay.,

Great location. 15 minutes walk from the center.Good light breakfast. Very tasty!Very polite and helpful hosts. We could leave our bags after check-out and took them before the flight.Good place for its money.",positive
"Some toilets/showers were out of order and I imagine the guests that stayed near the toilets were always waking up with the noise flushing.,

Reception available 24/7. Clean sheets and towels, comfortable bed, sink with warm water and mirror in our bedroom was very convenient, good value for money. We stayed on the third floor and our wing had two rooms only and was very quiet. Does the job for one night sleep. Good location near the highway and free parking was great!",positive
"The location was not good. Very hectic during the day, very tricky to find a parking space. After about 7pm most of the bars and restaurants were closed and the area was full of people begging for cigarettes, or money, or food. Quite scary.,

Huge comfortable bed. Friendly staff.",negative
"The room was very clean. There is a desk with two chairs for working, and a closet with mini bar and safe. 
The mini bar can be turned off with a remote so it doesn’t make any sound while sleeping. A nice touch!
The bathroom has a big shower, which was really nice. 
Wifi was perfect for watching a movie or get some work done. 
The view (I had garden view) was really nice. When I opened the curtains in the morning I was greeted with a squirrel climbing a tree :)
When you arrive, they ask you to checkmark a list with all the things you want for breakfast. I really appreciate this act against food waste!
Breakfast itself was tasty and plentiful! It was clearly prepared by people with love for food.
I was on a work trip (alone), but definitely considering coming back for a weekend with my partner. This is an ideal stay for a get-away!",positive

"They were still renovating some parts - probably this was delayed due to Covid-19 - It didn't bother us as such, but soon the place will be even better.,

The room was bigger than we thought and the breakfast service and food were excellent. Staff spoke several languages. They have a respectable menu and bring in fresh products from local sources. (I think even the yogurt was homemade).",positive

"I first stayed at this hotel about 18 years ago and I was so impressed with its location, decor and historic charm that I have visited there almost every year since.",positive
"hotel is really old, and there is no elevator to the higher floors, and the stairs are really narrow. I have to say that the breakfast room is too small and too cold, I had to eat my breakfast in my jacket. And 13€ for a breakfast with no scrambled eggs or any kind of warm food is just ridiculous.,

staff was very friendly and helpful, the hotel is in great location just 5 min walk to the city center, and free coffee at the check in! Rooms are really clean.",negative
"The bathroom was a bit tired and the shower could have done with a bit of a scrub. The sinks didn't drain very well.,

Breakfast was served in the room and was a tasty croissant and rolls. Room was eclectically decorated which I really liked. Quirky but comfortable. Rates were very reasonable for two people. Location was good for most things, but not directly central.",negative

Free parking
Acceptable breakfast",negative

- Good price-value combination- 20 min walk from the city center, very close to Brussels-Midi- nice TV program selection",positive
"The only negative point was Covid-19.There were no further comments at all,

The Hotel is located in the beautiful village of Houffalize and is an ideal base for exploring the region.The owners immediately make you feel welcome and are very helpful.They have an extensive selection of local beers and the owner is a fantastic cook!The dishes are very tasty and based on local fresh seasonal products.Vegetarians are not forgotten either! My wife is a vegetarian and the vegetarian dishes were original, with fresh products and very tasty!The breakfast is extensive, including home-made yogurt.We can recommend this hotel to everyone!we will definitely go back.",positive
"The hotel is on the outskirts of the town so a car is needed to go out into the center. The hotel is on a main road so slight noise of cars during the night but nothing too difficult to handle.,

I don't think I've ever stayed in such a clean hotel! Everything was spotless. The owner was lovely and welcoming. Room was a good size with a lovely on suite shower room. Very big bed with comfy mattress and linen. Breakfast included fruit, home made yoghurts and jams, ham and various cheeses also available as well as eggs cooked to your preference.",positive
"The toilet paper scrubs too much :-(Few coffee/thee for multiple days stay, also the shampoo/shower gelThe heating doesn't work so good, takes a long time to heat and never reached 21+ degrees,

Very nice room, comfy bed, the TV and the facilities were excellent ! Shower was very comfortable !",positive
"they did not refill the  coffee and the boiler was not that clean plus the location of the hotel itself is a a place you can call it poupler,

the view was amazing we were in the 7th floor , there is a fresh buzz in the toilet :)",positive
"I stayed at the fourth floor and the street noise made me feel like I was just at the corner of the street. No noise reduction at all.,

Location.",negative
"I booked this through booking.com and the hotel clearly advertises spa facilities. When I arrived and inquired about this I was told by a rather rude lady at reception there are no spa facilities. She told me that there is the possibility to book access to spa facilities elsewhere however that this needs to be done in advance. In my opinion this is a case of false advertising.The shower room plug hole emitted a really foul smell which permeated the whole room.,

location",negative
"In my room there was a kettle, two cups and two sugar lumps.  Draw your own conclusions.  The shower was just a dribble and it was impossible to adjust the temperature to something comfortable.  The dribble was either too hot or cold then when I tried to get it hot again it took another 3 minutes for the water to heat up.  All these people are interested in is the CASH. They don't give a damn about the guests.,

The Wifi worked.  The TV worked.  The hairdryer worked",negative
"It's a functional place to get your head down. Just off the motorway. The room sleeps three, it was clean if a bit warm. The shared facilities were clean.",positive
"The only thing that bothered me was that it felt very warm in the gangway between the lift and the room. The price for the breakfast (which I didn't take) seems fairly expensive (about 20€ if I remember correctly).,

I liked the luxurious aspect of the hotel coming from the entrance to the reception. And I equally enjoyed the modern feel of the room which is well equipped. The bed was comfortable and the air condition was so much appreciated on that warm day!",positive
"The hotel’s lokalizatorom is perfect, close to the European Comission. Room is dowcipie, very convinient with very Nice bathtoom well equipped with cosmetics. Good value for money.",positive
"It was super near to the metro station and a grocery store, there was also a Greek restaurant owned by the host and it was just nearby, so if you want to eat there is that.
The apartment was clean and well equipped, we also had a small balcony and TV with international channels. 
Our host Dimitri was very helpful and a really nice person, he welcomed us very well and he helped with all of our necessities. If we go back to Bruxelles we are going to stay there once again, 10/10 recommended!",positive
"Rude staff, it took them more than one week to send me their invoice (as they failed to give me one upon check-out)",negative
"It was a bit of a shame we were not flexible to choose the time of dinner ourselves. The room downstairs is quite noisy, since it is that close to the reception, the kitchen and the exit. Also the fridge on the room is quite loud.,

We loved our dinner: presentation, taste... everything was really nice from starter to desert.Nice room with modern bathroom.Loved the attention for sustainability: big bottles of shampoo and soap instead of small bottles. Also the breakfast was very good.Access to Netflix was a nice extra.",negative

its i superb location, near the beach and the shops and the bars. It is not modern, well priced. good breakfast",positive
"The lift is missing, the bathroom small, the main entrance needs renovations, stairs are extremely narrow and a bit dangerous as well.
No kettle for tea/coffee in the room but they provided hot water. 
Clean Towels were missing twice (in 3 days).,

The hotel is located in the city center, close to the main attractions and stations.
Bedroom furnitures are quite new.",negative
"It is a house where a young family lives on the ground floor and rent rooms. You have to ring a bell to get attention; the lady is preoccupied with her very young children (understandably); and wants to go back to her children asap. I felt that I was intruding to someone's family and I tried to keep out of them as much as possible. There is no reception or entry. The room is quaint but again, like an old house: the lids of the tv hanging, one has to decide either to plug the tv or the heater. The light in the bathroom is economy, so it turns on after you have already been in the bathroom. Reminded me of my parents' house...,

Great location and some old charm character. Clean bathroom.",negative
"No toilets in the room. Toilets are cleaned automatically. Robots are not perfect.,

It was a great experience! The location is great and very near to the city. The personnel is friendly, helpful and speaks more languages than you can imagine. The view from the windows was breathtaking. We didn't took any breakfast, but we saw it in the vast dining room, and it looked and smelled great. A must visit for everyone who travels close to Herstal, Liege or Maastricht. We will definitely come again.",positive

"Better to have breakfast at every morning ,

Good lactation, 10 min walk to the Brussels North train Station , next to the tram station, near by  Brabant street , every thing was Comfortable",positive
"The lights on the landings and stairs were motion activated and/or on a time delayed button. Quite scary when getting out the lift at night into pitch blackness and not knowing when the light switch was. Ended up using the torch on my phone to navigate to my room.  The lift had a tendency to stop in between floors as it descended to the ground floor. I witnessed several guests panic as they struggled to get it working as it descended to this floor, and the same happened to me on my last day as I was leaving to catch my train. I’d say use the stairs but as I’ve stated, they were usually dark. ,

Great location, 2 minutes away from the sea front, public transport right on your doorstep. Staff were friendly & helpful.  I had an issue with the loo in my room and I was immediately moved to another room that was far larger and spacious. Breakfast was nice, continental style buffet. My first room had a sea view and a little shared balcony that was a nice surprise.",positive
Nice hotel near Rogier. Good room and an excellent continental breakfast. As a bonus it has a lovely old bar downstairs. Plenty of restaurants close by if you need an evening meal.,positive

Very close to the train station, good for 1 night",negative
"The hotel is located next to the main road and there are almost no sidewalks towards the station/city centre, only parking spaces.,

The hotel (and restaurant) are at a short distance from the station. The room is big, modern and clean, with a huge bed, which is quite comfortable. The owners are very welcoming and the breakfast is excellent. This is the perfect place where to stay overnight in this region.",positive
"We struggled a lot to find the underground parking of the hotel. At one point the hotel providid is with a instruction paper and than we made it. 
Contact the hotel before you leave about the parking! ,

Modern, new hotel with great facilities. Very clean and quiet. Location right in the center.",positive

"Lovely! Lovely house run by a considerate and kind host. Excellent location (close to the trainstation Zuid-Midi, and next to the metro), also if one has oppointments in the European Quarter. Very good value for money.",positive
"In no way should this establishment be listed as a Hotel, it is just about the most basic worker hostel level accomodation and apears to be used solely for single male occupants many of whom would appear to be immigrants . I did not feel at all comfortable to sleep  in this establishment and promptly left to seek an alternative rest stop .,

Nothing to like here",negative
"Great location, pleasant staff, spotlessly clean and comfortable",positive
"The shower wouldn't drain properly. It must have been blocked up or a pump not working?  Nearly flooded out the bathroom. I had to have a super-speedy shower and couldn't rinse properly  :-(   Not nice.  Also, the bar was just about to undergo refurbishment and they had no beers on tap and v little stock generally.,

Breakfast was excellent. Definitely worth including if, like me, you appreciate a decent breakfast. Room nice, bed comfortable, staff nice. And general cleanliness was v good.",positive
"Very comfortable, good kitchen to cook your own meals, clean bathroom and TV with Netlix. Also the host was really kind and friendly",positive
"Small lift, very noisy on Friday/Saturday nights - loud music and people yelling from the club next-door near after midnight until about 3AM next day.,

Just about 400m from Zuidstation (Midi) and convenience stores, staples, restaurants, all within 2 minutes' walking distance. Comfortable stay overall. Very helpful staff and they have a small cloak area too to park your luggage after check-out.",positive
"Due the Corona virus we did not enjoy a normal breakfast, but in any case it was acceptable.The spot in the town is perfect.",positive
"The WiFi didn’t work the last day I stayed, 1st January, but it works very good in the lobby. The lobby is small. Sometimes In the midnight is a bit of difficult to fall asleep because there are people yelling in the street.,

It’s very near from a tram. Also, to get to the center city is very near, but is recommended not to walk near the nodstation, is a “complicated” zone. The TV has Netflix. The warmer works very good. You can get a room with a sight of the Atomium.",positive
"It’s all a bit dated and is in need of some renovation. Breakfast is average.,

Great location, wonderful art deco café, clean.",positive
"if you are staying on 5th floor the lack of an elevator is a problem. The girl from the reception desk was not very nice or helpful. As an advice, please double check your booking, because they will try to trick you and make you pay more for less.,

Rooms are nice and comfy.",positive
"Very cold and it is turkish 3 stars,

Clean small room",positive
"After seeing the photos on the website I was disappointed to be given a very budget room overlooking the neighbouring wall,  Double bed was comfy but took up 2/3 room, I had to rearrange the furniture to avoid tripping over it in the night!  The hotel had an air of faded grandeur about it, but this room had faded quicker than most.,

Location was excellent for a concert at the Kursaal  Casino and the seafront.  The double rooms on the front looked very nice from what I could see when the cleaner left the door open.",positive
Staff was very kind and helpful.  Room was very clean.,positive

"Room was dark, like a cell. Shower room was tiny,  toilet was separate with no whb. Window opened onto a service shaft. If I looked out and up I could see the sky FAR abive. .IT SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AS A BEDROOM IN BOOKING COM. I complained, and changed rooms after 1 night. 2nd room was normal, ok. Also the lift was out if order after one day, there are five floors! I was on the 3rd.,

Location",negative
"I liked all the features. The staff didn't need to change my towels after only one usage.,

"Very small shower with curtain around - it is challenging even for small person to move around. For the 1st floor rooms - while they do have access to balcony, there are no separators between rooms (you may not feel comfortable leaving balcony open even in the heat as you never know who may access your room through balcony).,

24/7 reception which is quite rare on the Belgian coast. The hotel is few metres away from the Casino and the beach. There is public parking (Kursaal) available right next to the hotel (24/7).",positive
"Hotel was under renovation and was actually closed but we were not made aware of this.We had booked breakfast but bar floor was being revarnished so bar and breakfast were not available but we were not made aware of this.  We were not charged for breakfast but were just told abruptly that breakfast was not available.Television did not work and when we complained we were told that no televisions in the building were working.Noisy work on the renovation went on until 10 to 11 at night.Unusual room in that whoever was having a shower was visible to the other occupants, not so bad if just your partner but not really suitable when your daughter was in the room.Not to do with the hotel itself but walking around in the evening was disconcerting given the number of families sleeping out on the streets between hotel and Grand Place and them arguing with each other as to who should be begging off you.Hope the hotel will be renovated sympathetically, it just would have been good to know what state it was in at the time of our visit that should not have taken place, who was at fault? Hotel or Booking, don't know. Hotel said they told booking so would have expected a message from Booking assistant.,

Nearby parking was close and safe.Reasonably situated.",negative

Near to the beach",negative
"It was so hot in the room it was impossible to be comfortable. The listing of the hotel was very misleading. There was no sauna or gym facilities. It was just rooms above a tavern. It was very overpriced . Also they run out of towels which is not acceptable when your paying €125 per night!!,

The best thing was the jacuzzi bath and the bed was nice and bad and very comfortable . The staff were very helpful and friendly.",negative

"The room had an old, dusty smell, even if it was clean, probably because of the old furniture and carpet.
I think the window had a problem because I could hear all the car noise from the street, even if it was a quiet area.
The AC I don't think it was working properly on heat, set it to maximum but not warm enough for me.,

The location is great, close to the Commision Europene (you could see it from the window) and to the metro station.",positive

The staff was charismatic and helpful, the room was ok.",negative
"Breakfast not comprehensive or continental. Close time of 9am NOT customer friendly. It was a rude shock to come down at 10AM on a Monday morning to find the breakfast area cleared. I think it's a disservice not to give customers an opportunity to enjoy what they have paid for and rightly too.,

"No air conditioner.  When I asked at booking, I was told Belgium cool so it was not needed.  Room too warm during day so we avoided staying in the room during the day.  Outside street under repair.  Area noisy.  Handrail painted white was filthy.  We were on fourth floor (our 5th).  Stairs narrow.  Window had broken hinge upper right-hand corner so it did not work properly.  Paper basket would hold maybe a quart-sized bag.  We always had to find a bag or some way to contain trash.  Asked for an extra pillow, and it was there when we got back to the room in the evening.,

Location great.",negative

The room where they serve the breakfast has a very nice atmosphere. The bedrooms are quite modest and bathroom could benifit from renovation. Saturday night we experienced quite some noice from the street. But breakfast in the morning makes everything ok,positive
"Strangely enough: nothing. Maybe breakfast could have included (warm) scrambled egg. But not crucial from my point. ,

I booked the hotel at short notice and primary driver for selection was to be as close as possible to the location I had to get to. I did not expect anything special. What a nice surprise I got. From the outside, the hotel does not look much, but my room was superb. (see pictures). Nice staff, very accommodating. Stayed in a room that was pictured on a postcard from the 1940ies.",positive

Nice room, a bit hot, and apparently the windows cannot be opened. But otherwise clean, modern, nice shower. All I needed. Meeting rooms OK as well.",positive
"The neighborhood where the hotel is located may seem a little sketchy at night, but nothing bad happened to us.,

Friendly staff nice breakfast",positive
"It wasnt what I expected with wellness as was mentioned on the page display. The wellness is not in the hotel itself but somewhere externally. The room wasnt as nice also as expected. Ive spend less for more luxury. And the noise of the church in the morning, every half hour was really bad. Got in late but couldnt sleep in the morning because of that.
No elevator available.,

The room was big enough and good curtains too, to keep the light out.
Nice and friendly staff.",negative

A renovated apartment with obvious efforts in maintenance; clean, tidy, private The location seems off the center but it is actually very conveniently located; a few subway stops straight to the core center of Brussels and a few bus stops straight to the major train station. Even better is the bus stop and subway entrance are both right in front of the house. As this spacious studio apartment is located in the residential area, you get to live like the local with a very reasonable price. The landlord was kind and swiftly responded to my inquires.",positive

I changed the room, because the smell of the previous room was awful, the second was slightly better, but the smell came trough the bathroom and I had to sleep with the window opened - 2 degrees! Sound proof between the rooms horrible. Could hear people’s conversation right next to my room at 1 am.,

Clean, refurbished, well located!",negative
"The strong perfume smell was killing me, I am allergic but fortunately I could open window to get rid of this in the room itself.",positive
"Our room had a window on the children playground that was not well acoustically isolated. So we couldn't have some silence in our room until late in the evening. Not ideal to relax... Also during the breakfast, the team should make sure that guests with children keep all civilized and behaved and don't start shouting or making panels fall on other guests.,

For the room, we liked the design, the cleanliness and the comfort of the beds. We also liked very much the breakfast variety, quality and room. The location is the hotel was ideal for us to go downtown and to beaches in Belgium and Netherlands. And the staff was kind.",positive

They didn’t want to charge to our room even though we had left a sizeable guarantee on our room. They did get it straightened out though. Not sure they had a really kitchen and chef...it looked like the food was coming from a small fridge in the bar area and being reheated! And it was not cheap! The house keeping staff came into our room in the morning before we were even dressed....can they not check their computer or something to see who has checked out?? 😡 ,

Undeniably beautiful location, however rooms are small, and spartan to say the least. Beds are uncomfortable and avoid taking a room with a view of the inner court yard because it can be noisy in the evening. Breakfast was not up to standard. Staff are friendly, restaurant was good (good value as well) but we had expected more to be frank. Would I recommend it to others? yes for the location but not for the comfort.",negative

"The room I had was one for persons with disabilities ( though I didn't ask for one ! ), almost empty, no cupboard door, no minibar, no hairdryer, no sofa and no alarm clock ( all these were in the description of the Superior Double room I have booked ).There was no desk to write or work something.The room was cold when I arrived and it took until next morning for the AC to raise temperature from 19  degrees C to 22, in the bathroom there was no heating system, so the atmosfere was very unpleasant. No rack to dry the towels.The toiletries were reduced to douche gel, shampoo and a small soap, no paper tissues, but plastic cups, and paper cups for coffee .    I was supposed to have a double bed, but there were 2 single beds, united (uncomfortable !).    The cleaning lady entered the first day, arranged a little bit the bed, emptied the trash can from the room, and didn't touch anything in the bathroom ( no cleaning,no fresh toiletries, no towels, no emptied trash can from bathroom ).And nobody came again for cleaning, until I left. Very far of what I know as a 4 star hotel room, and definitely different from the presentation on the hotel site.     Very disappointing !,

Very good location of the hotel.  Lobby is open and nicely decorated, you could stay wherever you like, for the bar or restaurant.Reception staff and all the people working in this area are doing a great job, they are nice, polite, attentive and efficient.",negative

"I said it above,

I arrived at the Brussels Midi south train station by bus around 7 :30 pm, I did get instructions from the hotel and google map directions to the hotel but I was working from a different exit and got a bit off track. Alrthough getting help from locals it took about 15 mins to get back on track ,the road which runs parrallel to the one suggested was strewn with uncolected garbage all over. There were many unoccuoied ssemingly abandoned buildings along the way,frankly I was feeling a bit worried but was eventually confirmed I was on the right direction to the hotel which shiuld be 5 mins away. Coming from three towns in France,Rheims,Leon,Grenoble which are beautiful, where I was seemed like a ghetto from the Third World.I eventially found the hotel on a little sleezy looking street , menories of Salvador In Brazil worldcup 2014 returned. The front desk was speaking english and pleasant and tried to resuure me the hotel and surrounding wer fine and safe. He warned me about how to use the elevator as the controls were not working well, I still did get stuck for a moment,quite discincerting. The room is small and old but had all the necessary conveniences. As usual I am eager to go outside and see the surroundings and I was informed by the Front Desk on places to have dinner and that it was safe. The initial outside of the hotel is really Third World dirty tiwn looking and feeling but 5 mins walk to the left and up the road the place is transformed to a fairly nice European city with nice restaurants .My dining was good,I have no complaints.Finally on my departure the next morning ,I made sure to get the correct routes and it was indeed 5 mins and a completely different landscape with proper buildings Trams and hotels. The best asset of this hotel is its nearness to the Trains Station.I would say its worth arounnd  Eu30 per nightnnot Eu50 . That neighborhood is under reconstruction,perhaps when that is complete, the whole experience will improve.",negative

It is not possible this situation hapen in a front of 4 stars hotel.

On a major tram line straight into the old centre and a short walk form the MSK museum with amazing Van Eyck exhibition.Breakfast was fresh and generous and nothing was too much trouble.",positive
"Unfortunately there was a lot of noise from the square in front until late.  There are a lot of drunks etc. in Liege unfortunately.  It’s such a shame - a perverse difference between the superb cultural scene and people in the saddest situation...not the fault of the B&B of course but the local government could be doing a lot more to help this appalling drugs problem that Liege clearly has.,

Beautiful building original main house and super renovation in the other.  The bed was very comfortable and breakfast superb.",positive

"January 2019 comment: There has been some construction work on the breakfast room, but the overall result is bad for me (design and food got worse). I guess it supposed to be ""more exclusive"" but I don't think that more seating place was gained. I think the new set-up has lost its unique feeling what was given by the garden-view. I think its darker in the room after the reconstruction.  The food selection and the overall quality got weaker. This is only my impression, hopefully I just picked a wrong day.BUT, the heating system wasn't functional in the room, I received an electric (portable) radiator to produce some heat, but that wasn't enough.....,

Location is perfect for EU institutions.",negative

"The one bed provided with the basic stay is quite small and is framed on both ends which doesn't allow to be able to stretch out whatsoever, it would be better suite to a child than for an adult.The second room provided was quite fine with a large bed but the additional cost of $20.00 Euro per night for this additional room is only disclosed on the second to last line on the property rules list which led to a last-minute unexpected charge. Up front, clear, and concise disclosure of this fact would be beneficial to all renters.,

Breakfast provided was a loaf of bread, spreads, and a tray full of candy/sweets/cakes as well as coffee machines.We never met the host but the maid, who lives just around the corner from the property, was exceptional and went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable; she even provided us with our first meal by bringing us amazing home made crepes with Canadian maple syrup and sugar...truly awesome!!!",positive

Lovely B&B. The only thing is that the breakfast is not included in the price of the bed and breakfast. It isnt mentioned you have to pay extra on top of your stay. So that was a surprise. Cause the owner wasn’t present when we had to pay I emailed her about this (twice) but she didn’t replay at all. That a shame.,positive
"There were quite a few leaving instructions, some of which we felt the cleaner should be responsible for as there is a cleaning charge included.  eg stripping the bedding and leaving it in a particular place, emptying bins. It was also quote tricky to understand where things were being asked to go.We found the cooker difficult to use ( but that may have just been us) .,

I mean, absolutely terrible.  You have to keep the windows shut all day, otherwise you will not be able to sleep at night.  The problem then is that the apartment gets incredibly hot.  If we visit Bruges again in the spring or fall we will stay here.  But if we visit in the summer, we will probably stay elsewhere.,

my daughter have asthma she started coughing and we felt it smelled of strong smoke (hashish) I called directly to the front desk and asked what was happening at their hotel. they offered us other rooms but it smelled there too. there was probably someone who smoked in the room so it went into ventilation to the other rooms, unfortunately the clock was too much otherwise we had changed hotels, we also had to convert our new room when they couldn't help us with that.

Staff not client oriented at the reception and not organized at the restaurant.,

The Location is nice and it is very clean.",negative
"No negatives. If there is one small suggestion it would be a small freezer compartment in the fridge would be useful ,

The apartment was perfect for us. It was very well equipped with everything that would be useful for a traveller,  spotlessly clean and spacious.  Very well located for our purposes as we wished to be near the Atonium for the Tour de France start. However easy to reach the centre by metro. Could walk to bakery supermarket and restaurant.  Very helpful lady Jacqueline met us to give keys and free parking in locked garage was a bonus",positive
"Basic breakfast, I think they need to add more varieties.,

The staff very friendly and always trying to help.
Very good location, many restaurants nearby, main supermarket just behind the hotel, tram and bus stations just 5-8 min walk.",positive
The host was very pleasant and I liked the area.,positive

Great helpful friendly host. Comfortable apartment. Quiet surrounding.",positive

Everything, well situated, clean, quiet, nicely decorated.. breakfast is excellent. Much better than in an hotel.",positive

friendly staff at the reception,positive
"Beautifully renovated castle and adjacent farmhouse.
Great ambiance during the evening.
Excellent food served individually to each room in full respect of Covid rules.",positive
The stair case to the apt was narrow and carrying the luggage 2 floors is quite difficult..,positive
"Wifi was misfunctioning making it sometimes completly unusable. It wasn't a big problem for us, but it might be for people from outside of the EU. ,

Good breakfast, but kind of boring and without any variety (but with that price you shouldn't expect more). Rooms are clean. Localization is also good, with many grocery shops around and about 20 min from city Center by bus.",positive

Friendly staff. Comfy bed. Good shower. Good location.",positive
"The information on Booking.com about how meals are served etc could be improved. Also there are accomodations outside the main castle building and inside, this should be clearly indicated in the site.,

The castle/palace is really amazing, with nice inner court and park. The food was also very good, both for diner and breakfast. Despite the complicated situation, the staff tried to make the stay as enjoyable as possible",positive
"Be prepared for the 2 flights of  narrow steep curved stairs to the apartment. The breakfast is, as expected, a ""do it yourself continental"" type but without cold meats or cheese. (Milk  sachets, orange juice, nespresso coffee, (a few) tea bags, white bread , jam, water, cans of coke, butter, 2 large bags of crisps and a tray containing assorted chocolates, cakes, sweet & savoury biscuits is provided).,

The apartment is spacious, modern inside, well lit, very comfortable, beautifully furnished and equipped. The quality of towels,bedding etc is high. BBC1 and 2 are available on the TV as well as assorted other channels. WiFi signal is strong. Nadia was very VERY helpful about collection of the keys and our arrival plans. The location is ideal for the Expo centre, Atomium and Mini Europe attraction nearby. To reach the centre of the city use  the Metro or Tram system both of which are easily reached from the apartment.  There are 2 large supermarkets a 10  minute walk away, plus a fruit/veg/ small supermarket a  5 minutes walk away. We enjoyed a meal in the very good Italian restaurant just around the corner.",positive
Very friendly staff! Able to accomodate a room for us after cancelling from another hotel which was complete trash(Sun Hotel) Couldnt have been happier with the stay here!,positive

"You cannot open the windows. There is no wall between the room and bathroom! In the minibar It was only one bottle of water. Nothing more! I asked for more and room service refused. ,

Clean, Good bed, Close to train station. The terace of the restaurant is pleasant. You should try the Tbone steak for two person.",negative
"The is a little bit of noise at nights because just next to the building there is a night club. The lift is really old, and the moment I was about to leave the hotel, the lift got stuck with people inside... but at the end it was nothing extremely bad.,

The internet service is perfect, and the rooms are very comfortable. It is 5 minutes away from the train station, and 15 minutes away from the Grand Place.",positive
"Cleanliness - lacking! Floor very dirty, hairs on the bed linen, tea cups also not clean, towels with yellow spots. The pictures attached show a white towel after having been passed over the floor.,

Location is relatively good and view from upper floors very nice; staff was responsive to claims on cleanliness. No breakfast option offered.",negative
"This is the closet you will be to the Jemeppe Castle which is used has a bate for you to book beceuse you sleep and eat at the old service farm facilities quite well renovated to modern times.
The Room. Small with small double bed of 1.5 mts at most. The only window you get is one of 50 x 30 cms facing the terrace of the restaurant. No TV set, neither coffee and tea facilities were present. Upon check in the recepcionist told us that due to Covid 19 protocols the housekeeping service will be reduced at minimum, just to straight down the bed and to change the towels if we previously left them on the floor. This is unacceptable I run a hotel myself and we clean the rooms for our staying over guests as we have done before the pandemic. The only thing we require is the window has to stay always open while making the room and the guest must be away as usual. Our staff is protected with mask and gloves in order not to take any risk. As the pillows provided are so big and thick we asked to the maid and she kindly provided two long and thiner ones which allow us to sleep and rest better which we could not do first night.
The shower was great (rain type one) however the handle to regulate the temperature was missing so in order to get hot water (maid did not check previously neither technical service could left at the warm temperature at least) because to be able tu turn it with bear hands you hurt yourself I will attach picture in this report)
Last but not least even staying in the middle of the wallonian Ardennes the company that runs the restaurant is from Flandes so you better speak their language or English. Funny!!!! Only few of them do.
Breakfast was not Covid minimum standards. Staff where wearing mask at all times and gel was available at the entrance but coffee and dishes where on the table long time ago exposed to contamination. Scrambled eggs, charcuterie, etc were aligned in a table near the kitchen exit to be served without any protection. Eggs served cold.,

The site is in a great location sorounded by beautiful fields and forests. You see at the entrance a litlle far away the castle which is gorgeous and impressive but...",negative
"Nothing,

The location",positive
"Very helpful and friendly staff who ensured we had a taxi booked for the morning, an early breakfast (an hour before their usual times), and provided details of local buses plus a city map for the evening. The reception area is bright yet relaxing, with comfy seats. Breakfast was excellent. For a budget hotel we were very happy with everything.",positive
"We liked the flat a lot, only the location could be closer to the downtown (but that was already expected by us). However, there is a bus stop nearby and you can always take a 25 min walk like we did to the city center.,

Nice small and cozy flat, with all the facilities needed for a comfortable weekend out.The hosts were also nice and we had a pair of good Belgium beers as a welcoming gift. They also offered us parking space inside the house, however we were not traveling with a car :)",positive

"It was the worst experience of my life. I had booked a double for two nights,we slept one night, but the next day when we came in the afternoon back to our room, our things where missing. I went to the reception, and my luggage was in the luggage room, because they mixed up the room numbers. The hotel thought we forgot to check out!!! All my things were packed by someone in our suitcases and in plastic bags!!!! Unacceptable!!!!!",negative

Cosy, modern studio apartment with everything we needed.",positive
"322 room was small for such price, interior old fashioned but clean, bathroom crying about renovation, not very clean because of aging and bad quality of interior finishing works.,

Extremely good location for business in EU institutions, just at Schuman train station 15 min. from Zaventem airport. Good breakfast , comfortable bed, poor mini bar but for free.",negative
"A little microwave in the room would have been nice. Otherwise nothing ngf was wrong,

Oh, this place was beautiful! The room was lovely, and in a perfect spot. Less than 10 minutes from the train station. We also walked into Ghents main square.
Janet our hostess was BEYOND EXCELLENT.  She was kind, and thorough.  She made us feel at home. The breakfast every morning was fantastic and we couldn't ask for a better place. We will come back. 
If I could I would give this place 10 stars.",positive

Thank you for the upgrade!,positive
Location is not good for families.,negative
"The cleanness and tidiness was zero, i stayed for three nights, I was given an upgraded room on the first night as the room i was given upon check in was not cleaned for ages,  and that upgrades  room was not cleaned at all on the third day , the bed was very comfortable and the administrator was professional",negative
"The apartment is perfectly located if you are going to the stadium or a fair (I was traveling for the latter), less so if you are looking to visit Brussels. But with public transportation, the center isn't that far away.,

It is truly a 2 bedroom apartment, furnished with taste and with all of the appliances for a comfortable stay.I traveled alone, and so used the main bedroom that has a very well equipped walk-in closet. The kitchen has all that one would need. The living/dining area is of a good size. I actually could not really use the place, as I was traveling for a conference and so only used it as bed and breakfast, It would be perfect for a small family spending a few days in Brussels.",positive
"The chairs in the room; hard to work.,

Warm and cozy.",positive
"If you are not good with stairs it is not the place for you.,

Amazing hosts and 35 min stroll into the old town.",positive

"We absolutely loved this place. It all felt so luxurious. 
The room (we had room 5) was gorgeous. Everybody was super friendly. The breakfast was fantastic and the location is perfect. We only stayed for one night but we will definitely come back to stay longer.",positive
"A confusing and 'round-the-houses' drive through one-way streets in an unfamiliar city, in order to access underground parking, requires improvement.'in-the-room' version of the bathroom probably acceptable for a single person for one night but otherwise unacceptable.,

Centrally located and therefore suitable for us.",negative

Friendly staff, clean and fully equipped bathroom",positive
"I did not like anything. It was very dirty, smelly, dodgy and I felt very unsafe at the hotel. Reality was FAR different from the photos provided, and the price performance is scandalous.,

I did not like anything.",negative
"No lifts to second floor.,

The location",positive
"The property is far from the city center, which means a good walk from the tourist sites. The rooms are also fairly hot, but we opened the window for a bit and it was fine.,

The hotel was very nice. It's about a 15 minute walk to the Brussels Zuid station which makes it easy to get to. The staff was very friendly; we got a good restaurant recommendation from the front desk. Overall very good hotel.",positive
A dryer as well as a washing machine would be of great assistance!,positive

"Old, smells bad, towels dirty, not clean",negative
"First of all the cleaning of the rooms were bad, broken bathroom door and paint falling off, there was no milk or creamer kept in the room when next morning I went to ask at reception they had just 4 creamers in the entire property which means only 4 people out of 13 people which we booked had coffee...
The beds were joint when we booked a double bed. I am sure you dont want to slee in between the beds.
Also when asked for the room to be clean they said there is no staff and will do it tomorrow. I think i own a refund 
,

The location was good",negative
"Despite not being sure when we would be there the day we arrived the host came in less than 10 minutes after we called and was very friendly and helpful. The place is so close to Atomium, that we left the car in the garage and walked all the way there, to get a feel of area. It is localted pretty central and has everything one would need nearby from supermarkets to restaurants and attractions.The apartment itself is spacious  and fine for 6 persons on a vacation. There was every appliance one would need staying there and WiFi was pretty fast.",positive
"Communication with the receptionist, very polite.",positive
"I have already completed this before

Flat well kept and comfortableproperty",positive
"I asked for a warm room but it was freeezing cold! I was there for a business trip and I mentioned that since I did the booking but the room had no acces to wifi and be careful if you have an iPhone , their old network doesn't support iOS. 
The walls were deteriorated with white shady creamy spots... and the door looked like I was entering in a ghetto place. (Room 118)
If you drive an SUV and you plan to use the underground  parking be careful because the lane is very narrow, long and difficult to drive. 
The staff at the reception (Helga) was extremely rude!!! Not customer friendly, it seems she forgot she works in the hospitality domain, not smiling, rude behavior, sassy&superior attitude.  ,

"In cold weather, we had to wait outside for at least 40 mins to get the key! At the beginning, the lady even asked us to wait for more than 1 hour! In the hall smelled always smoking...The door was very difficult to open with the key...it took a couple of mins to open.The cleaner who open the door had a cold face and does speak any English. All the beds are super small, we could not sleep well!Charged 20 euros per day for a little baby but did not provide any service... （normal hotels offer free bed for children under 3 years）.In the small room, the cabinet smells very bad because of the poor furniture quality... one of the curtains was broken.Thanks for this experience, I would always just select a hotel in the future!,

Although it said the breakfast was included... but only 2 small bags of mini bread were there for 4 adults for 2 nights stay! No milk, no eggs. Just some butter and gel in the fridge... the first day you finished all food, but no new food for the next day! Therefore, including breakfast is just for attracting people.",negative

"The windows can't open at all and I missed the fresh air. Pillows are very thick and no alternative available.Breakfast price is too high.Parking adress is different than hotel adress: property should mention it directly at booking moment so that's clear.,

"Did search for two bedroom apartment for two people. Got confirmation of apartment for two people but when we got there it was one bedroom with a double deb. Cleaning lady was helpful and opened a tiny room with a single bed which was not part of the deal for an additional €20 per day. Two flights of step dark stairs with our luggage was a nightmare. To cap matters when leaving the light in stairs went out while I was battling with luggage and I fell down the stairs. A warning should be posted re the stairs and difficulty for old people,

Very well equipped with great choice of tea, coffee, biscuits, sweets etc",positive

"We are return guests. We've found our favorite ""home base"" when in Gent for the jazz festival, or any other time! Conveniently close to the train station with plenty of parking, so there's no need to drive into the center at all. It's also only a 15 minute relaxing walk along the river into the touristic city center, or there's a tram stop nearby if that's your preferred mode of transport. The breakfast is excellent with choices among fresh sliced fruit, yogurt, bacon and eggs, croissants, breads and cheese (we choose all of the above)! Staff is very attentive.",positive

Stylish Belgium house. Fantastic home-like breakfast - even we have paid quite a lot for it, it was worthy to it.",positive
"The mattress in my room was extremely questionable. I kept feeling little balls under the sheet and the first night I was so tired that as long as these balls didn’t move I convinced myself to sleep. The next night I actually removed the sheet and saw lint balls all over this extremely thin and old piece of mattress. I paid 230 euros per night for this place and was shocked that given the state of mattress I would have rather slept on the floor!,

The restaurant and breakfast was great!",negative
"Our room was on the top floor and there is no lift, however hotel staff were very helpful in assisting us to carry our cases.,

Great location 2 minutes from the tram stop and close to the central station. The tram trip into the city centre takes about 10 minutes. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel had an intimate feel as there are not very many rooms. The hotel fit out is of high quality, and the rooms have air conditioning which we really appreciated as the weather was very hot when we were there. We enjoyed the excellent breakfast.",positive
Not sure where to start! A very warm welcome from the very friendly owners who showed us to our rooms which were just stunning. They have clearly spared no expense to build perhaps one of the most comfortable B&Bs we have ever stayed in-  fabulous bed and a big fan in the 35 C heat! To finish a delicious breakfast in a stunning breakfast room,positive

Convenient location for events at the European quarter. Subway station within 5 minutes' walk. Quite quiet at my 7th floor. Close to restaurants and bars. Nice, helpful staff.",negative
The room was large and beautifully decorated. Shimere was a perfect host and took care of all our needs.  Very welcoming and concerned about providing a high level of service.  Breakfasts were exceptional and  the stay exceeded our expectations.  We have no hesitation in recommending this location for holiday or business stays in Ghent.,positive

Beautiful old main building, well kept in authentic style. Annex is nicely decorated. Nice bathroom and good bed.",negative
"The fire alarm was blinking right above the bed, so after turning off the light and trying to sleep, a flash of green light disrupts the darkness and your hope of falling asleep. I stayed up until 5 am so I could be so tired to sleep with the major light on, cos sleeping with the big light on was at least better than a green light flashing in between unpredictable periods of seconds. For the next night in Brussels I booked somewhere else to save my sanity.",negative
"5 days with no WiFi, the hotel said they contacted the technician.,

Really clean, good shower bath and with no fluctuations in water temperature even when the hotel was at full capacity. House keeping actually clean the rooms. Close to town and tram stop. Helpful staff.  Great quality of sleep and comfortable bed and comfortable and bright room.",positive
"The floors were rickety though. I believe they needed to replace their flooring.Warning: the stairs from the ground floor main door to the second floor were very narrow and steep. The stair case was around 1 meter wide which tapered off to around 800 centimeters on the last 5 or 6 steps going to the second floor. We had great difficulty bringing our 3 large suitcases up and down. A simple misstep could cause us to fall down. It’s a serious issue when hauling a large and heavy suitcase going up and down. I wish the owners could address this issue immediately.,

We stayed here for 4 nights from July 12 to 16, 2019.Large spacious apartment. Living area, kitchen, dining, toilet (no bath) and laundry in the second floor. Two bedrooms and toilet and bath on the third floor. Large shower area.There is a TV set in the living area on the second floor with limited programming. But there was another TV set in one of the bedrooms on the third floor with better programming (in English).No AC. So we opened the windows to let the chilly wind in. There is a separate washer and drier. When we ran out of laundry detergent, we asked for some from the owner and she readily gave us some.Full kitchen with complete equipment for cooking and preparing food.Large fridge.Free WiFi with more than satisfactory speed. No issues with it.The owners left 4 bottles of Belgian beer in the fridge and bread on complimentary basis. It was very nice gestures. We enjoyed the bread. But since none of us drink beer, we did not touch the bottles. We stayed in this apartment to use as our base to visit the Ghent city center, Antwerp and Brugges. It was 2.5 km from city center. Instead of walking or taking the bus, we opted to use our car and park it in one of the public pay garages.There is free on-site parking in the apartment . It was a safe and secure covered parking with locked doors.The apartment is close to Campo Santo, the old cemetery in Ghent that they usually compare to Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris. We could see the tombs from our windows. (See photos) The gate to the cemetery is only around 20 meters from the door of our apartment. The apartment is literally in a quiet neighborhood.A Carrefour express (with parking) was around 200 meters away at the end of the road.A much larger Carrefour Hypermarket (with spacious parking) was around 2.5 km away.The hosts/owners were responsive.

Location, cleanliness and friendliness of the staffs.",positive

Good place to rest, very comfortable mattress! Quite big common spaces, with a very nice terrace in a typical Belgian style. Pleasant and attentive staff.",positive
"Not applicable,

Hosts and facilities were excellent - hope to return for a longer stay and will definitely recommend the place to friends and family.",positive
"Very noisy even in a room not facing the street, Insufficient noise isolation. Insufficient illumination in the room.,

Nice location next to EU buildungs",negative
"The internet connection was poor sometimes and breakfast was a bit the same every day. But generally everything was fine,

The location is perfect - very close to the train station, easy to get from/to the airport or other cities and also close to main city attractions. Staff was very pleasant and helpful, rooms were clean with huge beds.",positive
A more than adequate breakfast was provided. The hotel was convenient for public transport and free on-street disabled parking was available.,positive
"Couple of dead flies lying around and as ground floor studio could hear person upstairs stomping about. Not they best sleep.,

Excellent host. Most helpful and welcoming with two beers cooling in fridge.",positive
"the surrounding area. I felt like in the Far East. The streets were really stinky from piss and rubbish but it has nothing to do with the hotel itself.  I have no complaints about hotel at all.,

hotel is older but nice, the staff was pleasant, check in went smoothly, they even borrowed me a book-a tourist guide for Brussel- thumb up. the room was big enough, it had also a ketlle and a fridge. comfortable bed. nice breakfast - you could choose from many things. the best way how to get from railway station MIDI Brussel, is to take the tram to Orban station for 1.80euro and then it is 4 minutes walking. if you travel to/from Brussel Charleroi airport, it is close.",positive
"Only negatives I can think of is that the stairs were quite steep leading to the apartment, so if you have trouble with mobility be wary of that. A bit out of town but didn't bother us, you could walk to the centre in 25/30 mins. Last minor thing is that the curtains need to be thicker in one room as the sun lit the whole place up, some people like waking up with the sun but after many beers its not ideal!!  I'm nit-picking of course,

The apartment was fantasic. Great open plan living area with comfortable sitting space, dining table leading to a great kitchen that opened up onto a spacious balcony, great to sit and have a tasty Belgium beer that Martijn so kindly left for us. Bedrooms were extremely comfortable, as was the bathroom, with literally the biggest single shower I have ever used (and it was powerful)! Martijn was a great host, very friendly when meeting us and he has made a little tourist book with helpful tips (best bars in Ghent the number one of importance). He's done a great job!!! Taxi only 8.50 euros in the day and 11 at night to get straight into the centre of town. A really great place to stay!",positive
"This is a loft apartment - so two flights of narrow stairs to climb with luggage - and internet was slow and intermittent. Apparently a problem in the town rather than the hosts wifi which was working well with strong signal.,

My friend's young daughter told her friends on social media that this was the best place she had ever stayed in - better than Buckingham Palace! Location was perfect (5 mins from Town Hall & Menin Gate) and hosts very welcoming with on street parking opposite (but you need a blue disc to cheat the system). Facilities really excellent - the sort of accommodation you wished you owned - with owners' vegan restaurant on ground floor (closed unfortunately due to holidays during our stay).",positive

Owner was excellent. Location, old world style rooms.",positive
"Lovely helpful and flexible owners, spacious and clean premises, great value for money.  It's extremely handy to have a fully equipped kitchen in the chalet (it's like a granny flat).

Manager of property went above and beyond to help us.,positive
"Nothing!,

The room is in a self contained building at the rear of the Owner's house. It is a delightful room and fully equipped with everything essential and an awful lot more! There is an excellent Chinese restaurant 3 minutes away by bicycle and a good supermarket 10 minutes away. The pleasant town is a little further but has numerous shops, restaurants and cafes. I'd also like to say how helpful, friendly and ""all round nice"" the Owners are. I was cycling along a route associated with 1940 Prisoners of War and the Owner is both interested in history (across the centuries) and cycling so it was really hard to leave next day!",positive

helpful, attentive owner; good breakfasts, timely welcome and ability to sleep in the morning as soon as we arrived, quiet vegetated back garden below our room",positive
"This hotel room is a cozy small independent house located in the beautiful small garden. There is lots of nature around here. The hotel is located in the typical rural area of the Flemish region, and it is convenient to visit famous Belgian destinations from here. I spent very quiet and peaceful time from Saturday evening to Sunday morning. In the morning, I enjoyed clear sunshine from the skylight (window in the roof). The owners madam and her husband are so kind. The breakfast was excellent.",positive

Lovely location.  Staff wr excellent.",positive
"The staff is really great and helpful. The hotel is very well located and the stay though short, was lovely.",positive
"Almost nothing. I just wished I could extend the stay longer so that I didn't have to move to another place which happened to be quite crappy to spend the some of my vacation nights in Belgium.,

If you really want to cook however, there is only a small electronic device to cook on. The kitchen doesn't seems to equipped to really do any cooking.,

It's a very cosy historic house, picturesque.The bed is comfortable.the house is located in the very centre and near central stationgreat restaurants in the neighbourhood.",positive

"No staff. No breakfast,

Confortable and clean",negative
"Access to the car park is tricky if you are travelling in anything bigger than an SUV, and would be impossible in anything bigger than a Transit-style minibus, as it involves crossing a narrow bridge which also bends at the end. However, the hotel DO make you aware of this, so it's not a surprise. I'm also not a fan of keypad after-hours entry, which the hotel has, but that's just me.....,

The hotel itself is in a lovely location, and the rooms and interior have kept the rustic feel and decor of the old watermill which the building used to be. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and comfortable, and the big bath was a HUGE bonus for a weary traveller !",positive

"We stayed during a spell of very cold weather and the room was a bit chilly, specially on the morning when we left, because the heating was off. We could hear the sound from the traffic outside, but nothing that would keep us awake at night.,

Friendly host, huge bedroom with high ceilings, modern bathroom. Lovely house, recently renovated, balcony with beautiful stained glass. Very clean, comfortable bed and towels. Good location, between the Eurostar train station and the Grand Place.",positive

The bed was comfortable and it was cheap. It also has good transport links into the city.",negative
"One of the rooms we rented had had smokers staying in it. We had needed this room for the disabled access required by my mother. The owners had clearly made efforts to remove the smell, but this had not been totally successful by the time we arrived. It was also difficult to wheel my mother around in her wheelchair.,

A good beautifully located hotel that gave us a warm welcome and a comfortable stay, as well as a good breakfast. The location next to the River Meuse is very pleasant and there is a good restaurant attached to the hotel (which is an annexe). You get a lot for your money and access is acceptable (if not ideal) for disabled people.",positive

"I missed a desk to sit comfortably with a laptop and a wardrobe to hang my clothes. But the overall impression was so good that I didn't mind it much.I felt a bit uneasy when walking alone back to the apartment - if you are a woman travelling alone don't venture out at night.,

The apartment was very clean with a comfortable kingsize bed. The kitchenette was well equipped - I could prepare breakfast or a snack and have a glass of wine, too. The interior design and space itself made me feel special :) there were Christmas decorations in the hall and the place felt like a palace.It is very easy to get from there to the Grand Place - just a 10 minute walk.",positive
"My family and I stayed here, and the location was fantastic. However, the online pictures don’t really tell the entire story. The basement/kitchen is creepy and not satisfactory for a family. Additionally, the place was super dirty – covered in dust and cobwebs visible. It needs to be thoroughly cleaned.Our family booked other homes and hotels for a few nights due to the dirt and noise. If you are bringing your family to Brussels this place is NOT for you. However, if you have a younger group (college age) with no kids and no elderly people then then this is a place for you.",negative

Clean and big rooms, reasonably priced, easy check-in and out in Corona times, free parking in front of the hotel/surroundings, reasonable if you don't want to pay for the LEZ (driving permit) to the city center but want to visit Brussels by car, walking distance to the tram (around 30-35 minutes to the city center)",positive
"Bed frame was old, carpet was dirty, radiator held up with pieces of wood, bathroom stank of bleach but also managed to feel dirty at the same time. Window was broken (not the glass - it wouldn't open properly). Overall I was happy with my stay because the staff were so lovely and helpful - plus the food was delicious!,

Chinese restaurant had excellent food with a good menu selection. Staff spoke Chinese, French and English, were friendly, helpful and accommodating.",negative

Safe, toiletries, free mini bar with water and juice. Location great,",positive
"Just a minor detail: I would have liked a little better lights by the mirror in the bathroom. ,

Very good location! 
Large apartment with a lot of space.",positive
"The same elevator is used also by the cleaning ladies, and when we arrived at the hotel we had to wait for 15 minutes in order to be able to take the elevator. 
We stayed at the 4th floor and the room was cold, the heater was barely warm and we had to request an extra portable heater. 
The furniture is neither new neither maintained properly. The paint in the entire room was niked. 
The curtain was broken from place to place. 
The windows do not close properly and you can hear everything from the outside. 
In one of the nights another client/s smoked on the hallway so much that at some point the smell was also entering our room. The smell perssisted until the next day.

The staff is super helpful and they try to solve all your issues as best as they can.

This is a truly remarkable place.

Nevertheless, it was not enough and I had to ask for a room change. In another room the bed linen was not clean - hair and other dust were stuck in it. The location was not good either - the neighborhood looks unsafe, though quite close to the station. The lift was not there (or I was not informed on it properly).
Overall, the reviews are highly overestimated. The value for money is low.,

It was interesting to stay in a quite authentic place. Hotel management tried to be helpful.",negative

Love this place and shall return. An excellent breakfast and superb staff.",positive
"There was little to dislike. The whole place is gently scented with lemongrass so I guess if you don't like that, you are not going to be as happy as I was.,

The place was lovely: attention to all details and everything of the highest quality. For instance, the breakfast meats, fruits and cheeses were all top quality; the towels were sweet-smelling and fresh; the toiletries pleasant. The rooms are sparsely decorated in a chic but simple way that I found delightful. A gentle background of classical music plays all day in the living area and at breakfast. A particular pleasure was entering the breakfast area as the morning light hit the french doors, all the place settings perfectly laid out on a range of small tables in a tableau straight from an Old Master. Moments later, our hostess appears offering a range of cooked options and drinks and bringing a glass of orange juice, which was genuinely freshly squeezed.",positive

"Really nothing to dislike!,

Great location in the old and largely pedestrianised part of town near choice of restaurants with quiet seating outside, pleasant strolls and shopping. Beautiful room, I had a standard double which was plenty of space, huge wardrobe, loo and shower separate which was nice, shower and basin area was spacious and good pressure in the shower, lovely soap and shampoo. Proprietors lovely people who really care but in a friendly and non-fussy way, breakfast was gorgeous with everything fresh and baked on premises. The decor was elegant and restful yet homely — there was even English tea — altogether a delightful experience.",positive

"The reception only operated at certain times of the day and would be closed after 8pm. I arrived after this time, and had not received any communication to advise me of how to collect the keys from the safe. It was only because another couple arrived and accessed the safe that I was able to collect my key, otherwise I would probably have not been able to get into the room. I did try phoning the night duty manager (and I may have been doing this incorrectly), but I was not able to make contact with them. The fridge was inefficient and did not keep anything cool. I did speak to reception about it, but they said if I'd already turned it to the highest setting that this would be as cold as the contents would get.,

"Underground parking is paid and it seems to be a bit overpriced for €12 per day. This should be included in service. Also in the description a free parking in front of hotel was missing. The reservation was not needed. If we had known that beforehand we would not pay €24 for two nights. ,

In walking distance from the public transport. About 30 minutes from the heart of Brussels, 15 minutes walk from Atomium and mini Europe.",positive

The breakfast was really good, and the staff were super friendly. The hotel is situated in a wonderfully rural setting and provides an authentic experience!",positive
"Horrible support from the host.
The location is OK, except for the construction works done on the building, which will wake you up early in the morning.
The rooms are clean and nice.
The kitchen is OK, but it was partially functional: no hot water, no gas.
The bathroom is very narrow, no hot water, no ventilation, except for a creepy wooden door on the shower's wall which lead into a techical shaft.
You definitely can and should find better quality/price ratio location.
I booked the flat for 3 to 6 March.
I've checked in on the 3rd, in the evening, and there was no hot water. I notified the flat, thru booking message service, about the problem. Even though I repeatedly tried to get an answer from them, I've sent 5 messages and phoned twice from 3rd 2100 until the 4th 1200 asking for guidance, I received no answer.
I clearly specified in the messages that if I did not receive an answer by 4th 1150 I'll check out and rent something else.
I was in Bruxelles with business and I had to leave for work on the 4th around 1200. In the work space I had no possibility of using the phone so I had to make sure that at least for the remaining days (4,5,6) I'll have proper accommodation. On the 4th, after noon I've rented another hotel to make sure that when I return in the evening I won't have to go thru the same ordeal and I also asked booking for a refund.
Around 1300 Booking notified my that the flat has the intention to send someone at the apartment, but,  by that time I had already made another reservation, non refundable.
However on the 6th I received a very nice message from the flat, as if nothing had happened, to let me know I have to check out before 10 AM- a nice joke.
I'm now waiting for Booking to make the rental understand that they have to take responsibility for their business, as they are receiving our money intact and on time, not  with delays or shortage.,

The rooms, except for the bathroom, were spacios.",negative
"Only had a kettle in room with tea.,

"Niks,

Ligging is formidabel",positive
"Absolutely nothing.,

This is a small privately owned hotel, the proprietors and staff were so friendly, helpful and even purchased an air conditioning unit for our room as the temperatures were in the high thirties.  Excellent food, all homemade breads, pastries, jams and yogurts for breakfast. The dinner menu was extensive, all fresh ingredients and cooked to order, served  piping hot and beautifully presented either outside in the garden or in the restaurant. The room was clean with very comfortable beds. Parking was either just outside or in a car park two minutes walk away. We also securely park our bikes on the premises. This hotel was a real find. I would totally recommend to anyone to staying at this smaller hotel as the service, value for money and whole experience surpassed our expectations greatly.",positive
"1. When we arrived on the first day, we could not connect to the wireless network. After trying many times, we found that it was the equipment problem. The next day the landlord replied that someone would come to fix it, but when we got home in the evening, we found that no one had done it. When we contacted the landlord again, he did not reply for another night, and the next day the very official message said that we hoped to have a pleasant experience in Brussels and reminded us of the check-out time.
2. Before I arrived, the landlord sent me an email saying that the apartment was located on the fourth and last floor, but it was only the last attic.
3. The apartment is located on the fifth floor, with no elevator, a spiral narrow staircase. Passengers with large luggage are advised to book carefully.
4. The toilet is in a separate room, where the hand-washing area and bathtub are not in the same place as the toilet, which is very inconvenient.
5. On the third night there was no hot water, and on the last day there was no hot water.
We stayed here for three nights, including Christmas Eve and Christmas day. Apart from being close to the city centre (about 3 minutes to the main square), there was no wifi, no response from the landlord, no hot water and a very bad experience. First time writing that long review! Not recommended at all!!,

The location is good and near to the city center",negative
Er was stank in het toilet,negative
"We asked for two separate beds and they give us a double bed, even though we booked it far in advance. Lucky we are friends but not ideal. No fridge for our drinks. But overall, not much bad to say, was happy with my find.,

Room was excellent size. Lovely staff, they were amazing and so helpful. Fantastic location. Room was great value considering we went at xmas and the location. If I was going to Brussels again, I would stay here most likely.",positive
"All good,

Rooms were perfect and generously sized. Bathroom was also roomy.  Hotel was very clean and modern. Breakfast was wonderful with some of the best pastries we’ve ever had.  Nice extra was the upstairs verandah we could sit out on.  Views of rolling countryside for miles around. Very dog friendly which is essential for us. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",positive

The interior design of the apartment!",positive
"When we arrived we were shocked that they were still working around the houses. This was nowhere mentioned and we came to have some peace and quiet. We couldn’t sleep in because of the construction noises, we got a beer to compensate that but that doesn’t compensate our sleep. When we arrived the room was dusty, seems like it wasn’t cleaned for a while. We got dish washer tablets but we didn’t have a dishwasher. No soap to do hand dishes. There was a lot of light coming through the door which was very annoying. We couldn’t turn of the lights outside of our own door. When we wanted to shower we had ice cold water, we had to turn on the boiler ourselves. There was enough space to hang a TV to watch from bed, but there wasn’t one. The bathroom was without a door and the lights were terrible. We also had a huge stain on our bed sheets. Seems like the list is endless because it was! And oh, its a 20-25 minute walk to the beach, its not less than 1 km as advertised, it’s 100% more. ,

Parking was free and close to the building. We could check in contact free.",negative

"Avoid at all costs! Totally uncomfortable. No heating, Dangerous old buiding. neighboors complaints at 1am!,
We arrive to the place and the entrance is ugly, dark, old, we try to find de keys on the flat entrance and totally dark and complicated, once in the flat it seems correct but when we try to turn on the heating, it doesnt work, in the evening it was cold, the listing on booking says it has heating, we make a claim to booking and the next day appears the owner. He tells us is not possible to use the heating because the hot water for heating only works if the room is at a minimum temperature, and not when we feel cold. He tells us in summer is 20 degrees so you dont need... The weather in the early morning was 12 degrees and not 20. It's 1 am, we are working in the flat we LITERALLY only walk to the batroom and sit on the flat chairs. An african woman at around 1am knocks the door, she tells us he cannot sleep beacuse of the movement of the chair, we stop moving the chais, another time, at 1:30 the woman comes again and tells us she can hear when we are walking, and she tells us that the flat on booking is an illegal business that she has lots of problems with the persons that rent the flat... Totally uncomfortable situation. We tell the problem to the owner and he tells us, well you can make noise only till 10pm.... We were literally just walking!. We tell booking we can't be in the place without heating and with the problems with the neighboor and that we want to move to another place no matters if we have to pay the day we were there, we want to cancel the next days (we had a 7 days booking). Booking contacts the owner and he refuse. The owner tell us he cannot cancel because he has lost several of persons interested in the flat before of our arrival, not real cause we made the booking just one day before of our arrival ....
Honestly talking, this place was awful. we were worried to even go out and leave or things inside.
* Take a look at the photos!,

Honestly nothing. It was very uncomfortable to stay in the flat.",negative
"That we couldn't stay longer as the place was already book out. But we understand why, treasure like this is not very common.,

Beautiful nice decorated place with a fireplace and very kind and friendly owners. Welcome drink :-)",positive
"It would have been nice to have had a double bed rather than two single beds pushed together. It would also be good if there was a proper oven at the property rather than a portable oven which did work adequately but not sure if we would want to cook a roast dinner in it plus the manual isn't  in English which made it tricky. There are also several flights of stairs at the property which would potentially be tricky for less mobile individuals.,

The location of the property is excellent as it is a few minutes walk from the centre of Bruges and as it is down a side street the noise is minimal. The property has a garage which is ideal if you are travelling by car; we have an Audi a4 and it was big enough to accomodate this. The property is very spacious and there was plenty of room for the two of us! All of the rooms were of a good clean size and it was very handy having a kitchen which meant we didn't have to eat out. The property is warm as we travelled in December to the Christmas market so we had to use the central heating. Nadia met us at the property on arrival and her local knowledge was helpful. We would definitely stay here again without a doubt.",positive

"Although the owners have done a good job with the dining areas outside and inside. It is a lovely location to eat good food. However they need to work on the comfort and facilities in the bedrooms. for the English  market provision of tea making facilities in the bedrooms would be a big plus .Also the quality of the  bedding is not good enough. mattress could be more comfortable, one pillow is not sufficient. The toilets opposite the reception which are used for the bar area and dining areas, there was a smell of urine as u descended the steps to them .this area also needed decorating walls were grubby.No air conditioning or even a fan in the bedrooms . Some bedrooms had patio doors leading to a large  shared balcony area. this balcony was surrounded by a wooden fence which was totally unsafe. anyone leaning on this would fall. we were not warned .,

"No complaints, everything was perfect!,

This accommodation was truly amazing and one of the nicest places we have seen, a real home from home.  We stayed 3 nights but would love to have stayed for 3 weeks!  It is a cosy, self-contained property with its own front door and has a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and lounge/diner.  Parking is available right outside the door.  The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated/furnished and the brick ceilings give it a lot of character.  The double bed is very comfortable, blackout blinds keep out the light and the area is silent at night so you get a good nights sleep.  The kitchen is well equipped with microwave, kettle, toaster, fridge, electric hob and all the crockery and utensils you could need.  A breakfast bar makes a handy place to sit and have a drink or a quick snack.  The lounge is very comfortable and a dining table with four chairs is a great place to enjoy a good meal.  The whole property was spotlessly clean, the wifi was good and there are plenty of electric sockets.  The hosts, Virginie and Eric, are lovely people, so friendly and helpful.  They left us a lot of information on the area and were happy to answer any questions that we had.  One of the best parts was the wood stove and free firewood, and Virginie & Eric came in each evening and lit it for us so it was warm and cosy when we arrived back.  The location is great, on the edge of a small village but only a few minutes away from shops and supermarkets.  It is less than 5 minutes from the autoroute which gives quick and easy connections to other parts of Belgium.  A perfect base for exploring Wallonia with plenty to see in the area, and only 20 mins from Brussels Charleroi airport.  We would love to return some day!",positive
"The breakfast is poor. There are no hot dishes such as any kind of sausages or eggs or anything. Its just several kinds of salami, cereals and drinks.,

Location and having the whole house which was very clean",positive
"The reception staff were merely adequate, not very polite and certainly not friendly (very noticeable in unfailingly polite and friendly Brussels). The Nespresso (really?) machine is not intuitive to use; it makes noise and produces... nothing. Some posted instructions would help, rather than assume everyone knows how to operate these stupid coffeemakers. Really frustrating in the morning when you really need coffee and the machine seems all form and no function. Also, why was all the heating off in the room and bathroom on a freezing night in January, with giant windows looking onto an internal courtyard? Once the room is reserved, would it take so much to make a pass and turn on the heat so it's not a fridge when the guest arrives in the middle of the night? Highly unpleasant, and not expected at this price point.
HOWEVER. That is nothing compared to THE DEATH-TRAP BATHROOM.
This gloomy cave in dark wall colours and no bulb above 50 lumens is all sharp angles in concrete and tiles, with metal edge strips for added lethal potential. The bathtub/shower comes up to the mid-thigh and there are no handholds anywhere on the walls, making it a lovely treat to anyone with dodgy knees or mobility issues, risking toppling over getting in or out. There is no effective partition, so water sprays everywhere on the slick tile floor, adding another fun ""am I going to die now"" dimension. But the cherry on top is the 2 cm invisible step from the bedroom floor to the bathroom tiled floor. Too low to register in mind's eye, especially in the gloom of the room, but too high for one's foot to miss, especially as it's not expected. It also had a fun metal guillotine edge. I nearly broke my toes four times, getting angrier every time. Plus it made me stumble each time, forward toward the sharp, metal-edged corner of the bathtub. One day someone will trip, fall headlong onto that corner and crack open their forehead. It's absolutely ridiculous. Fix this.,

Wonderful location, basically steps from where I was (the extra night in Brussels was a last-minute decision) and where I wanted to be. The hotel is clean and functional. However, the design is a bit generic ""funky hipster"", like every boutique hotel in the world, which is getting a bit boring. Also: WAY too dark in colour choices, especially at night. You can't really see anything in your room, since they don't seem to believe in bulbs above 50 lumens. But clearly they tried. And it was fine for one night.",negative

I used to stay here ( it had a different name) regularly when  I worked with a nearby company.  Last stayed over 5 years ago. Not much has changed in the rooms, they are fine.

We really liked this room, it was perfectly clean, modern and located in the city centre. Everything what one needs for a one night stay.",positive

Breakfast was good, counter staff were also very well briefed.",positive
"The room was unbearably hot (sun shining in, closed windows) when we arrived. Given the southerly orientation you should allow ""tilted"" window untill guests arrive. The bathroom sink had not been cleaned; there were clearly visible toothpaste traces.Please do not advertise facilities such as breakfast if they are not available.The ""help yourself"" access to the keys (in an envelope at the unmanned desk) was not very welcoming.,

The beds were comfortable. There was a parking spot in front of the hotel",negative

"Nicely decorated rooms, polite staff, good cleaning",positive
"On our arrival we had been left a message telling us to phone Nadia to be sent the keys. Unfortunately our phones didn't have any signal but the pub at the end of the road were happy to let us use theirs so that problem was solved.We were slightly disappointed that the double bed was actually two single mattresses pushed together and single duvets. The mattresses were also a lot softer than we're used to although that's down to personal preference.On the first night we were unfortunately kept awake by mosquitoes. That problem was easily solved by keeping the windows closed for the rest of our stay although that meant we were quite warm at night.,

The location was perfect for exploring the city and the house was well equipped. Nadia and Jerry were friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived to the time we left.Bruges is not a cheap city to eat out in so it was great to have a kitchen to cook meals in when we wanted to.",positive
"Reserved, confirmed and paid for room with large double bed, and was given room with two single beds adjacent to each other.,

Location is superb, service is of high quality, excellent value for money",positive
"What can I say.  We had the Junior Suite and it was stunning!  The room and the bathroom were so large.  Not to mention the beautiful decor!  This was the cleanest place we have ever stayed.  Laurent was amazing and always very quick to respond to my messages.  Just a little walk from the canal and a plethora of restaurants to choose from.

Overall was an okay hotel and is located near the atomium.,negative
"getting to the parking was really a hassle. Although it was just steps away from the hotel we had to take the small ring and do a full 360 to get to in. There are 2 entrances and the one in front of the Holiday Inn is super tight fit. We had to inch our way in.And be careful there are 2 holiday inns in the same area : holiday inn and holiday inn express.,

Staff super friendly and helpful. Modern feel in the lobby & eating area. bed was quite comfortable but found the room pretty basic. There was small sitting area and tv with limited channels. Continental breakfast was included and contrary to other hotels, you could still had good selection later in the day!",negative

Really tidy clean and modern. Very very nice to stay at. 
Reception was very helpful and nice. Great solutions for food during these corona times no need to worry.",positive

I was informed if I had the clothes turned into the front desk before 9:00 AM it would be back the next day, well it took 4 days to return,

Friendly service, room service was prompt, clean rooms, food from the bistro was amazing.",positive

Clean",negative
"The only qualm I have is that when I forgot to reserve a time for breakfast, the personnel didn't put in much effort to find a solution. We were happy to sit outside, but they said it's impossible to set it up. How difficult can it be to wipe a table? I was alone with two kids and really would have appreciated a little more forthcoming in this situation.,

The room was great and exceeded my expectations, the breakfast was great, too.",positive
",the coffee machine in the room did not work.. need to be cleaned.",positive
"Absolutely nothing. Everything was great. There is a lot of stairs in the apartment... but gets your steps up! I would highly recommend.,

We arrived in Brugge quite a few hours before the check in time at the hotel and the host Nadia invited us to leave our bags at her shop so that we could explore the area freely, which was most appreciated. She was super friendly and helpful and I couldn't fault her! The location of the shop was easy to get to and Nadia walked us from there to the apartment. She gave us a quick tour and made sure we had everything we needed, even giving us a map and some water. The apartment was in a perfect location, minutes away from shops, restaurants and sights, meaning we could really make the most of our weekend away. It was also really clean, the shower worked perfectly and the beds were extremely comfy.",positive
"Sound insulation could be better as the street noise (police sirens etc) woke us up several times.There is no elevator to the 6th floorBathroom sink is rather low.No street parking in front of the hotel but several parking garages at walking distance,

The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean.Bathroom mirror lights are very goodThe best was the location close to the Christmas markets.Staff was very helpfull and friendly.We received free breakfasts due to a water outage late in the evening",negative

The property was clean and beautiful! The COVID situation doesn’t make it easy but they did the best to make it comfortable for the guests. Too bad I couldn’t try the facilities.
I loved the room and shower! The bed was also great, slept like a baby. No noises in the hallway and dinner was delicious!",positive
Great location. Very clean. Well-equipped kitchen. The host was responsive and nice.,positive

Great breakfast!",positive
"Very loud in the room, hard to sleep,

Close to my destination place",negative
"Due to Corona we were obliged to have breakfast at exactly 11h00. The only other option was to get a breakfast kit and eat it somewhere else. This is totally unexceptable when you have a whole day planned ahead of you and hope to have a good breakfast at the hotel!,

We booked for the Holiday Inn Express. Due to Corona, this hotel is closed and the reservation is changed to the Holiday Inn a few meters further down the road. The Holiday Inn normally is much more expensive, so that was a great upgrade.",negative

"I have already visited about 15 different hotels after the enforcement of the Covid rules. And this is by far the only one where the breakfast is still so rich and enjoyable as before Covid. In this hotel, pre-packed has not meant industrial, lower quality food, but nicely prepared and cooked portions with lots of choice and freshness. 10+ mark for the breakfast.Great bathroom fixtures, stylish, modern  and SOLID, while 80% of hotels seem to have problems with the shower fixtures not holding water or not holding position etc., because when they buy them, they go cheap. Fitness area small but intelligently planned. Very good quality dinner at the hotel restaurant. Lots of parking space, free of charge",positive
"Scraped my ankle on the edge of the tiling in front of the shower. Am nearsighted and the pattern is such that I didn't see the edge. They should put some silicone or something on it,

Comfortable bed, nice big bathroom, great location. I met the owners briefly and they were super helpful. They got a fridge fixed so we could keep perishables in their break room the day we checked out.",positive
"Restaurant was closed all week for the holidays.  Shower bracket incorrectly fitted (room 419) meaning you had to hold it (inconvenient when you're washing your hair).  Terrible noise from slamming room doors (the soft close function had been disabled).,

Well organised for late check-in - ers. 
Free street parking in the area.",positive

The rooms are functional and have everything one needs. The staff is very friendly and the location (between cathedral and yacht harbour) great to explore Hasselt.",positive
"The swimming pool was too crowded and not clean.,

The staff are friendly and the rooms are nice and clean.",positive
"We stayed in room 4 on the 2nd floor and the first 2 nights were amazing, but the last night we noticed so many mosquitos in our room. No idea where they were coming from but we killed so many and caused us not to sleep well. Woke up the next morning with a lot of bites on both my husband and I. I ended going through the reviews and saw that at least 1 other person had the same complaint. Other than the mosquitos, I enjoyed they stay.,

I loved the location and convenience of the property. We parked at the interpark within a 5 minute walk and our room was on the 2nd floor. Stairs were not a problem for us but could be for others, there is no elevator. Our tv worked, A/C worked, and our room was clean. Complimentary water and hairdryer saved the day! There is a great Italian restaurant right next door. I loved how innovative the key pickup and drop off was.",positive
"The night staff was nice and efficient.
But the morning staff was a disaster! I came 10 minutes too late for breakfast. I asked if I could exceptionally get some food from the kitchen, being 8 months 1/2 pregnant. I was simply told first that food had been put away in the kitchen and that it was not possible. Then the lady changed her version saying that they had already thrown away all breakfast, to make sure I would not insist on getting some food I guess...
When I asked if other hotels around would offer some breakfast, she answered that everything was closed by 10am without checking with other hotels. When I told her that I would then have to order a taxi to try and find something in the closest town, she showed absolutely no willingness to help and simply said that this was my only solution.
Good that I went to the nearest hotel, the PentaHotel, where they were serving breakfast until 11.30am and welcomed me in the nicest way.
I will never go back to this hotel for this very reason. Showing no flexibility even when obviously the person needs specific attention is unacceptable.,

Location was practical. Equipments were fairly good and it was clean.",negative
"It was difficult for connecting to public transport.Receptionists is not available during 10:00 am to 3:00 pm and after 8:00 pm in weekends and hence we couldn't get any help .,

The hotel is managing to follow virus-related guidelines very well.",positive

"Only small point of attention are the squeaking doors. Mine was noisy in the bathroom (not neighbor friendly) and also that one of my neighbor. A bit of oil makes the difference. But that is something easy to be solved. Good personnel and a good room where top, so highly recommended.,

Good value for your money. The hotel is in the heart of the city of Hasselt. The room was quiet (which I asked for in advance and received a notification from) and breakfast was very good. The personnel was very hospitable and gave good suggestions on my questions and new the local parking situation (which saved me a lot of mo money, so when arriving by car please ask!). Also I forgot my toothpaste, but that was something they could solve. Sounds like a no brainer to many 'die hard hotel visitors' but to me this made a difference. Also the personnel at the breakfast room were very kind.",positive
"Air conditioning wouldn't chill, only heat. Reported it but was told it only kicks in if its hot, it certainly didn't!,

Friendly staff, looked after us with lunch bags when the restaurant closed due to Coronavirus.",positive
"The closeness of our bed (in room 2) to the door and communal hallway. Due to the position of the fireplace, windows, etc, it would be difficult to move the bed to another position but it meant our heads were only a few metres away from people going up and down the stairs. Other guests were very respectful so we slept well until being woken up by a staff member refilling the coffee and tea cupboard just outside our door at 8am. After 10 minutes or so of trying to ignore her I got up and to let her know that we were trying to sleep. To her credit, she went elsewhere immediately.
I don't believe this would be an issue in other rooms, only room 2. And this was only an issue for us because we were really looking forward to catching up on our sleep and the check out was not until 11am. ,

Everything else was great. I'd certainly stay there again if I could have a different room. The coffee shop across the road did a lovely  breakfast, parking was easy to find, and there was plenty of choice for other meals within 5 minutes walk.",positive
"Good location for those traveling by plane and need to have quick access to the airport.The hotel has a free shuttle service to the airport.",positive
"This time the problem came unexpectedly,1) Some guy could not checked-in due to his payment fail. He had received the email that his payment went wrong but room was still reserved for him. BUT NO ROOM WAS RESERVED, that really awful as the hotel had not took into consideration his own emails. I had the same case several days ago with my payment try was declined. I received the email: 'your payment went wrong but the room was still reserved for you'. If I didn't pay that time, I would have missed my booking as well. It would be a disaster weekend2) The receptionist declined 'late check-out' service for my friends stayed the same hotel, saying they were overbooked. No info about late check-out was about no-possibility to add 'late check-out' option when  you are checking-in3) Room 403 - mini-bar refrigirator is not cooling and remained hot. That made me throw away my salat. It was really unpleasant situationRoom 103 - the sink was blocked and water did not go away easily,

It was not the first time I stayed there, thus I knew what to expect.My previous experience with the hotel went smooth and without any issues.The room was good and matched what I saw in photoalbum. + Thet provide late check-out which was necessary in my case",negative

The host was the friendliest ever. We had a nice stay at the studio.

"Ran out of toilet roll on last evening so had to get paper from downstairs toilet, required to have breakfast (quality inferior compared with Jeanne’s) in another venue on a Monday morning and only found out when we texted to check when we could come down from breakfast. Having an iron and ironing board available would be handy.,

Super cosy boat appartment with great terasse....very friendly and welcoming hoasts,positive
"Marivic and Frederik have given us a wonderful stay. They will do everything to make your stay unforgettable. They took us on their motorboat and even let us drive a motorboat ourselves.  Hospitality is very important to them, which is why they invited us over several times for a nice evening and a delicious Belgian beer (be sure to visit Bierkasteel in Izegem, the beer is super delicious). If you have a car, you can reach a lot of beautiful places in a short time from Izegem. Bruges (was by far the most beautiful place for us, you must have seen it) is only 20-30 minutes away. The beach (we were in Knokke Heist) is only about 40 minutes away. We also visited Lille (a city in France) which was also only half an hour away. Within half an hour we also drove over to the Netherlands (we were there at the beach in Cadzand, also highly recommended). All cities had their own charm and we liked them very much. We felt more than comfortable on their cute and cosy houseboat.",positive
"nothing,

From start to finish, it was amazing. The personal touches and warm reception, the boat ride around the canal and dinner recommendations and company were fantastic.   Frederic and Maricia are amazing.   Ccyling routes are all around and many great routes near Ypres.",positive
"Nothing to dislike !,

Excellent location for hikes and visits, all facilities present (even more than expected, small gifts included), very clean upon arrival. On top of that, Gite Evasion has superfriendly, welcoming hosts who are readily available for help or tips.",positive
"The rooms are either stuffy or noisy (stayed here 2x).  Street-facing rooms are very noisy, most of the night.  Back rooms are stuffy.  No AC and the 'cooling' fan doesn't do much for comfort.,

Location good for some places.  Easy access to metro. Good places to eat nearby.",positive
Very nice homestead near forest and nature. Great amentities and very nice hostess. English is spoken fluently so it is a very easy place to stay and the hostess helps you a lot with information about travelling in Belarus. Great walks are available in the area.,positive

A unique location in a canal barge. Very friendly hosts. Welcome drink on arrival, great breakfast. We stayed here on the last night before Coronavirus closed the country down.",positive

Staff were very helpful and the location of hotel was very central",positive
"Can't really point any negative things about the place.,

We really liked our stay there. There are lots of places to visit nearby including famous lakes of Naroch. Irina was very nice and answered all our questions about where to go and gave us all the required directions. She is an excellent cook and served us great lunch, breakfast, and dinner all from the natural ingredients.The room was very comfortable. Last but not least - although the house is located in a quiet place it's easy to get to the town of Naroch (about 10 min drive by car) with all the stores and restaurants.",positive

"Everything was perfect.,

""Simplement impeccable"". Un grand merci à Claude et Roxana.",positive
"We visited during a heat wave and the room was uncomfortably hot. They placed a portable fan in the room and provided us with bottles of water but it was still difficult to comfortably sleep or rest in the room. One side of the room was French doors that faced the afternoon sun so while we’d be out the room just turned into a hot box even if we closed the blinds and curtains to stop it a little. It eventually would cool off once the sun went down, but again it’s summer so this happened late. ,

The lobby and rooms were beautifully decorated. The bed was comfortable (on the soft side). Only hanging space for those who like to unpack during their stay. Breakfast each morning was nice. Included bread, meats and cheeses, scrambled eggs, yogurts and granola. The breakfast room was small but we never had to struggle to find a place to sit. Short walk to the metro and Grand Place.",positive
"Unmatched quality of sleep. Overall comfort and quite surroundings. Long walks among pine trees. Deers in the forest. Getting there may be a bit tricky as it is far from the center, but there is no other way to meet the nature anyway - just take taxi.",positive
"Personally no complains,

Breakfast and location, and I like Van der Valk Hotels :)",positive
"Quiet neighbourhood, beautiful view, quite close to the bus station and close to the Atomium, I would say it was a 20 minutes walk away from the Atomium.The room was better than shown in the pictures and super clean. The bed was comfortable. We appreciated the express check-in service, because we arrived late at night, around 12 PM and we were able do to the check-in ourselves and go to our room.",positive
"i didnt like the bed. it was 2 bed become 1  when i specifically put one bed in the app. ,

it was near the city and the receptionist is very attentive to what you asked her. Breakfast was superb.",positive
The owners are very friendly and charming. They went out of their way to make us welcome. Their hospitality was amazing giving us a small cruise in their small outboard boat and providing a delicious fresh breakfast. Thank you Marie-Vic and Fredèric,positive
"Nothing,

Everything -  it’s a beautiful apartment, well equipped and comfortable. Host Claude & Roxanne we’re very friendly and even provided us with a bottle of bubbly and chocolates on arrival. Good quality fixtures especially in the kitchen and bathroom. A beautiful private garden with furniture and BBQ also there for our use after our days out. Great base for exploring this area, shops restaurants etc a short drive away so probably need a car to get the most from your stay.Would definitely stay here again if returning to this part of Belgium.",positive
"Cost of breakfast is really high. There is a off smell inside the room when we entered. But after staying in it for a while it wasn't there anymore.,

Location is really good. Near to many restaurants & metro.",positive
"The only thing I could regret is the price, a bit expensive for our budget, but it was no surprise. I just want to tell travelers to count the different extra prices in their budget : dinner, breakfast, sauna... everything is perfect so you will want to try everything and that will grow the bill !Also, no options for vegans BUT Irina is so cool I am pretty sure you just have to tell before you come.,

The place was perfect, real Russian sauna with a small river nearby, adorable dogs, extra comfy room, delicious food... and, most importantly, Irina, who welcomed us, is an amazing person, so interesting, funny and warm.Her English is perfect (she is a translator) which was very appreciable during a trip in a country where nobody understood us.We had a long trip driving all around Belarus and this stay was a well-appreciated pause.",positive
"The bathroom and the room were clean but a little old.,

The restaurant  and the breakfast are more than average.",positive
"there are a wedding in the same building of the hotel , the music during all the night until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning , we can't sleep never because of this , and we were obliged to dont go in the morning to work . we pass a horrible night , i am going to ask my money back. !!,

the room is clean and the man in the reception so nice and helpful .",negative
"Rooms noisy. Could overhear the neighbor on the phone and follow complete conversation.
Breakfast too standard and cheap",negative
"The hospitality. The hospitality that the hosts showed us during out stay was second to none. We arrived after the latest scheduled arrival time for 10pm but they were still there to greet us when we arrived and even invited us over to share a beer. They were informative on the area, offering us a lot of great ideas for planning out our next few days of activities, and the next day when we ran into trouble in Bruges they were quick to offer us a helping hand that turned a miserable night into a memorable one. The room itself was fantastic as well and very unique. A cozy cabin on a boat with all the amenities you could need. The terrace above was fantastic for a late night beer while looking at the stars, soaking up the sun during the day, or for more a morning coffee looking out over the canal.  I could not recommend the Spits-Lucie B&B enough. If you are staying in the area and looking for a unique place to stay with great personality then this is it.",positive
"It was pretty hot and our room only had a portable air conditioning. I believe that might be troublesome in the peaks of summer. ,

Great location, super nice staff.",positive
"I missed the possibility to have a snack or light meal during lunchtime in the hotel , but the friendly lady at the reception could order something if we were interested, and in a 2 min. walking distance there was possibility to eat or buy a snack.,

Staff at reception and breakfast/ diner very friendly and competent , relaxing atmosphere .Room was ok, all we needed was there .",positive
"Jacuzzi didn’t work fully - jets were out-of-order,

High ceilings, friendly site managers, big bed",positive
"Can't think of anything!,

Great stay at Hotel Malleberg.  The location is exceptional, only steps away from the major Markt and Burg squares.  The manager went out of his way to make it a great visit and was very helpful with suggestions of things to do in the area.  The breakfast was delicious with many choices and lots of great fruit, yogurt, breads, meats, and cheeses.  The Family Room was even larger than expected - actually was two rooms connected by a private hallway with a toilet room and shower/bath room in between - and could easily fit two couples or a full family quite comfortably.  I also thought the price was quite reasonable for such a large room in such a great location.",positive
"Beautiful location and the host Irina is such a nice person, felt like staying at home. Fantastic breakfast, prepared with ❤️❤️❤️, thank you!",positive
"Steady light noise from the ventilation system in the night,

Great breakfast, wonderful view, strategic location",positive
"The appartement is very big, comfy and neat. We were lucky enough to have the accommodation all to ourselves. The check-in was smooth and the host respected our privacy.  The bubble bath is a nice and luxurious addition, would’ve been nicer if there would’ve been some candles. It’s just our personal preferences though.",positive

"Frederik and Marivic are the best hosts you could ask for! So so friendly, welcoming, informative and fun. The Spits-Lucie is an amazing place to stay, something a bit different with an interesting story of how it came to be as it is today. Went with wife and two teenage kids and were very comfortable. Beers, insight into the life of working barges and boat trip to local market were just the best unexpected extras! Came away glowing, honestly cannot recommend highly enough.",positive
"Location is good, very clean and friendly staff.",positive
"It was cold in the hotel. The room temperature could not be raised. Even the reception staff had runny nose due to the low inside temperature. The rooms should be repainted. The bathroom requires complete renovation. Carpets are dirty and old.,

Extra location, normal breakfast.",negative
"We were the only guests (COVID!) but I suspect the building may be a bit noisy (creaky floors etc) when other guests are there. This would personally not bother me, but might be good to know if you are a light sleeper.,

Beautiful, huge room/suite with jacuzzi in the bathroom. The bed was big en very comfortable. The neighbourhood has many many restaurants to take-away food (and have dinner in regular times, I suspect) and in the shared kitchen there are glasses/cutlery etc. The TV had Netflix, which was nice as well. Good breakfast as well, especially seeing that they had to organise it just for us.",positive
"With a great location parking was a 5 minute walk. There is parking in front of hotel to drop bags off with a half an hour stay limit. This meant that for us it was not a big deal. Secure parking is around 11 euros per day.,

Friendly staff, clean and great location. Good COVID measures. Bar next door serves food until late also. Tried number of other hotels but this one replied quickly and politely. Very good value for money. Breakfast was very plentiful and I am sure in non Covid times would be even better",positive

I did not like anything about this hotel!",negative

Very strange for 4 star hotel.Very narrow beds and narrow blanket.Sent an enquiry via booking.com but never got a response.,

Very good location - 7 mins of walk from Brussels nord train station. Can get direct bus from Brussels airport and bus stop is just 50 m away (bus 272 - just 3 euro).Shopping street is just across the road. Walking distance to all main attractions.",positive

Bathroom very tired, black stains between tiles although it looked clean and tidy. Very clean bed sheets but found hair. Lots of noise all night long from the corridor.,

"Some noise from the bar across the street. I couldn't close the one window completely.
Only 1 chair in the room.
If you take a bath it's kind of slippery,

I want to say a huge thanks to Anna! I asked her if we could have a room with a balcony and good view, so she kindly gave us the room 403. The balcony was tiny but cute, and the view was more than AMAZING. I was happy and thankfull to Anna every day for that! 
Really close to Grand Place, shops and café/bars (5-10mins). The room was very clean also!

There was one in the bathroom but It didn’t work so that was really disappointing since that was the only reason to be there. Later I was looking at google reviews and saw someone with the same complaint and this review was from more than 5 months ago and yet, now, 5 months later it was still not working.,

Big room with a big comfortable bed and a tv with netflix and amazone prime.",negative
"The owners were extremely welcoming and pleasant very informative and helpful. Our rook was spacious and nicely decorated with a nice comfy bed and adjustable radiator in the room (it got chilly at night but the radiator was a little too warm when we got there so it was nice to be able to adjust it).

The location is good, ideal for a walk in the city centre. Good breakfast. I had the feeling it wasn't that much clean",negative
"I got a room on the first floor, which was rather dark and looked out into a tiny brick yard with light coming from way up only. The room was clean and spacious but some details were not great, for example the plug did not fit the bath, there were some chips off the tiles. I didn't have breakfast as I thought it was a little expensive. The price was very high, but this was the same for all Brussels hotels that night owing to an international football match.,

Location is perfect for central Brussels, with 10 min walk from the Central station.",negative

"The single room seemed really spacious, but as it’s located right under the gable roof  it only offers about 1.5m standing space in the middle, left and right from there I banged my head at least five times against the ceiling. The douche is separated on a lower floor.,

Located in a quiet area, private parking space, very friendly and helpful owner. Everything is superclean. There’s a private kitchen at your diposal and some bio stuff in the fridge.",positive

Everything was excellent

"The location, we ended up having to walk extremely far. There is a bus but the driver drove past every stop before you could read what it was causing us to miss it. There wasn’t any A/C so we had to sleep with the windows open which meant all the noise from the street kept us up.  
Overall was a pretty decent stay and definitely would have liked to have been there longer,

Spacious room and super comfortable bed, the shower was also really good. It had a clothesline over the bath with was super handy.

I couldn't sleep for one night because half the next room beside us the customers was very loud with sex... the lady was screaming all through the night or throughout the mornings with the loud music as well.. that was not comfortable..,

Great Staff!!",positive
"Although it is connected by the public transportation, albeit with around 10 minutes walking distance to the station, the hotel is quite far from the city center. The reception is available only for a limited time. The room I was given was too clasic for Brussels. It smelled very strong badly that somewhat seemed to be of a kind of air fresher to make the smell of the room manageable. This is not the kind of smell many visitors would like to have. I found it terrible. The room was also too hot to manage sleeping. I used it for a short night sleep. Even though, especially the first night, given a combination of heat and smell, i had a terrible sleep. There were no tea or coffee. The mattress was of a low quality. The sink of the shower was already half blocked and it was struggling to take a shower.,

It should be remembered, however, that the room was not dirty.",negative
Sofa bed was not made up on arrival (although the lovely receptionist solved this quickly for us) and that bed was very uncomfortable. Kept banging legs on the metal outer structure which was above the height of the thin mattress. Not what I would expect for £130/night.,positive
"The only bad thing about the hotel is that it’s on a busy street with a lot of bars and is noisy throughout the night. ,

The location of this hotel is brilliant - 5 mins walk from the Grand Place and a lot of popular tourist spots like Manekin-Pis, chocolate museum and famous bars. There is also a metro/tram station less than 5 minutes walk away where you can travel to some places a little further out. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was a nice size, modern and very clean.",positive
"The hotel is in the heart of Brugge, superlative position.
The style of the hotel is a little bit “old style” but very consistent with the environment. Overall good solution, maybe a little bit expensive considering the the structure (the service is super, the man at the reception is very kind a helpful).",positive
"Great location- this hotel is barely a 5 min walk to the Brussels North train station, which makes it very easy to do day trips to Bruges and Antwerp, etc. The hotel and room were clean and the staff were helpful. I highly recommend staying here, great value for your money.",positive
"Absolutely NOTHING,

Everything was beyond my expectations.. Exceptionally Clean, Neat and Tidy..  In this summer A/C was superb. Super Comfy Bed and Pillows.
Would absolutely visit again. Free parking was great too..",positive
"I loved it ,

Clean nd spacious.. just like a 3* hotel",positive
"Discovered what other reviewers meant when they said it was hard to find this place due to one way system.  There were 3 of us in car navigating using both car Satnav and google maps on phone, but stymied by ongoing roadwork disruptions.   In the end we ditched the car somewhere near enough to hotel and walked, got map & instructions from hotel staff about how to find the underground parking.  Thankfully didn’t get parking ticket meantime. Could do with some better access instructions when booking.,

Good value place to stay. Beds comfy. Clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Nearby underground parking cost 2 euros per hour (1 euro per hr evening) up to maximum 16 euros within 24 hrs.",positive
"Single room doesn't have a safe and beneath the bed in my room was extremely dusty.Noise from the road at night makes it very difficult to sleep.Beds aren't comfortable.,

"n/a,

The whole stay was just amazing. The food, the room, sleep quality and customer service was above my expectations.This is a hotel that I will keep returning to and recommend to my friends.",positive
"The parking costs € 19, but if you drive to the streets in the area, you should be able to find a spot, at least in my case it was quite easy. Just bear in mind that you need to either leave before 9 or pay in the machine the charge for the next morning, until the time you stay, otherwise you could be fined.,

The hotel is in the centre of Hasselt, walking distance to the nice area of restaurants and bars, Hasselt has a great atmosphere. The hotel is good and a nice place to stay for the night.",positive
"I missed bath, because I expected it (it was in descrip tion and photos), but otherwise very nice. A few holes in the tovels, but otherwise not problematic. Elevator made problematic noises, that’s why I rather avoided it.,

The area is great. The breakfast is awesome . 🤩🤩🤩",negative
"Shower doors leaking externally into the floor stand area but not very important. Only a note for consideration.,

Restaurant arrangement for both meal and breakfast was excellent. The set-up, the space, the cleanliness, the service and the staff were very all top mark. the housekeeping, cleanliness specially during current Covid-19 was exemplary.I will certainly come back again or use this hotel chain in other countries. Well done!",positive
"The staff during check-in (John) was very unfriendly, sometimes even arrogant. He spoke to us in a highly unprofessional matter (""ha, that's no proof, everyone can show me something like that!"" when he couldn't find our booking in the system and I showed him the booking confirmation). He also addressed us inappropriately (e.g. ""Menneke""). We really didn't feel welcomed at the property.,

Property itself was OK with good value for money. Overall we didn't spend too much time in the hotel as we arrived late at night, immediately went to bed and left directly in the morning.",negative

"The hotel is excellent and we can think of nothing negative to say.,

Me and my wife have just stayed three nights at Hotel Malleberg and had a wonderful time. The hotel is situated in a fantastic location just a short walk from the historic centre, the shopping areas, and the Christmas markets were only a few minutes away. The hotel has a lovely basement which is the breakfast area, and the breakfast food was certainly plenty to keep us going for the morning. The rooms are of a decent size, importantly very warm for the time of year and the bed was very comfortable. The owners are very friendly and helpful and told us of local interests to visit also we received two vouchers for a free boat trip because we stayed for three nights.",positive
"The equipment of the room did not fully correspond to the description. Especially  accessories in the bathroom corresponded more for 2star hotel. The towels, no bathfoam, only one shower gel in a big flask..... The fasade  and surrounding of the hotel was under reconstrution.,

The breakfest was really exceptional, so many varieties of hight quality food and drinks. Nice atmosphere. Staff tried to be helpfull. The hotel is close to the public transportation stations - metro, bus, even railwaystation.",negative
"Nothing 10/10 all round,

Food excellent   Location ideal",positive
"It has been a fantastic stay. The whole house has been freshly renovated, my room was spacious with a shower and a bath, a coffee machine, a wooden floor and beautiful decorations.

"Fantastic place, wonderful location, great breakfast & a warm welcome. We'll be back!",positive
"The lobby was under renovation which although did not impact our trip, it was a bit off-putting when we arrived as did not know how this would impact the room. Some warning of the renovation would have been appreciated. Thankfully the renovations did not impact the room.,

Very good room, clean, spacious and comfortable.",positive

"We liked everything about B&B 11 Exclusive Guesthouse.,

We loved everything about B&B 11 Exclusive Guesthouse.  The location was close to the main square and easy to get to.  My husband and I stayed in the 1st floor suite.  It had a separate entrance, living room, small kitchen, large bedroom and bathroom.  It was extremely clean and the hosts of the B&B were wonderful.  We enjoyed breakfast each morning and great conversation with other guest.  The host of the B&B provided great instruction on what to do and see along with options for restaurants.  The next time we visit Brugge we will definitely stay at B&B 11.",positive
"Pillows for your beds are cushions leading to a very uncomfortable sleep.
They're having renovation works but we were not told beforehand at any time.
Noisy from all the renovation works.
We felt like we were in the way of the workmen and unsure if the kitchen was still operational. ,

Incredible location.
Staff were friendly.",positive
Stairs were a bit dangerous,positive
"Stated that parking was available nearby which was actually street parking around the corner but the host kindly allowed us to use his local parking permit. ,

Walking distance to Grote market and Cloth Hall. B&B is located on the third level accessed by a narrow staircase so our heavy suitcases stayed downstairs in the main house. We were given the keys and due to host working we were given free reign and didn’t actually meet. But a friend warmly greeted us in his behalf and kindly prepared breakfast for us before she left for work which was delicious! Lived the eclectic collection of vintage items and the room was tastefully decorated with plenty of tourist brochures available.",positive
"Some furniture is a bit worn out and the bathroom need proper door (instead of the curtain).,

We liked that the door had a code and it was easy to enter and leave the apartment. Also, the host left clear instructions how to use everything in the apartment. The apartment was fully equipped and clean. The location is in the city centre, close to many shopping and dining places. The metro stop is just a few minutes away on foot.",positive

Amazing place to stay x,positive
"Firstly the bed’s mattress was soo bad, u will suffer while sleeping. Secondly,  noises outside were soo annoying specially during the day if u would like to have a nap. Thirdly, during our stay which was 3 nights no one changed our bed sheets and pillows and it was dirty and need to be changed.,

Location was great and the stuff were good. I would recommend the location.",negative
"Nothing to mention!,

First of all I want to mention that Gaston is the best host we’ve ever seen. When we entered the apartment it was warm, because they waited for us. Thank you so much, it was so nice!
Th guesthouse is cosy, well furnished and has all the necessary stuff. The spacious bathroom with shower and bath was always clean. 
Breakfast was delicious, especially scrambled eggs which were prepared for every guest individually. 
The location is great, you are in the very center of the city. 
I really suggest that you visit this fabulous place!",positive

"nothing,

Everything was just as you'd expect it: location, room, great breakfast. We had the perfect spot for our weekend getaway!",positive
"The apartment is clean and spacious, but you need to complete some shortcomings and care, such as shelves in bathrooms and hangers.  Some of the basics for the kitchen, maintenance of bathroom floor, changing pillows for the bed, setting a table beside the bed and lighting in the bedroom, in general the apartment is good and I would recommend living in it.,

-Excellent shopping site.
-Cleanliness.",positive

Very well located comfortable property.  Staff was exceedingly personable.,positive
"The size of the room is really small, even the toilet is small too. The shower room is the only normal size in my room. ,

The girl in the reception, when we chick in. She was friendly, helpful, respectful, and so kind. The hotel’s location is great as it is in the heart of everything. The hotel’s lobby is under renovation but do not worry. I really loved my stay there",positive
"Cherry on the cake would be tea and coffee facilities in the room.,

Excellent location.  Rooms lovely, clean and spacious. Excellent breakfast with a wide choice.  Superb host, very friendly and accommodating, with lots of advice about the area....will be back.",positive
The apartment exceeded our expectations. It has all the basic needs and essentials. We didn't want to eat out as much cause of the pandemic and it was acutally quite nice to eat at the apartment since it looks really nice. Communication with Patricia went smoothly.,positive
"Not having a shower option. There is a hand shower in bath. ,

Being able to have a bath.",positive
"There are several cupboards, even tailor-made, however, in none is a fridge to be found. With regard to the marvelous beer and delicious food, this would be definitely nice to have. But as I said: ""nice to have"", not dramatically necessary. // We have indeed experienced the noise that was described in earlier reviews. Some young folks gathered in front of our window, on the little square. However, we were able to talk to the guys and they became consequently more quiet. Keep that in mind, guess it'll help. ,

Actually, we liked pretty much everything about our stay in Bruges at Chester. The location is superb in that you don't need to walk far in order to explore the city. The appartement is exactly as the pictures have suggested. No concerns regarding covid19, everything has be arranged perfectly, even hand sanitizer was provided. Check-in was smooth and contactless. Stairs may be too steep for elderly people, but there's also a certainly nice place to stay on the ground floor. Daily housekeeping was alright.",positive

"Public parking,

Bikes were very good.",positive
"No negatives,

"Nothing really, I found everything fine.,

The breakfast that Erick served every morning was tasty and there was plenty of it.",positive
"There was quite a lot of noise from the street, the stairs and the door of the B&B which sadly is the case for many hotels in cities. The bathroom was a little bit smelly. Breakfast was served by a different person every morning and although everyone was polite, it felt a little bit impersonal. ,

The B&B is overall beautifully decorated and our suite on the ground floor was very spacious and very pretty. The fireplace was simply amazing and created a romantic atmosphere in the room! The honesty bar was very well equipped and prices were very reasonable. The breakfast has a lot of variety and it was quite tasty.",positive
"The facilities are excellent and Serge is absolutely an excellent host. The breakfast was extraordinary, very complete and burgundy! We stayed one night with our two kids (3yrs & 1yr) and were able to go out for a drink in the bar closeby (200m), while the kids were sleeping. Parking and electric charging in front of Lunatree",positive
"So first, Peter his really nice!So welcoming, available and friendly, always there to help or give some good advice to visit the area 😊👌The situation of the appartement is really easy, not more than 6min by bicycle from the building to the beach.(and we can borrow the bike from Peter which is amazing!) And also near to all supermarket, shopping and the train station.But it's really a quiet place, and also not far from The Zwin. Inside everything is clean, the mattress is comfortable, and we had all we need.We gonna keep the address for sure! :)",positive
"It is not that I didn't like it but the rooms could use a little bit of an update.  Newer carpet & furniture would be nice.  But it was still a nice room.,

The hotel is very nice & clean.  The lobby area is more up-to-date than the rooms but the overall experience was nice.  The staff was so friendly & went out of the way to help you.  The location of the hotel is within walking distance to take public transportation.  We were very satisfied with choosing the Van der Valk hotel in Antwerpen.  We did not eat in the restaurant so I do not have a comment regarding the food, etc.",positive
"The sofa bed wasn't comfortable. The 2nd room by the stairs has little light. The shower can't be locked and has frosted glass, which can make it uncomfortable when you're staying with friends of the opposite sex since you can see it from the 1st room. Wifi in the room does not work, but we can still access wifi from the lounge.,

Location is great. Walking distance from the metro and the Grand Place. There are also restaurants and shops nearby. Lay out of the apartment is simple and yet functional. Minimalist yet modern.The lounge is also accessible. You can leave your luggage if you arrive earlier or leave later. They are also friendly and can speak English fluently.",positive

Next day 2nd request. Told someone will come next day. 
Told could use office fridge.

"I think a small scale boutique hotel should be able to provide non plastic free products, something more ecological. For example portioned jams and butter, plastic coffee capsules & plastic bottles water.  I would prefer to see more care and thought in this area.,

The bed was super comfy and a big bathbforn2 that fills up rather quickly. And as we had the suite we had a private entrance.",positive
"The lobby is under construction and they didn't inform before check in.,

Location",positive
"The location is excellent, only 5 minutes walk to the main square and Christmas market. The facilities are excellent and very comfortable... The property owner is very friendly and always on hand if you need anything. On arrival he showed us key points on the map and recommended walks to take. Having stayed at the Guesthouse Mirabel I wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Bruges.",positive
"Nothing negative: I wish I could have stayed longer!,

The apartment was modern, stylishly furnished, well eqipped, super clean, great shower!Perfect location: Apartment is located in the centre of Aywaille easy walking distance to restaurants, train station, and supermarkets.Patricia is a very gracious and friendly host who goes to great trouble to help her guests.",positive
"The reception when we arrived was lacking hospitality. We were not greeted by the desk, we were asked for the cards immediately. Then, the amount that we were asked to pay was higher than the price. Even though we made it clear that the booking was through booking.com, the receptionist told us to pay the price. Without any further explanation, we were told that they would charge us some extra money just for 'deposit'.  We only learned this, that they would pay the card after the check out, after we asked several times. It would be better to give the information, the reason for the extra payment and other details before trying to charge the guests extra for no apparent reason. Even though the room was almost exactly the same as in the photos, the number of the plugs and the placements of them were really odd. There was no plug next to the bed, not anywhere accessible. Even the coffee machine, which was placed by the hotel itself, was unplugged because there was no plug available. Lastly, the lockers in the sauna were all broken/not usable. There was almost no instructions on how to use the lockers and we had to leave our belongings without locking them.,

Location of the hotel was really good, it has easy access to metro and walking distance to the city center. It's very close to the train station (Gare du Nord), which is another good point. The neighborhood was also good, there were few supermarkets, cafes and restaurants if you don't want to go to city center just to eat. The view of the room was nice at the 17th floor, even though we did not book for the room with the city view. The sauna was really good and had an awesome view.",positive
"It wasn’t a problem for us, but just be aware that there is no elevator & the stairs are steep.,

The location was fantastic!  The husband & wife owners were both very pleasant & helpful to us, especially with restaurant recommendations. They also accommodated our travel plans by allowing an early check-in. In addition, the husband carried our heavy suitcases up the stairs for us to our room. The room was small, as expected, but it had everything we needed. A good value for the money.",positive
"very warm upstairs in the bedrooms (airco will be installed late ‘20). 
the noise of the motorway that runs 200m behind the house is quite noticeable when sitting in the garden. The house itself is very well insulated, no noise noticeable.
,

clean and newly renovated house with lots of amenities located in a residential neighborhood. very friendly and hospitable owner with an eye for detail. 20minutes from maastricht and 10 min from historical center of Rekem with nice restaurants (by car). supermarket at 500m from the house.",positive

Breakfast was fab - lots of variety, fresh & plenty of it, even a glass of bubbly too.  Our suite was beautiful, the fire was just what was needed after a cold day & the shower was fantastic.

Serge was a friendly and generous host who provided an abundant breakfast tailored to our wishes.,positive
"We only missed a kettle for making a cup of tea. Also the breakfast did not meet our expectations at all. We are used to Van der Valk in the Netherlands where the choice is almost endless. Also the fish in the restaurant comes with way too much oil on the plate.,

"The room we stayed in was excellent, the only draw back was the steep stairs.,

The breakfast was lovely, plenty to choose from, even offered a glass of Champagne with it. The location was perfect, close to the market and the many shops. We would recommend the B&B Chester and would certainly return if we came to Bruges again",positive

"Nothing.,

The breakfasts were quite tasty as well as being filling; there was no scrimping on either quality or quantity of food.  We were also welcome to use the kitchenette (microwave, refrigerator and kettle), dining area and soft chair area at any time.  And it was very nice to have a bedroom for that could be darkened completely.",positive
"Beautiful little place, perfect location and friendly staff.",positive
"Anything said I didn’t like would be just because it does not everything I have at home. Perhaps soft drinks in the fridge, but that is a minor thing.,

Fantastic B&B in great location. Wonderful decoration and furnishings. I must admit I did not know what to expect from the Japanese style bed but it was really comfortable. Welcome was outstanding and breakfast was just what I needed to start the day with both hot and cold options.",positive

The room rate included breakfast which we were told could not be provided due to renovations at the property. Pillows are awful.,

Rooms are clean and modern. Good location, easy walking distance to shops and Grand Place. Close to transport services and the Eurostar station is less than ten minutes by car. Staff were very helpful and apologetic about the renovations/lack of breakfast.",negative

The place offers a lot of space comparing to local hotels. It is one floor in a town house with restored original features which gives you that lovely feel of authenticity. It is very close to centre so in walking distance you may get to local restaurants. The host is one of the most lovely and hospitable people I have ever met and would go miles to make your stay as per expectations. Can't recommend enough and if it is available next time I'm in Mechelen, I shall certainly try to come back, even if just to have a chat with Serge!",positive

The breakfast buffet was very complete, although I was expecting some fresh cut fruit.,

The hotel rooms were renovated with very simple yet modern furniture.

Compensation was free breakfast. Next morning, no water on top floor, clearly a pressure problem, new receptionist had no cloe, ""new problem, never had complaints"". Then he wanted us to pay for breakfast :(  I'm not a complainer but this was bad! Do not get fooled by rating...hotel without a soul, and nobody who takes responability for it.,

Superb location, wonderful host and comfy rooms.",positive
"During our stay we found the beds to be a bit uncomfortable however you do get use to it and it was annoying having construction works next door but they were pretty good with only making noise when allowed. ,

This property is in an excellent location...so close to the Notting Hill Gate station (just across the road) and near many supermarkets. It was great of Leonard to provide us with an upgrade to enjoy our two week stay better and the daily service of our room was good.",positive

Breakfast and dinner were outstanding.The room was big and clean.",positive
"I choose this smartflat because we were in three people and there was 2 double beds and a sofa bed (we did not want to share beds). When I arrive there isnt any sheet or blanket for sofa bed and when I call to smartflat central requesting it they said it was cost extra 25 euros. At the time,because I did not have to book another hotel I agree with extra cost but if you are going to book this flat it is better to verify all things included before go. It was assumed by flat that we were going to share beds but none of us were a couple so this extra charge should not be done,

Good Location",positive

"There was nothing I can think of that I would say was a bad experience at all!,

The breakfast was amazing and Gaston even cooked us eggs to order.   The chocolate croissants were fresh and heavenly.   We were able to store our bikes near the entrance of the hotel so going around the town was extremely easy and convenient.  Great location to see Bruges!",positive

"A beautiful place - conveniently located, cosy, and comfortable. Would love to have stayed longer.",positive
Staff friendly and professional at all times.  Convenient overnight stay.,positive
"Quite a lot of noise from the busy street and upstairs neighbour moving around. The sofa bed wasn't comfortable to sit on, there could be more and more comfortable seating. Some fixtures and lamps in the bathroom were broken, little storage in the bedroom and bathroom. Stingy with the paper-thin pillows and duvet, would be good to have an extra one.,

Hassle-free self check-in with a code, no need to make arrangements and time your arrival or stress when delayed. Downtown location, very central to shops, bars and restaurants. Very spacious and clean. Very good heating and great water pressure which helps to shower the cold away.",positive
"The bed was quite uncomfortable as were the pillows. Perhaps if a mattress topper was added to the double bed (which is two single units put together - very common and necessary in these old houses with steep stairs! Almost impossible to install a double bed) and larger pillows provided we would have had a most restful break. ,

Really loved the location, tucked away from the hustle and bustle but close to the city centre and attractions. Staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was really lovely.",positive

"Erik and Rosita were fantastic hosts and very nice people. Great accommodation with a very comfy bed. Amazing breakfast with everything fresh - fresh fruit, fresh orange juice, fresh selection of bread and pastries with ham and cheese. We cycled the 30 mile Peace Route and there was no need for lunch after such a massive breakfast! You would be crazy not to book this B&B!",positive
"Nothing to say here,

Everything about this place was beyond anything I’ve expected - couldn’t be located more centrally and yet in a quiet square so you don’t get any main street noise; the amenities and the room itself were incredibly high standard, clean and well thought through. And the breakfast... I have no words, we were in heaven!! Overall, I will never look at any other place to stay when in Bruges.",positive

He suggested us to visit Bruges where the place leave the most memorable and enjoyable stay in Belgium. Hotel is in good size and comfortable.

Highly recommend!",positive
"We realy enjoyed our stay. Perfect location, lovely breakfast and coffee, friendly staff. Brugge is very calm and romantic place. We highly recommended for couples and families. :)",positive
"There was nothing we didn’t liked. ,

Friendly, clean, spacious, comfortable great breakfast. If you take the two rooms you have the whole apartment to yourself. Great for friends or a family travelling together",positive
"Soundproofing from room to room is not good at all. You can hear just about everything the upstairs neighbor is doing in his room. In fact, it is clear that this B&B was installed in an old building (which makes it even more charming), but the lack of a better acoustic privacy really complicates things a bit.,

Almost everything. From the great breakfast (the owner even offered us a glass of champagne in the morning that we checked out) to the room itself (witch has an ultra comfy bed and a great shower, what is rare in Europe), this B&B could be rated as a 5-star. Everything is well-cared, the decor is really tasteful and the crew makes everything to make you feel comfort. Also, the location is more than anyone could ask for: a few steps away from the main street and the main square, but in an incredibly quiet and reserved street.",positive

"- The sound of restoration work.
- Our view was awful. We watched a construction.
- The room is too little.
- We experienced our the worst parking process. The name of park house is Indigo. I paid totally 36 Euros for two days and after I wanted to drive out. We jammed in front of the exit by car because the parking ticket did not function although we paid. With the help of construction workers, I reached the authorized person. They told that I have to pay. I told that i had already paid. By the way, to pay with cash is not possible and there is no any receipt which indicates that you paid. Fortunately we logged in our bank account and we showed the transaction information. Afterwards the authorize person told that I did not drive out in 50 minutes. Fortunately there is also a time which shows when you paid. It was not even 20 minutes. When I was alright then she couldn't have found any other excuse and has given us an another ticket to drive out. 
- In the parking garage, the ceiling is to low so watch out when you open your baggage door.
- Parking places are too narrow. I lost at least 5 minutes to be able to find a suitable place to fit my long and wide car.
,

- Breakfast is very nice.
- The reception welcomed us warmly.
- There is a fitness studio at the top of the building with a nice city view.
- The location is indescribable. You can reach wherever you want by walking. Everything is almost around the hotel.
- The room was clean and there was a coffee machine.
- They put 2 bottle of waters in the minibar for free every day.",positive

"The place is a gem. Erik and his wife Rosita are so helpful and friendly and the place is spotless. I have never had a breakfast to rival the one offered by these two people. The accomodation is very comfortable, and positively brimming with quality. I would recommend B & B Fresco to anyone. Pet friendly and so well positioned for Ypres centre-it could hardly be rivalled! We will be going back! Thank you!",positive
The coziest B&B in the heart of Bruges! Well decorated with an amazing included breakfast.,positive
"It’s not very close to the city center but it’s not also extremely far. ,

Modern, clean, comfortable room. Delicious breakfast. Great place to have a coffee/something to eat on the ground floor. On top of that I enjoyed the sauna and swimming pool. I can recommend this place :)",positive
"There was no selective waste bins at the apartments! We suggest you put the same model of bins you have in your lounge area, with normal plastic bags so that cleaning staff can handle them safely and put everything already sepparated in the final municipality bags at the street. This would be more in line with Smartflats modernity and send a message that Smartflats are environmentaly friend apartments (Ence more ""smart"").If you put a small table or support for suitcases at the bedrooms, plus some hangers, that would add some more confort.,

Kitchen and eating area big, practical and nice. Lots of space. Confortable linen in the beds. Nice and attentive staff. Very close to central attractions. Probably the best racio quality/price in Brussels for a group stay of several days!",positive
"It was absolutely perfect. The room is beautifully decorated, so much attention to detail. Even though you are only a 5 minute walk away from some of the main attractions, it is completely quiet. The garden is a hidden gem. The hostess was extremely kind and helpful. I can highly recommend this guest house.",positive

Rather a lot of noice in the corridors,negative
"I smelled  pillows like sweat . The room has no AC,  so   I slept window open.,

This apartment is in center of city ,so I could easily move everywhere and come back to the apartment to take a rest.I can use wash machine and cooker by reading a manual. when I came to the hotel, I couldn`t open the door ,but  the stuff supported soon.The room was wide and feld comfortably.",positive
"There is a fairly strong smell which comes from the bathroom downstairs, there are plenty of ways this could be addressed so it should be.There were also stains on the throw on the end of the bed which were not subtle stains, they were quite obvious,

The location of the hotel is amazing. Right off many of the most important streets and very close to the center.",negative
"when I came there, it had some repaired structure, so a little difficult to find the way come in when we go to Brussels first times,

This hotel near the station, so it very convenient. Also it does not take long time to go to city center and it seemly quite, it's good for staying.",positive

Nice bedrooms with comfortable beds",negative
"Have to use key card in order to turn on power - this makes recharging any batteries while out impossible. I wouldn't want to spend more than 1 night here (which is all I spent), found the room cramped.,

Travelled to Ypres with my 19 yr old son to experience the War graves, Menin Gate last post & the general surroundings. B&B Fresco was a great choice & perfect for what we wanted.",positive
"We liked the convenience of this location in proximity to the shops and main square.  The property is decorated in a clean, modern chic with relaxing earth tone colors and tasteful furnishings and artwork.  Stephanie rode her bike to the property to meet us and explain the key system, etc. in a timely manner.  Parking our car in a nearby garage worked out well, and the location was walkable for all of the tourist areas of Bruges.  Breakfasts were beautifully displayed and we had a lot of carb options to pick from, as well as freshly prepared eggs.  Overall, it was a lovely choice for our two-day visit to Bruges.",positive
"Structure under construction. ordered lunch (Kroketen) that arrived frozen! They did offer a free beer as compensation. Okay. But what was the cook drinking?? Free parking but overloaded. Takes 20min to find a spot. Bad area, full of eurabians. Upside< Close to the highway.,

breakfast ok but not great and below vdf standards in holland",negative
"Smartflat has a bad customer service.
I booked online via booking.com and I paid for my staying. 
Then two day before my staying, they contacted me through WhatsApp asking me to pay an additional cost of € 150,00 as warranty (deposit money) 
So I had to fix that asap to confirm my staying cause if I didn’t my reservation would be cancelled and I would loose my money, I already paid.
So I did everything. Now 3 weeks later, I’m calling, texting their customer service to get my warrant (deposit money) back. They not answering or sometimeS when they answer, they say that already released my deposit but I haven’t got it till now. 3 weeks afters. ,

Everything! The location is fantastic - city centre, close to everything, but also quiet. The room is outstanding! The breakfast is very very good! The staff is friendly and very professional! Chester B&B clearly exceeded our expectations - is much better than you can imagine. For the price, you never will find better! Thank you for everything.",positive
"The location was ideal for the event we were attending. Although the hotel is a little out of town, the city centre is easily reached by public transport.  The reception staff were very friendly, helpful and especially understanding when we explained we had to check out earlier than planned due to an emergency. The new refurbished rooms are excellent. We had no problems with noise from the refurbishments, although we had an email advising us of the works before we arrived.We will be back next year!",positive

Staff very friendly and helpful,  breakfast a large choice.",positive
"I was slightly surprised that there were no free toiletries and no electric kettle (as promissed in the confirmation mail), and the room was probably smaller than the indicated 19 m2. Luckily I was the only guest in this double-bed room.,

The hotel is in a walking distance from the Brussel Noord railway station. My room had a bath tub which was great. I opted for no breakfast because I was limited in my budget (a business trip) so I cannot comment on this.",positive

"The room is not well isolated, it's like the walls are made out of carton! I could even hear my neighbour yawning in the morning! I had an early wake up call, good thing I had earplugs and noise reduction headset to fall asleep...,

The hotel met my expectations. The location is nothing particular, on a main road, with easy access by car. Friendly and helping staff. The room was great, comfortable bed and pillows, nice shower and bathroom, large desk, TV, chairs and plenty of light. The room temperature was easily adjustable, and the window opens.",positive
"Nothing!,

We adored this apartment, it's beautiful and we felt completely relaxed as soon as we arrived after work on a Friday, it really is zen. The hosts are so friendly and go to a lot of trouble to make sure their guests are happy.  The outdoor jacuzzi is a must, so relaxing.  We drove to the location but took our bikes with us as the area is beautiful for cycling and walking. You are minutes away from the forest. Tip: if you want to walk to the nearest town of Hotton, go via Ny as it is away from the main road. It takes longer (about 6km) but a lovely route.",positive
"There was no coffee making facilities in the room, only tea. Bathroom was cold in comparison to the bedroom,

Good breakfast with fruits, good room, free parking",positive
"- the house is a bit noisy due its wooden construction/ limited sound proofing,

We were very impressed by the cosy decoration and thoroughly enjoyed the evenings with all candles lit. The host offered suggestions for some very special restaurants nearby.

"neighbour kept complaining about us leaving our outdoor light on, would have enjoyed sitting outside on a evening but we left it on by accident and had a note written on the doors,i fully understand if someone was upset about noise etc but a small light ? abit OTT,

Location was amazing, really great place for couples or families, right by a lidl and Aldi and loads of places to eat, we don't drive but did not struggle to get around as the bus stopped right outside and we got the train to the city of Geel,we also rented some bikes from a bike shop up the road (10min walk) just above Aldi that cost us £10 a day to rent and the bikes where good quality.The communal showers where great,really clean,didnt see anyone else even using them, normally puts me off using communal ones but these where better than most hotel/air bnb private ones",positive
"Stayed here 5 years ago and it is lovely to see the owner has still got a real passion for making everything perfect, so many lovely touches from cake left in the room each day, sweets to help yourselves to, free coffee/tea, plenty of advice on places to visit or to eat and the breakfast always came with care and imagination :) On top of this beautifully decorated rooms, clean and very comfortable.Ypres is just a short drive away as are a lot of War cemeteries, we also found some lovely walks so made the most of the good weather for this time of year.",positive

Very comfortable bed, and lovely bathroom! Friendly and helpful owner and lovely charming period feature property in a central location, but still quiet.",positive
"There is no direct city transport to the hotel. The hotel is about 20 min away from the airport by car, if there is no traffic (typically for the time between 5pm till 8pm) otherwise it could take you more than 40 min.,

Breakfast was very good, eggs anyway you want them, cereal, meats, fruit, yoghurts croissants etc. More than enough, and all was fresh. We had 2 rooms on the top floor, 65 stairs, but we knew that, and was very good exercise as they do not have a lift, we knew that also. Great rooms and large bathrooms with all mod cons.

"close to heavy traffic road, pretty much nois with room at front side,No good chairs in lobby to drink a beer. Frniture old fashioned and not comfortable.,

clean room, airco",positive
"Fist impression was very bad and it was my trip to Brussels. When we arrived, there was no lobby, no reception, no concierge... only a counter with one person and not even with a hotel uniform. This was more like rent a room rather than a 3star hotel as it is advertised. The hotel’s webpage says nothing about the renovations and Booking.com  says that construction will end by Sept 10, which was not true, not even close. The room does NOT have air conditioner so if you want to rest during your vacations this is not the place. It has a fan (not a ceiling fan) not big enough to keep the room cool and if you leave the glass door open you will listen all the noise from the street and also all the light will come inside the room. I sweated all night. Bed and pillow are not confortable. There is no an ice machine. The day we left the only elevator thy have was not working to take the luggage down. For the approx. $125 per night that I paid, or maybe paying a little more, I would have find a much better place. I did not move to another place because of cancellation fees and looking for a hotel at last moment would cost much more. I definitely don’t recommend this place. The only good things it has is the location. ,

Location",negative
"The walls/door were rather thin, while floors/stairs were quite creaky. The place is also really close to a railway line, but this is obvious when you see the location. I suppose the owners are aware of the noise problem as they provide ear plugs. I overlooked the fact that the toilet is IN the room, separated from the rest of the room by a curtain. It was not a big problem for us, but I imagine it can bother some people.,

Nice breakfast, big room. Comfortable bed.",negative

"Spotless, comfortable, perfect location and very friendly hosts. I highly recommend this place.",positive
"When a guest arrive, the people at the reception should give proper instructions of where to go not just giving a key and tell someone the lifts are around the corner. At the bar those people working there should be somehow friendly to guests.,

The breakfast was good with the diversity of food that suits even people from foreign countries. The location is good where one can connect well with transportation (bus and train). It is also near a good restaurant where one can have descent dinner and also near the shopping Mall where one can buy gifts to take home.",positive

This hotel is great if you travel by car. On booking.com I searched for hotels near airport with shuttel bus.

I had not been notified before arrival that the hotel was being renovated the whole downstairs was a mess and I had originally booked to have breakfast included but was not told before hand that this would not be possible because there was no kitchen or dining room!,

"This time it was not as much live around the cocktail bar downstairs as it used to be before when I have been visiting (also of course meaning it was now very quiet for the night being beneficial for the guests sleeping over this time). The breakfast at the hotel is always very good while this time I was told it ended at 10 clock while homepage still says it should be 10.30.,

Have been many times at Hotel Professor as former student in Leuven 20 years ago visiting the city on a regular basis and its always nice especially when I get my favourite room at the hotel as happened this time. Besides this the hotel (I assume I am not offending anyone by saying it is more like a guesthouse, not being so fancy at all), is just perfectly located in town.",positive

"We arrived at a time when they were totally renovating the lobby. They were painting the walls and the floor was down to the cement. Would not have stayed here if I had known. Though the rooms were not effected it still felt uncomfortable with having no sitting area and feeling like you are in a middle of a construction site instead of a relaxing holiday. Would have appreciated knowing this.,

The location was close to most sites. Very close to McDonalds which was good for a quick breakfast.",negative

The room is cleam",negative

location is perfect, staff is friendly, good price/quality",positive
Mr. Scholtus is very kind and an excellent host! Thank you for your hospitality!,positive
"There was bad smell in room section. Staff do not know English. Also it is exactly located at the heart of a crowded truck parking so you should consider this too,

Staff are friendly. It is not like a regular hotel since it is in a truck parking and the costumers are almost truck drivers so it is different environment, but not everyone would like this",negative
"The room we stayed in was absurdly small for two adults and a young teenager. It would have been tolerable for a single individual, but certainly not for three people (of any size). In this regard I felt the images provided by (what I believed to be) the hotel itself were at best deceptive.,

The breakfast served was delicious and served in a spacious, lovely room with large windows opening out onto the property. The staff were very friendly and helped us find very economical transportation to Calais at stay's end. We were very grateful.",positive
fitness room equipment was not fully functional,positive

"There is no sign outside which says Hotel or Exit29. Staff unfriendly, receptionist refuses to understand any other language than french and gave me s filthy look, cause i tried to comunicate in english. Pillows are a horror, rooms cold and bare. Remote for TV didnt had batteries. Heating switches off at night, so rooms are icecold in the morning. Dont go there again.,

Convenient to park, next to highway.",negative
"Charging for parking.,

Nice big room and comfortable bed. Pleasant gardens and good breakfast.",positive

"Clean, cosy room and lobby. Hand sanitizers everywhere. Nice location that is just outside of the city center. It is about a 15 minute walk to the busy center",positive
"Whilst it didn’t worry us, aswe enjoyed the view, there is no lift, so those with younger children might want to check to see if there are rooms available on a lower floor.,

After arriving hours later than we had predicted, we were given a warm welcome in this stunning building, located so centrally! The breakfast was extensive, they collect the pastries from a local bakery at 7am each morning! Exceeded my expectations!",positive
"All was good ,

Very nice place",positive
"Good location, comfortable rooms, good breakfast,",positive
"It was pretty noisy at night since there are quite a few bars and clubs in the immediate vicinity and the room didn't have soundproof windows.,

"The owners were really nice, friendly and helpful.",positive
Just perfect,positive
"Top floor rooms recently refurbished and not quite top notch: no bedside cabinets, wet room design odd (toilet roll holder not accessible) and no hair drier or showel gel/shampoo. Parking limited. Restaurant closes at 9pm even on Saturday night.,

Breakfast good, staff pleasant, lift access excellent.",positive

the ease of access to the motorway",negative
"No privacy on windows unless I closed the curtains and then it was dark in the room light on no energy saving?,

Location,large room, near sea front parking.I cannot comment on breakfast as my leaving time was 8am and breakfast we were informed opened at 8am.This particular day it was snowing so important that I left on time to catch train.Overall value for money",positive
"Noisy rooms,

Brakfast",positive

The measures they undertook to protect their guests and employees. Breakfast great under this circumstances and also the rest of the accommodation. I would book again.",positive

very good location  to stop on the way to Germany or Italy",negative
Location is good,positive
"Sauna wasn't a steam sauna, just a really hot room.  Whilst the gym has a good variety of equipment there was only one running machine, cycle machine and ski-walker so I was unable to use them during my stay.,

Breakfast.  Interesting view (despite the nearby building site)",positive
"Great place, great location, exellent value for money.",positive
"Its rather loud because its surrounded by clubs and bars. Not the Hotels fault, but it was tough to get a full night of sleep.,

Very friendly people working there! The breakfast was very good and the Hotel literally is in the middle of the city - you couldn't be more central and you can reach everything by foot!",positive
"very nice small property, very close to the park and nice restaurants around. Very kind owner.",positive
"Basically everything. Not even the tv control was working, and for the price we paid we were expecting that as a very minimum,

Poor location, staff cooperation, value for money. Place is a cross road for truck traffic and the only shop closed at 6.30 pm (it should be opened 24h). Restaurant is very expensive for the quality it gives and the location it is at (middle of nowhere).",negative
"This family hotel has undergone extensive renovation over the years and is improving every time I go there. Located in the quiet old historic centre of De Panne, guests travel back in time. If you want a honest and friendly hotel and excellent price/value, this is the place to be. Congratulations to the owners for all the work that has been done over the years!",positive
"When used shower floor got soaked. Didn't get a good view. Carpet needed to be cleaned. ,

Good location, can walk to everything. I really liked that you could choose to donate to a charity if skipped having your room cleaned for a day.",positive
Should be 4 star hotel!,positive
"The room I was staying in has windows facing the street with several bars. So, it was extremely noisy till 3 am both nights I spent there. Of cause, it is a price one has to pay for a hotel in the center of lively student city:-) So, I advise to ask for a quite room specifically, if possible.The bigger problem is the state of the room, however. The carpit needs to be replaced, the shower is working only partly. Some furniture clearly needs repair as well.,

The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is convinient: it is in a very heart of the city, the central railway station can be reached by walking in 15 minutes. The is a bus lines stop nearby.",positive
"Nothing.,

Lovely place, comfortable and clean. Staff very welcoming.",positive
Very clean and good. Would surely to stay again,positive
Nice central location. Easy walk to the seaside and the centre of town. Was convenient that they had parking on site (at a cost) as the street parking was really full.,positive
"Very thin walls and door, noise from corridor. There were also construction work very close, but that was noisy only day time, so that was not an issue.,

Good breakfast, good bed, reasonable internet connection",positive

"It seemed like the AC wasn't working. ,

The rooms are cleaned comfortable enough for two. And soundproof!",positive
"Breakfast was mediocre. The room didn't have a bathtub whereas that was the main purpose for booking this hotel - as the ad suggested it would have one.,

Location is pretty good because it's central, but expect loud students in the night.",negative
very nice cosy apartment well organized. The host was very nice and carefull to guest needs.,positive
"Bathroom stank of stale cigarette smoke - had to sleep with the window open when it was snowing outside - unacceptable to a non-smoker that the 'hotel' has not rectified this. Rooms basic and small in the basement - bed is ok but not particularly comfortable. Looks superficially clean, but actually is not. Check in is at the cafeteria till - no staff present at this till on arrival. Stood around waiting - then told that I must book via the internet before I could check in, even though I had already booked via this website. This is a truck stop motel and not a hotel. Not recommended for anyone other than truckers.,

Conveniently located in a truck stop on a motorway junction. Clean bed linen. Breakfast just ok with good coffee.",negative
"Can´t think of anything to criticise, really. No breakfast was included in the room price, but you can´t have everything at this competitive price!,

Very quiet room towards garden, convenient on-street parking next to hotel entrance, comfortable and quite spacious room, helpful staff, Great location in pretty & quiet de Panne, and only a short distance from the E40 motorway.",positive
"The equipment is a hit and miss. I had a Nespresso coffee maker, which is OK, but it didn't work 100% well. There were no toiletries, just a basic squeeze thing for shower gel in the shower. There were no information sheets in the room (e.g., I wanted to know the gym opening times but there was no information around).And seriously, in the 21st century and at this price range you're supposed to have electrical sockets (if not USB plugs directly) near the bedroom. The socket situation wasn't good at all.,

The hotel is superbly situated and looks like it was recently renovated. The room was big and the bed was comfortable.The staff were helpful. There was a cool way of mirroring your telephone/tablet to the TV, which is handy. The wifi was excellent.",positive
"It was relatively hard to keep my room cool, which resulted in very warm nights.,

The staff was incredibly nice and wore their masks at all times, the room felt very high quality and the hotel offered enough hand sanitizer so that I never felt like my health was at risk.",positive
Noisy,negative
"the trucs engines on the parking always on all of the night,

The person at hotel",positive
"The shower nice and roomy,

Nice but look at the lift buttons where the rooms are located as our room 313 as you would gess is not on the 3rd floor it's on the 6th , the room was nice and bright with window blinds that you pull down via a sash cord located on the right which makes the room very cosy, showers are great, also if you have a small child with you beware the windows open fully , a good place to stay and a lovely atmosphere",positive
Bed comfortable,positive

The hosts were kind and amazingly helpful. Breakfast and dinner were incredible, extremely generous. The place in itself is cute and very well located. A hidden gem that we’ll visit again",positive
"Signage from the entrance to the room is poor and it’s easy to get lost in the many corridors.,

Room was comfortable and clean. Quiet at night.",negative
"The horribly twisty and extremely steep stairs to get up to our apartment located on the third floor. No light over the mirror in the bathroom and an extremely small garbage bin in the kitchen. Missing a folder/information in the room about tips of things to see, do and where to eat in Antwerp and the WiFi code.,

Top location and modern new apartment in the heart of Antwerp's historical district.",positive
"Not worth mentioning ,

The exceptional warm and hospitality of the host family, despite Covid-19 challenges, was a highlight. 
The breakfast first class.",positive
"Excellent breakfast, amazing restaurant.",negative
"NoThe heating on my second night was really high and I could not find a way to adjust it apart from opening the windows (but better like this than too cold!).COVID restrictions meant all restaurants and bars were closed... (but no problem with noise, when the windows were open...!).,

The bed was very comfortable indeed and the shower was excellent, too.Nice quality, basic selection of crockery available for the kitchenette and self-catering.Good location, close to the waterfront, river-buses,'The View' big wheel and some nice-looking shopping streets (although closed while I was there).",positive
Rustic style and breakfast.,positive
"The charging station for electric cars, specifically mentioned as a facility, wasn’t working. The hotel therefore waived my parking fee for Saturday. There is a public station around the corner (Hoogstraat), with free parking on Sunday. Also two stations in the St. Michiel’s parking garage (5min walk from the hotel), where you can park all Sunday for only 4 euros. These are both good options.,

The building is beautiful, also our room, spacious and with historic details. Very quiet overall. The bed was very comfortable. Excellent location, you walk straight into the center. Friendly staff, nice local atmosphere. We loved it.",positive

The location and facilities were amazing, we loved the room.",negative
Top appartement in the centre of the city. Would recommend.,positive
Very welcoming B&B. Great breakfast.,positive
"Room wasn't too clean. 5 beds in one room is not really cosy. It felt more that we stayed in an overpriced hostel than  a hotel room. There are no healthy breakfast options at all. Very old school way of serving breakfast. We were unhappily surprised about the way breakfast was served. According to us there are barely any measures taken against Corona. Too many people put into a small room with no ventilation.,

It has a nice atmosphere.",negative
"This is my 2nd visit to Same hotel. Previous stay was great and it was value for money. This time the cost was double and the hotel was not able to accommodate change in dates of stay. Too much noise in the room. At the same time even speaking inside the room disturbs the next door,

Staff are cordial.",positive

"Noise of construction ,

Location
And cleaniness",positive
"The property is well situated in the square very close to everything you need. I had the feeling not many people were around probably because of the date being mid December, I was greeted on Saturday by a lovely receptionist who explained everything to me and gave me a book of vouchers for various things around Ypres, I stayed for four nights bed and breakfast, the breakfast was the normal continental buffet with a good supply of every thing Paul who i think was the manager is very welcoming and attentive makes sure everything is ok overall I had a nice stay at this hotel and I would use it again thank you to Paul who was always there for any questions 👍",positive

"N/A,

We visited for a night to go to a gig nearby but would happily have stayed longer. Our room was warm and cosy with lots of lovely touches and plenty of tea/coffee and treats in the room. The couple that run the B&B are really friendly and nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. The house and garden were beautiful and breakfast was fabulous, complete with delicious homemade jams.",positive
"The quality of the bed could have been better and although sufficient the bathroom facilities need some help too.,

Breakfast is spectacular.  The owners are friendly and very helpful. The surroundings are perfect: the canal is beautiful and the fields are such a restful environment.",positive
"Not the property so much but the Coronavirus meant that the city was in lock down and food not available anywhere 
We had breakfast one day which was limited ( understandably given restrictions) and expensive for the reduced offer
Also given the lock down in the city the hotel could have more proactively helped with food ,

Full of character",positive

"I booked a 3 bedroom chalet/caravan with private toilet and shower. The shower had only hot water and I had wash myself and my children with a bucket and I got no compensation for that. Tough luck for me.After checkout, I had to beg for 2 weeks to get my 200 euro deposit back. That was also awkward, the problem was not really the time it took, but the lack of accurate feedback/communication about it.",negative

"Poor pressure from shower, bed was really hard and pillows where very lumpy. Room wasn't like the photo.,

Location was excellent, breakfast was nice.",positive
"The hotel is sprawling so it may take a while to find the room. Guess some rooms towards the main road may be noisy so it is better to ask for a quiet room.,

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the location is great (next to the centre of Brussels). Guess the breakfast and restaurant area of the hotel is also good but cannot comment on that since not used.",positive

"Can't think of anything negative.,

I stayed for 3 nights with my partner, and we had a twin room. Everything in the room looked brand new, and was very clean. Plenty of space, lovely bathroom, and very comfortable bed - room 211. Typical continental breakfast, with cooked items also available, nice coffee and orange juice. The staff were pleasant and helpful. Good wifi, and news coverage in English available. The hotel is very close to lots of restaurants, cafes, bars, shops etc. Even though it was close to everything, it was quiet at night. There is some renovation work being carried out on the rooms, but we weren't disturbed at all - no noise etc. We are planning to return to Brugge again, at some stage this year, as we didn't have time to see everything during our short trip. Will we be staying at this hotel again? Yes!",positive
"The room smelt of smoke,

The breakfast was good",positive
"A short uphill walk from the Brussels station, this was a great hotel. With 24/7 service, it has attracted a lot of business travelers, creating for a vibrant environment at its bar when the rest of the city seemed to be asleep.

Amazing place!!!! Best B&B ever stayed. Were sad that stayed only 1 night. Super clean and authentic. Owners opened the house up for us in the middle of the night and prepared breakfast. Probably the best value for money. Definitely will return!",positive

This was like going to your grandparents': the hosts did their utmost to make you feel welcome & comfortable. Breakfast was tailor-made. Big rooms with plenty of extras: tea & coffee makers - incredible choice of tea - loads of goodies in the bathroom. Beautiful garden.",positive
"Nothing really!,

Simple but elegant with nearly all the facilities in the room that you would expect in a much more expensive hotel. Friendly and helpful staff and an excellent breakfast.",positive
"Everything OK, but I let my car outside the parking: 10€ for 83€ (price of the room) is too much for me!,

Already the 3rd time I stay at this hotel….",positive
It was very cold in the room,negative
Car park so far away when we had to carry big bags every day to car,negative
There was no breakfast buffet because of corona.,positive
We stayed for two nights and it was very lovely stay. Hosts were excelent and very friendly. Accomodation pretty cosy and well equiped. And we even found a time to play ping pong on garden which is huge and you can also park there. It was overall pleasent stay and we recommend it.,positive
"Wifi didn't work (at least where our chalet was, maybe better in other parts of the area).,

Very nice and practical chalet/mobile house, equipped with everything we needed, perfectly clean, in a quiet environment. Fantastic location. It is a perfect place also for a longer holiday. Unfortunately we couldn't try the pool, because we had cold and rainy days at the end of september. So we plan to go back next summer :-)",positive
"You have to book it during weekend because otherwise, there would be construction working in front of it",positive
"As with most hotels in the old quarter of Bruges, there's no parking, so you have to take pot luck on the street. It also has an after-hours keypad / deposit box key retrieval system which I personally don't like as I've had problems with them in the past, but to be fair this one works perfectly well.,

Many of the hotel's rooms and some of the interior decor have been upgraded, and the difference it's made is amazing ( I've stayed here several times before ) We stay here to work in the Stadsschouwburg, which is literally across the road, so the location is excellent, and the hotel has gone from being a convenient and functional place to stay to a genuinely nice destination hotel.",positive
"Welcoming, friendly staff, ideally situated",positive

Very nice, clean, comfortable room. Everything was as it should be.",positive

Great location and good value for money. Hotel is located very close to the center. Perfect stay if you are doing a lot of sight seeing and need a place to stay that is close by and not that expensive. I can recommend this property and will definitely stay there again. Staff were also very friendly in helping us to leave our bags and change before we could check-in.",positive

"Sauna was a bit smelly and we did not use. ,

Close to the amenities",positive
"Poor breakfast. We received a paper bag with our breakfast the night we arrived. I suppose it’s because we are going through a difficult times  with the pandemic situation and there were almost no customers,

Beautiful hotel. Beautiful decor. Great host! Friendly staff. Comfortable room with nice view",positive
"There are huge works going on next door, the noise started at 7:15 AM. They provide earplugs for one person, which is a nice gesture, but if you book a twin room, they should provide two sets of earplugs.,

The staff lounge and bar area is comfortable and inviting. Room is decent, comfortable bed and pillows, adequate bathroom.",positive
"Unfortunately hotel was undergoing renovations - extra dust in corridors, a bit of a maze getting around the works. We were made aware of this beforehand though, so knew to expect this.,

Beautiful rooms. Very comfortable. Kind, attentive staff. The location is ideal, close to city centre and main attractions, surrounded by cafes, restaurants and bars.",positive
"Reception a bit haphazard.  I had to leave my key on the desk when I left as there was nobody there to give me a receipt.  But maybe that was unusual.,

"There is no kettle in the room, you pay an additional deposit when you arrive even if you don’t have breakfast/need to park. Parking is an extra cost despite being a customer of ibis, the breakfast selection was very limited and overall didn’t think the hotel was good value for money at all.",negative
"wifi is not workingbreakfast poor",positive
"I booked via booking.com because the centerparcs website always showed an error when I wanted to proceed to paying.  With my booking.com reservation number I wasn't able to use the center parcs app to make reservations for activities, I always had to book at reception. No big deal, but probable easy for the IT guys to fix.,

Very friendly and helpful stuff. Great holidays for parents and children.Aquadrom make you fell like a child again on all the slides. The house has all the equipments needed, next time we will bring more towels on our own.",positive

"The property was dirty and hadn’t been cleaned properly. It was also situated near ponds which attracted mosquitoes and other nasties which made our week a living hell. It also took 15 minutes to walk to the facilities on the park and 20 minutes to the car park. A 30 minute round trip to buy or use anything is not fun. The lodge area is also very poorly sign posted, very easy to get lost and also hard to find your lodge, again adding time to any journey. ,

Quiet",negative
"On a hot summer  night, the place gets warm and opening the windows exposes the noise of the main road. Maybe AC would be a good idea. But this place perfectly met my needs, as I was having a get-together with friends in the neighborhood and did not want to drive back in the evening.,

Nice place, perfectly fine.",negative

Location was excellent for Menin Gate and the centre of Ypres. 
Restaurant and breakfast were very good",positive
"Bed linen was a joke, 2 individual blankets for a couples bed...
Our room was facing the street and we could hear the metro passing (it was okay for us anyway).
Staff on the check out were terrible. Not a smile or a “did you enjoy your stay?”. We asked if it was possible to leave our luggage and we got a “I’ll check if we can accommodate, but you also have lockers at the central station”, waited 5 min, never hear back from the lady. ,

Location is perfect, clean and nice to be around. Staff at the check in were amazing.",positive
"Nothing, just a little advice: use another cleaner facility for the towels.,

Excellent location and accommodation. Exceptionally clean.
Very nice and helpful staff.
Very well organised the room, despite the small space.
Good quality coffee maker and kettle.
A place which is in my opinion highly recommended for travellers.
We were very sad because of our short stay.",positive
"There was nothing we didn't like although a word of warning, the walls if the bathroom are made of glass with an opaque curtain separating the bed and bathroom. This wasn't an issue for my partner and I but may be an issue for some.,

Hotel was beautiful, modern with minimalist styling. Very friendly and helpful staff. WiFi was fast with no issues anywhere in the hotel. Location was great, 2 min walk from the nearest tram and metro stop and 5 min walk to the cathedral. The hotel was quiet i.e it's not a party hotel.",positive
"The bedroom was big and comfortable, however the layout of the bathroom is very uncomfortable.,

The location is excellent, very central and next to the main attractions, restaurants and shops in the historical center. Saint Bavo's Cathedral is right at the corner. However, one of the best things about the hotel is the reception staff. All of them are extremely friendly and thoughtful. They were always willing to help and to offer recommendations and suggestions to make our stay even more pleasant.",positive

Staff,positive
"blonde at the reception, very unkind and not helpful at all. At the reception you can buy fire starters made with petroleum (for barbecue use) which causes an awful smell in the air everywhere.

Parking on site €15/night, not cheap but maybe cheaper than 'normal' car parks. VERY convenient to walk to Gent City Centre & to catch Tram to St Pieters Station.

We could have done with some basics for a quick meal - bread, milk, butter, ham/cheese or eggs.Staff were rudeVilla didn't have half the beds made and only supplied 2 towels for our family of 4The Evergreens restaurant all you can eat is way too expensive not to include drinks in the price.,

Swimming pool was goodChildren's play area was good. Distance from the villa to the centre was great",negative
"As improvement I recommend more easy accessible  plugs to charge your devices in the room !!,

Very nice staff :),positive
"I think they should have warned us that is was in the middle of being refurbished. There was a lot of dust everywhere. While they advertise having a bar they failed to inform us that it closed at 9 0'clock. Our families where celebrating birthdays and all are over 60 so didn't want to go out at that time of night.,

The rooms are fantastic and the staff are very helpful. The location was also good.",negative

Breakfast was OK; location convenient a few minutes walk from a metro station.",positive
"There was no heat in the room. This was not disclosed at check in. We ended up not staying at the property. Staff didn’t do anything to accommodate us. We were smart not to prepay for the room. Otherwise it would be impossible to get the money back.,

Swimming pool is amazing. Better at night as pools are outside in some cases. Open til 9pm so that was good to fill up the evening. Rooms are adequate for what we need. Cycle routes outside the camp are fantastic.,positive

"The beds were irritating. We had requested one double bed but the mattresses were in such a way that there was a huge gap between us. we had to keep pushing the mattresses all the time inside the bed frame which was a real bother in the nights.,

The location is a bit far from the city, but well connected with metro line. Nearby eateries are less during the night which might be a hassle. But the hotel provides pizza with toppings of our choice for Euro 12.50 even during midnights. The area is calm and quiet. For people with private vehicle can visit Hallerbos during spring season which is just 20 - 25 mins away by drive. The area is very near the highway sections.",positive

It was okay - but for that amount of money - we can get alsewhere a bigger room. The breakfast was oke - but a little bit sober: no cappuccino for example.,

The atmosphere was cozy and the staff were very kind. We would like to work and the find a good place for as to work. They leave the key somewhere - so we can arrive after 00:00. That was really nice.",positive

"Breakfast- restricted due to Corona virus but thats not the hotel fault. No tea/coffee facility in room. ,

Less than a minute walk to Cathedral and Belfort. Lots of places to eat and drink within minutes of the hotel.",positive

Design",positive
"Firmer mattress,

Everyone was so friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble Great breakfast and would go back again",positive
"The rooms were very small specially the shower, my partner is 2m and had a difficult time getting around or showering,

we liked the Location, very close to restaurants and businesses.",positive

Good location",positive
"great breakfast served at your table, drinks and bites at arrival. Was a nice welcome! Very friendly staff.",positive
"The rooms were very basic but this was reflected in what you paid for.  Didn't spend much time in the rooms, so in that sense it was perfect.,

Really central to the main centre of Ghent, this was a really important factor as we walked everywhere.  The level of sanitation during COVID-19 was great and we felt very safe during our stay.",negative
"No water &  kettle provided ,

Simple and clean",positive
"Locations is great, cleanliness",positive
Excellent location,positive
"Neighbours (or guests) sometimes a little bit loud.Also, since it is in a relatively old tenement house, there is a classic issue with flushing toilet paper - might be a problem if there are many guests and staying for longer...,

Classic standard place in Antwerp in a quiet (in Winter time at least) but a little bit peripheral quarter (20-30 min walk from Central Station). Still - easy to get to, and bus stops going to Central Station or Berchem 5 minutes away from the place.The quarter itself is very interesting, since it's a cultural mix with people from all over the world, very nice. And a park and spacious squares in the vicinity - good for jogging. Supermarkets close by.Shared bathrooms per floor, and a big nice shared kitchen (with all utensils) on the ground floor.I stayed in a small single room - pretty basic, but not different than any other I stayed in Antwerp throughout the years.Definitely not for staying in for hours, but that's not why you visit Antwerp;)Room, bathroom and the kitchen clean, no issues with that.Host very helpful and quickly responding.",positive
"We have nothing that we didn't like - everything were absolutely perfect.,

Everything was perfect, the service, the room, the surroundings, the food, the bed - we were more than pleased with all of it.We will absolutely recommend this hotel and verything about it.",positive
"too warm at night in the room.,

It is great value for money, including the breakfast is high quality. It has a super central & at the same time quiet location with many small restaurants closeby. The hotel is very modern and size of the room is more than correct. certainly come back to this hotel.",positive
"Some outside noise as on the front of the hotel on the market place,

Good breakfast & excellent location",positive
center is far from the property.,positive
"The room was what you would expect in this price range, with a really nice and spacious bath. The hotel has a lovely garden with tennis court. But the best part is the food, really enjoyed both breakfast and dinner, and the staff made an exceptional effort of having us enjoy the evening even if we had to have dinner in our room because of COVID-19.",positive
"First of all we loved the hosts. The warm welcome, care, openness and sense of freedom. The love for heritage and books. 
Second, we loved all about our stay, starting from a superb breakfast, exploring the surroundings and resting in the house. The old is mixed with new and there is a scent of an old welcoming house. A house with a character.
Third, we love the aftertaste of our stay. We keep smiling and we will return. Actually it is weird to write so much good and then hope that we will be able to find a slot to book again and bring our friends. But we need Katleen to keep spreading this happiness because she makes this world a better place. With love Maija & Jan",positive
"No tea/coffee in room which was disappointing otherwise difficult fault. ,

Modern, clean, location",positive
"Wifi seemed to provide zero internet connection. Luckily Spring partners with Proximus and the service throughout belgium has been incredible,

Excellent bed, great room, incredible location",positive
"The walls are very thin. You can hear everyone talking, even moving through the walls.,

It was very cozy, beautiful and perfect for what I needed.",positive
"That the entire building and its surroundings weren't finished and the building work started at 7am (if not earlier). The ice machine didn't work. Two of the four lifts didn't work. The 'fitness' floor was dire and the 'spa' was much to be desired. The front of the hotel is covered in scaffolding so you can't see the building making it easy to walk by. ,

The proximity to the city centre, the public transport and the gard du midi. It's ease to check in and out. The view from the sauna (apart from the huge cranes). The Nespresso machine, free water and the cleanliness of the room. Plus, the TV had a few English channels which passed the evening away before bed.",negative
"All good,

Excellent staff, Covid safe and a really nice dinner. 
Would stay again and highly recommend",positive
"Wonderful place. Waking up with the sound of the birds. Best homemade breakfast ever. Friendly welcome.",positive
"No free coffee or water.  Very hot in rooms during our stay in the winter.  No way to control the temperature other than opening a window.  Then you got street noise.  
Almost didn’t book the hotel because of the name.  A Motel in the USA means that it is a place to stay with doors that open to an outside corridor.   Not the case here.  The name of this place should have been Hotel Hot One with no Coffee or Water.  ,

Close to grand palace   It was clean.",positive
"Nothing,

Friendly reception.No hassle",positive
"The tourist attractions aren't really within walking distance of the property.  There is a shared bathroom but there is one on each floor.,

The property is a large, clean modern townhouse with good amenities and within walking distance of the train station and the zoo.  After my first night (of the 2) I was moved to a lighter upstairs room with a window.  Great value for money with free coffee and wi-fi.On an additional note the owner's are absolutely amazing, a friend sent me mail which arrived after I had checked out of D.Cristina.  The owner's very kindly took the mail to the post office and arranged for it to be sent onto me in England (lifesavers).  A1.",positive

"Food, and in room service, was excellent.",positive
"Everything was perfect. ,

Beautifully refurbished old house, without disturbing too much the original, the host was just delightful, gave me a tour of the house (they also have a beautiful library), the breakfast was just amazing, with delicious home made jam, bread, waffles and locally sourced cheese and ham. Since I traveled in the middle of the pandemic, Kat adviced me that all restaurants were closed, but still offered me a delicious vegetarian lasagna and a desert. I can’t praise this place enough. Hopefully I’ll be back in better times. 5*!
P.S. I traveled with my dog, and there was no problem to accommodate her. 
They also have a beautiful very large garden.",positive
"The staff seemed to be a little bit worn out. The girl who checked us in sounded like a tape recorder. But then again it was right after x-mas and New Year, so perhaps they were actually really worn out and tired of tourists and customers. The lady in the breakfast room (the one who was pregnant) was the only one who I felt was really genuine in her customer service, honest smile and giving us a nice warm welcome both mornings. There was no coffee machine or kettle in the room, but that’s probably one way to keep the prices down.,

Clean, modern, spacious hotel  (spacious being the bar area and breakfast room). 10 min walk to city center. Simple but delicious breakfast (simple as in no warm eating). Nice bar with large drink and snack menus with lots of seating places. Easy access parking garage in same building, we booked a spot in advance. Great value for money. We would book in us here again.",positive
"Pillow was a bit dead.,

Friendly staff, neat clean and tidy room. Excellent breakfast, beer and food.",positive
"nothing to really cook;  there are a microwave, a fridge and something to boil water but that s allif you have a room near the street, could be a bit noisy the evening,

free coffee, good average between price and ""what you've got"",  I made a check-in earlier than  they normally do and it wasn't a problem, clean, wifi worked",positive

Very rich breakfast, quiet historic site and very near the town centre (5-10 minutes by foot), easily reachable by car.",positive

Perfect location. Great rooms. Nice staff. Thanks for everything,positive

"Anyone not liking this place prefers chain hotels and all-inclusive travel solutions probably.
,

It’s personal, it’s cosy and in a large country house among sloping hills.
Lovely place with welcoming hosts that make connections to all guests.
The real grandeur has gone,  but loads of charm and character have remained.
If you like a snoring fireplace and an homemade breakfast among a dozen of other benefits, this is the place to be.
Large rooms, comfy beds, good WiFi and local produce sum it up.
Dogs more welcome than young children is also worth something nowadays...
More books in the house than anyone can read in entire winter, so bad weather will make you read from paper again...",positive
"Clean comfortable rooms. Bright, airy and buzzing lounge area ideal to chill out after exploring and lovely coffee from the bar",positive
"Creaky floor in Room 304 and three great wooden beams caused access problems.,

Croissants were extra nice and the breakfast was great. Location brilliant and staff helpful and friendly.",positive
"The staff who registered me only spoke Portugese, no English. At first, I had a room without a window, which was totally unexpected and hard to deal with. Fortunately, I was able to move to a different room for my second night. The neighborhood seems to be up and coming, but still a little rough around the edges.,

Newly renovated, clean place, right next to a new park and in walking distance to the city center (about 20+ min.). Free coffee and tea.",positive
"My only complaint is no kettle in the room, very unusual.,

Really excellent location right in the centre of Ghent. Clean rooms, very comfy bed & nice bar area.",positive
"Small rooms with minimal closet space,

Room 511 is the smallest on that floor nice view, breakfast was nice but not included extra fee, neighborhood is great in the middle of everything, the room was tiny even for a new hotel that is trying to be ultra hip, the welcome glass of cava is a nice touch. Contemporary art in public spaces",positive

Comfortable beds, good size rooms and reat showers.",positive

Excellent choice. Beautiful and charming place. Awesome hotel.",positive

Huge hotel, with tons of amenities: bar, snacks, games, sauna, fitness center ...  really great.Staff really nice.Room very comfortable, a bit less spacious than other hotels of the same stars.Great view if your room is high enough",positive

The food served at breakfast and dinner. It was excellent. The choice of wines is very diverse and there is ample choice of 37.5 cl bottles.",positive

excellent host; great breakfast; the building has character",positive
The receptionists were really nice and friendly. I love the way they welcome me,positive

Room was basic but clean.",positive
"A little far from the center for walking,

Very clean, neat and comfortable",positive
"The room could get a bit suffocating during the night.,

The location is fantastic!",negative
"The industrial-chic decor works really well in the communal areas, but a bit less so in the rooms. My room had one, not particularly large, window, and the bare concrete ceiling made the room a bit gloomy. The opening hours of the reception are rather limited, especially on Sundays.,

The location of the hotel is perfect, very close to the Groenplaats and in a very pleasant area full of nice cafés and restaurants. The breakfast area is very comfortable and I enjoyed the diversity of the (plated) breakfast. The staff was welcoming and friendly throughout my 5-day stay.",positive
In één woord : Perfect!,positive
"There was a fire alarm beeping continuously, making sleeping very difficult (I expect the batteries to be close to out of power). ,

Great view and easy location/access to the beach.",positive
"Restaurant Fuego and Evergreen were seriously overpriced for what you received ,

Staff were friendly and helpful",positive
We loved the decor and the very friendly and hospitable host who was very communicative and helpful. The breakfast was scrumptious and plentiful. off street parking was great and we had access to bikes.,positive
"In fact, this was my second time I went there and I couldn't find anything which was not at the level of my expectations.Nothing I dislike of the Monasterium.,

The location is absolutely perfect for sightseeing. The flavor and atmosphere of the hotel is fantastic. It is as if you were in an ancient building.",positive

the hotel owners Peter and Elizibeth and staff are very freindly also helpful.  Peter and Elizibeth are very welcoming nothing is too much trouble",positive

"Horrid synthetic duvets - you can do better than thar Motel one,

You could open the windows",positive
"The signage outside the hotel could be clearer just to make it easier to locate when driving by. But that's a very minor point in a very good stay.,

Breakfast was good. Staff friendly. Location was excellent. Good free wifi.",positive
"Location is not optimal, but if you take care to take the shortest route to the exact! address then it is quite okay.  You share the bathroom facilities with at most two other people.,

Everything inside is new and clean. You have a room with a single bed, which is very good.Even with windows open, no noise from outside.Good Wifi.",positive
"There wasn't much to dislike.  ,

The view from the terraces are worth the money.   Location is excellent.   All the comforts.   I would recommend.",positive
"Friendly staff, very clean and the location is excellent.",positive
"Noise from the room upstairs but not the hotels fault - just inconsiderate guests!,

The room was just right - clean and comfortable.  The complimentary drinks and snacks in the evening were an unexpected bonus",positive
Marc & Mireille are very friendly hosts and provide great clean quiet rooms in an amazing country setting with all the comfort one could wish for! And they provide the most amazing breakfast you could wish for. This is a must go accomadation! If we will revisit the area we will return here again!,positive

The location of this studio is FANTASTIC! You are steps from the beach!",positive
"The staff seems tired and fed up...,

Very nice vip room with sauna, amazing range of activities indoor and outdoor",positive
"I would like to have some more sockets/plugs. Most of them are used for lighting.,

Superb location, great breakfast and worderfull owner who is very kind and helps you where needed. Parking is possible in private parking. You can also get a bike for free to travel to the center wich is great, because traffic in the city is very busy. The furnishing of the rooms is excellent and I will definitely come back when I visit Ghent again.",positive
"Very little to dislike! Our one observation is that the bedside reading lights are very, very bright, and not dimmable! A small thing really,

The location is superb - central so we could walk to the old city in 5 minutes. There is on-site car parking. The building is superb, a 13th Century monastery adapted to a modern hotel. The original church is still used for weddings, and is worth a visit in its own right. The breakfast is very good, offering a range of continental options, plus fruit, cereals, and scambled eggs, beans etc breakfast too, all self service.",positive
"Everything was great,

Very clean. Nice staff. Helpful Managers, thank you Peter and Liesbeth",positive

Location primarily, didn’t have dinner but breakfast was good",positive
"Everything!! The grounds, room, breakfast but most of all Katleen! The best night sleep in 2 weeks in Europe! It was a fantastic find!!! The pictures are after our stay but so wonderful!! I would absolutely stay here again.",positive
"I’ve stayed with this chain in 4 other cities (Manchester, Vienna and dusseldorf) and the augury I’d the Brussels one is less than the others. No USBs near tables, no kettle and make sure you don’t stay on level 0 as we did (twice this year). We had the room closest to breakfast area and I could hear the commotion in the morning, not to mention the faint metro rumblings,

Clear. Central. As good as I can expect from Motel One. If you can ignore the points below (in the what I didn’t like section), then you’re all set. Would I stay again? Yes but I’d request anything other than level 0",positive
"the rooms are a bit simple and small (typical of a lot of European hotels), not a lot of room to move around.  The shower, was a tiny square with 2 intersecting doors that opened enough to get out, but on the plus side it had really good water pressure.  The bed was low to the ground, but wasn't particularly uncomfortable.,

The location is right by the market square in the town center, close to most of the sites and near plenty of restaurants.  The public parking is across the street and is very reasonably priced.  The value was great, considering it was in the city center, and included breakfast.  Also, this was the easiest check-in ever.",negative
"There was no one at the property when I arrived. I wasn't told that I needed to phone the owner to be let in.,

Very clean",positive
"Only minor things: parking in front of the house is partly payable, though there is free parking 5-10 mins by foot away; there's no dishwasher; the hairdryer is too weak for some.,

Tasteful, clean and comfortable interior and spacious, sunny terrace; proximity to supermarkets, stores and main square around the corner; plenty of parking space in front; super-friendly host ensuring smooth key handover and providing some treats and useful material & information on the region.",positive
"Breakfast seems to be rather expensive,

It was conveniently situated.",positive
"It says breakfast included but this was a fixed breakfast with no allowance for dietary requirements or likes and dislikes.,

Right in the heart of the city with plenty of restaurants to hand. Staff very friendly and rooms clean and modern.",positive
Very warm atmosphere and fantastic hospitality.,positive
"Washer and dryer would have come handy. No hairdryer.,

Spacious studio with spectacular view. Quiet and peaceful, with central location, everything within walking distance, beach, stores, etc... Kitchen well equipped, efficient bathroom.",positive
"There was no air-conditioning, and it was very warm when we visited. Could have been cleaner overall in the cottage. Perhaps nets on the windows would be beneficial to keep insects away.,

The location is wonderful, and the whole park is very pleasant. Overall, it was good value for money.",positive
"Maison Mielou was a lovely place to stay. The room was beautiful and spacious and the host very nice. Please check in advance if they have availability should you need parking as they only have one spot for guests. However there was free street parking about 700m away. The bed was comfortable and the room lovely but it is an old house and there are creaky floor boards and quite thin walls. You definitely heard it when your partner used the bathroom at night! The interior is very lush and a bit eccentric. They even provided candles for a romantic ambiance. :-) Also note that the breakfast is not included in room price and it is served in the room. We found it relaxing to enjoy our breakfast in our pyjamas in the comfort of our room but the choice is limited to what's on the tray. It was a good quality continental breakfast (croissant, bread rolls, cheese, jam, brioche, boiled egg, yoghurt, fresh fruit), the first morning more generous than on our second day. There was also coffee and tea making possibility in the room. The house itself is gorgeous but the neighborhood is not the best. But it was an easy 20min walk to the city center. Maison Mielou also has bicycles to use. We did that and thought it was a great way of getting around and exploring also the outskirts of town. There are bicycle lanes everywhere and cars are used to bikes so it was very easy and enjoyable. Overall a good experience and I would stay Maison Mielou again.",positive
"Old-fashioned bathrooms (albeit partly renovated), lack of working wi-fi in the room.,

Central location, very close to the Coupure so easy access to university sites and public transport. Lots of active pubs in the area so highly recommended for those who want to combine activity with quiet and rest at the Monasterium.",positive
De douchestang was defect.,negative
"No option to adjust aircon in the room ,

Great location very comfortable",positive
"No air conditioning.,

Gardens immaculate for afternoon drinks. Evening meal was Michelin star standard absolutely superb. Rooms although compact have everything you need, bathroom modern and spacious with walk in shower.",positive
"The atmosphere, the location, the authenticity, the quietness and the kindness of the hosts! That's not counting the amazing breakfast prepared with love and care, with everything either home-made/homegrown or locally sourced!
An amazing getaway to relax and breathe in peace!",positive
"Great service, location was excellent. Clean rooms.",positive
"Lights did not work in the bathroom, but one was changed for us while we had breakfast, so I guess I cannot complain.,

Great location!  Nice room, but it was a little maze like in the corridors of the hotel.  Folks were friendly.Hotel is right on the square of the Grote Markt.",positive
Nice location.,positive
"The two terraces overcooking the city were special, we had breakfast on one terrace and some evening drinks on the other! Martine was so welcoming and we were touched by all of the extra little thoughtful things she includes. A great apartment to come back to after long days of cycling!",positive
"There is a constant humming sound when you open the window, but it's rather inevitable because it is in the center. Also easy to get used to it.,

Typical european meal, everything for everyone. The hotel is in the center of the old town, close to everything for sight seeing, also the tramway station is close but cannot hear it.",positive
Completely free bar from 5.30pm to 8.30pm - great touch,positive
"Warm, welcoming hosts. Excellent modern room and fabulous breakfast. Best we've ever had! Booked the suite for 3 persons for our sons as attending wedding nearby.",positive
"It would have been nice to be notified that there would be renovations taking place in the room nest to us. ,

The view and the location was excellent 
We loved the sea side view. My girlfriend enjoyed her birthday",negative

There were so many activities to choose from and the pool was fantastic - the children were in every day.",positive
"not really a lot of options to eat outside,

beautifull decoration, nice details. incredible good darkness, perfect to sleep",positive
"Shower too small.,

Room was very spacious and surprisingly had a sitting/dressing room. Huge bathroom.Bed was reasonable. Good variety of food for breakfast. Easy walking distance to city centte and tram",positive
"We stayed for 7 nights room was not cleaned and bathroom floor was disgusting, obviously not cleaned for a very long time. No security, no one in reception so keys for rooms and bike shed were easily available to anyone. Needs tlc and someone in charge who cares enough to oversee the cleaning and general organisation.,

Food was good but expensive . Room decor was very tasteful",negative
"The bed was so uncomfortable I bearly slept! The noise from the construction work started early in the morning, 6.45am.  We were not made aware of the major construction work at booking or on arrival. The man on the reception was not welcoming and didn't offer us any further assistance after giving the room key, I had to ask where the lift was and if it was okay for us to have a map so we could walk into Brussels city centre.Although the bathroom had a bath it had a crack by the plug which had some kind of putty in it, and the bath panel was broken along with the door frame. Strangely the sink came over your legs when sitting on the toilet so you had to sit at an angle. Shame as the bathroom was a good size.,

The breakfast had a wide choice and was tasty. The sauna was nice, clean and comfortable.",negative
Wonderful room.  Excellent service.  Superb food,positive
"Nothing, the only slight improvement might have been a kettle in the room,

Amazing house and rooms, lovely breakfast. Kathleen is a great host.",positive
"Excellent hotel located near the center a few minutes walk from the Grand Place, very convenient for public transport and for visiting the most important monuments. Nothing is left to chance. The bathroom, although blind, was spacious and functional, the sink a little small, but the shower is large and very bright. Do not expect large spaces, but it is fine for a 4-day stay as we did with a room that although small and without particular support is well organized, the furniture is essential but functionality and rationality are the masters. The staff is always present at the reception and is prepared and very kind. Excellent experience.",positive
"The last night we were there a water line broke above the door to our room and began to flood the room. I went down to the front desk to tell someone and I could not find anyone for over an hour and after I did find someone they didn't seem to worried about it. I just hope they got it stopped before it ruined to much. ,

The location could not have been better. Right in the main square of the city.",positive
"Nice and cost, good park out the front",positive
"Nothing that would come it me. They take every step to make your stay comfortable,

I stayed with my wife for a period of 12 nights due to work in Ieper  and I am quite happy with the stay. The reason is this place is get high rating is that, it has every stuff you need for a long stay (Kitchen, utensils , toaster, oven , coffee machine, etc.. ) but also that your Host really helps you during your stay. I mean to say they are genuinely in the business of service with assist you to things and information you need. It is this attitude that makes everyone welcome and happy to say.The location is equally good, with options for car/bicycle parking in the street. Overall we had a  very good stay .",positive
"Staff at check-in were very short with us, and unfriendly.,

Incredible location, reasonable price, small but very clean and comfortable room and bathroom.",positive

Amazing facilities and caters for all ages as we had a 7 year old and a 70 year old in our party! The activities were easy to book on the day and the aquamundo and discovery bay were fantastic.",positive
"Everything was great!,

Lovely room. Great shower. Good value for money.",positive
"Maintainince at a low standard.,

The hotel is build around a old church/monastery. In the hotel information it said that the remodel was done in 1998, well there are some maintenance chalances in the current time (sep-2018) that should be addressed. We enjoyed our stay, and that’s what counts!",positive
"Nothing appeared to dislike.,

Just everything. Is a lovely hotel with Charme as the name of the hotel. Great location, Free parking, Free Internet and playground if traveling with children. Breakfast was excellent served by 2 hard working women (Nadine & one more) pleasing everybody by running around if training for the olimpic games. Great experience.",positive
Excellent breakfast and location is exactly in Brussels City Centre.,positive
"The ist room was  small,

The service was excellent. The staff pleasant and kind and efficient",positive
The host Kathleen was the best host I have ever experienced so helpful and spoke very good English. Slept so beautifully as the area is lovely and quiet. The whole B&B was so cosy and romanatic. The breakfast was so delicious a lot of it homemade. Loved having a sauna in the room. Just could not fault our stay at all and would definitely stay again if in this area.,positive
"Very nice, helpful staff. Comfortable bed. Great shower. Close to the old town, yet quiet.",positive
"Paid parking 9am to 6am. Can park for free a short walk away and parking free overnight during the week.,

Location brilliant -right in centre of historic town. Room small but comfortable. Breakfast great Although choice limited. Reasonably priced",positive
"Well, the floors are creaking and it is true that the house is not very sound-proof. That didn't bother me apart from the fact that I didn't bring my headphones and had to listen to music as low as humanly possible.,

The location is great despite looking at the map it might look like a little out. All is really good there and it is very easy to find. That is not always true in some places.",positive
"I have no complaints,

Very Comfortable apartment excellent host and a few lovely little unexpected touches thrown in. I would highly recommend this property so much so I will definitely be staying again.",positive

Perfect location. Excellent breakfast. bed very comfortable. Staff responded to request for extra pillow immediately with no fuss.",positive
"I loved everything, from the luminous entrance with all cristals around to the decoration, the artistic atmosphere and style of the the enviroment, to the excellent service, very kind, to the very good breakfast and the cossy rooms...we will stay again, for sure¡ the best hotel in Antwerp¡¡¡¡",positive
"The food served in the restaurants was quite expensive and not great quality. There also seemed to be a lot of cars on the site which made it difficult to cycle with the kids. We couldn't use any of the booking reference provided to us on the Centre Parcs APP, which meant we could not pre book any events, bikes etc. This turned out to be quite a negative as a lot of the things on offer such as rock climbing and hiring bikes where fully booked by the time we turned up.,

Accommodation was clean and in a nice setting. Aqua Mondo was great, Staff were nice, and there were plenty of playgrounds for the kids to use.",positive
"There was no single thing I didn't like during my stay there. ,

Beautiful studio with all the necessary amenities for a great stay. Nice and quiet location. Sandra - the proprietor - is amazing!",positive
"Secure parking good but 15 euros a night more than one usually pays in city centreBreakfast adequate but also not really worth 15 euros,

A quirky property which is a former monastery a couple of blocks from the main historic sights. Rooms stylish and comfortable with great bathrooms. Only recently opened and a few housekeeping blips need sorting but I'm sure they will soon be resolved. Reception staff very competent and helpful",positive

"Fabulous Apartment,  right in the centre of town.  Wonderful facilities and a great  host.  Perfect  space for a brief stay  in Ypres,  a really  high  standard of fixtures and fittings + a lovely  'welcome package'  of wine,  beer and water.  Also, two  fabulous balconies which  would be perfect  for a relaxed evening later in the year!  Cold and rainy  when I visited... I genuinely couldn't fault anything, if only  all  aprtments were as good as this!  Very much  look forward to  returning . Top  job all  round!",positive

"There is that thing about Center parks that you have to pay for everything extra (thats what you get used to) but one very unnecessary payment of €4.50 for using a pram stations?!?!?! I was quite appalled by it!,

We had lovely time at centre parcs Vossemren Flanders. The swimming pool was great, and food court yard as well. Food was acceptable both at the restaurant and the swimming pool (could be a better selection of healthier option).We stayed at the hotel in 2 different rooms. One of the rooms was modern- downstairs(almost like its been done) the other room was on the top level - there was nothing wrong with it just a bit dated but beds were comfortable and both balconies had a great view. Breakfast at the hotel was great -had a lovely selection of continental and cooked breakfast and it was included in the price of the stay in the hotel.I will recommend this place and we will definitely return.",positive
"It’s a bit outside the city center (approx 20–25 minutes walking), but we didn’t mind at all since we were able to park our car in the property’s garage. :),

The property was super cute and charming, and Sandra was super friendly, communicative, and accommodating. We drove to Ghent and she kindly let us park our car in her garage, and even went ahead and dropped our hotel key off at the restaurant where we had lunch reservations. Would definitely go back!",positive

While at the train station, I accessed my receipt and realised I was billed for city taxi twice which I never used;  breakfast was billed twice yet I had indicated I was to have breakfast once. Otherwise, the rest looked ok.,

Employees are so nice, especially the lady in the restaurant who provide heating tea pot and microwave service. So we can always have hot water and heated food for not waste. Really appreciate.",positive
"The room was very cold and clinical, no character or warmth, very small bath/shower and the glass walls of the bathroom do not give any privacy, it was obvious that the hotel was built on a budget, stark white lighting in hallways etc makes it feel more like an office than a hotel. We stayed in room 209 and every morning from approx 8am we could hear alot of noise i would assume from cleaning staff above us (sounded like tables or chairs being dragged over the concrete above our room, this lasted for hours, very disappointing as me and my partner love to sleep in. The bed was super soft which was not comfortable, and my partner who has allergies noticed that the room was very dusty.,

Friendly staff, good location, outside courtyard was nice.",negative
"The food at all of the restaurants was not the best. Some of the extra activities were too expensive, considering the price that was already paid to stay. The cottage also got very hot on some days and because there are no screens in the windows we could not just leave the windows open to get some air.,

I liked the location and the access to many different activities. The cottage was also spacious. The staff was very friendly. The water park and discovery park were awesome and my toddler really enjoyed herself. Us parents also enjoyed all the activities.",positive

We had a very stay in this gorgeous facility.  A short 5/10 min walk to historic center.  Far enough to have some quiet.The staff is incredibly nice and helpful.  Ghent is beautiful and I intend to make this my spot when visiting.",positive

-we can not control them another company
-we can not inform you we dont know when they start

"Not many restaurants in the immediate area but with a car reachable within a 10 minute drive.  Regarding the property itself, there is nothing to improve.,

Ample and well furbished room and large bathroom. It wasn't very warm outside when I arrived and I really appreciated that the room was already heated when I arrived. The hosts are very nice and provide lots of information about the area. The breakfast was extensive and made of home made or local products. The property has a library and very nice garden that are free to use.",positive
"The room is too small and compressed. There is no fridge or mini bar in the room, no toiletry provided and there is only a very small table and a chair. It is not really convenient to stay in, unless you are just staying for a short night.,

The location is easily access to different tourist attractions and the room is clean. There is a car park just next to the hotel (Indigo Park) just Costa €18 for 24 hours.",positive

We loved the apartment, the location was just up the road from Cloth Hall and around the corner from Menin Gate. Martine was lovely and welcoming. Two terraces with nice views of old Ypres. It was perfect.",positive

-excellent location for a city tour (but not so close to the train station)-good breakfast, including the opportunity to do your own waffles and make your own orange juice -very friendly service staff (cleaning staff particularly)",positive
"However, value for money was not there for me. I stayed with my colleagues for business the first night and with my partner for the second night. For a work event there is no issue as the location is most important. For a personal get away I found the room no good value for money. The rooms are far too ""minimalistic"" for the amount of money we paid per night. I would not have paid more than 75EUR for that room (we paid <100EUR),

The hotel was in a great location and I have to give it to the terrific staff, very friendly and very helpful. Was pleasure dealing with them throughout the entire stay.",negative
Tried to change dates over a month before. Accommodation available but Center Parcs totally inflexible. Booking.com also inflexible. Both companies blaming each other for not being able to change booking. Feel like we'd been scammed. Not using either ever again.,negative

"The breakfast room and the lounge are, just like in other Motel Ones, too small for the number of rooms. The room was a bit too warm and there was a permanent hum just outside the window so that it couldn't stay open during the night.,

Staff at check-in was very friendly and the process was quick, the room was a typical Motel One room, compact but big enough for a few nights. Breakfast selection was great, everything was fresh and tasty. The bar had many Belgian beers to choose from as well as the typical Motel One choices at an okay price. Parking is available but doesn't belong to the hotel. Reasonably priced with 18 EUR / night.",positive

Martine gave us a wonderful reception and tour of her lovely apartment which is located 2 minutes walk from the main square. The apartment is spotlessly clean and very homely.

"It was magical. So much thought put in every detail in the suite. We stayed at the Belfort Suite (the blue one on the pictures on Booking). It is huge. The bathroom is exceptional. Bed is very comfortable. Due to the high ceilings it is harder to get the room very warm, so have that in mind. We still had a great sleep, since the blankets were extremely warm! The suite looks even better in reality. It was such a pleasure to stay there. Of course nothing for people who can´t live without a TV but they are most probably not going to appreciate this amazing place anyways. Very uncomplicated and pleasant communication with the host. She was so calm and friendly, such an inspiring person. I really cannot understand why would anybody pay more to stay in a big hotel chain, where you get half the space, not even half the luxury and a very impersonal attitude. Breakfast was also exceptional, served in the room. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone travelling to Ghent. Big thank you! Would definitely love to stay there again!",positive
"Why I chose this hotel (and pay a higher rate) was because of the experience of staying in an old monasterium. Our room was in a newly built building in the parking lot next to the street, not in the Monasterium. Even though it was a quiet street, if a car drove by you could hear it and wake you up. Imagine paying to stay at a castle and then that your room is in the shed next to it. The receptionist was zero helpful and zero friendly, it was a really bad experience. All the pictures show the old rooms and the Monasterium, which is what I paid for and at the end we arrived to something completely different.,

I imagine staying at the monasterium is great, but I wouldn't know. It looked really nice.",negative
"The staff were unbelievably kind and friendly. I felt very well looked after and was a lovely place.Big bonus for a last minute, cheap booking on the road.",positive
"Very noisy plumbing and buildings work and checkout staff not attentive.,

Proximity to Metro",negative
"A friend recommended this hotel but for us it's a little off the beaten track. We had to travel an hour from Bastogne to get there but that was our fault for not checking and not the hotels. We were advised to eat at the hotel so we booked dinner, bed and breakfast.  The only issue was that the evening meal was a set menu which was fine but not the fine dining experience of lobster we had been told about and we were not offered an A La Carte menu which we would have been happy to pay extra for.  I'm also not sure why there were tables in the dining room with linen covers and silver service and the conservatory was not to the same standard.  It made us feel slightly like outsiders looking in on the main event.,

The hotel is very comfortable with lovely gardens and a conservatory where we dined. The rooms are clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was good with a very good choice of hot and cold food.",negative

"The staff is not capable of solving any problems that you might encounter during your stay. They do not know how to operate gas heater, do not provide ironing board or iron. Cleaning is below average. Rooms have concrete floor and ceiling, and are very dark. 
Payment policy is the most ridiculous out of all places I’ve been. Property will block full price of your room few weeks in advance before free cancellation period is even over. Then they cancel it and do it again. And even after they had blocked the money, they require payment upfront. We were not able to check in until we paid for all our rooms. I had to pay for the room of one of my colleagues, and after she paid for her room from her credit card the next day, the hotel could not put money back on my card. Unless there are no other places available in Antwerpen, I recommend to look elsewhere, if you don’t want to ruin your vacation or business trip. ,

We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival, since the hotel was fully booked.  The room was very large and comfortable, with warming racks for the towels in the huge bathroom.  We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the hotel restaurant, which was also beautifully decorated for Christmas.  The service was friendly and professional, and the food was outstanding.  We had four different entrees, and everyone raved about their selection.  Breakfast in the morning had a wide selection of breads, pastries, cereals and hot foods, too, though they ran out of bacon and it was never restocked during our meal.",positive

"Park is very run down compared to our last stay. Gardens have not been maintained, leaves are not brushed up. The pond behind cottages ,110 to 150 is nothing more than a black smelly swamp( dangerous) be better filled in and turned into a flat grass play area. 
The glass covering the the pools needs a good cleaning . Activities are very expensive the worst being the cost of cycle hire. Electric BBQ to buy in town €17.00 yet we had to leave a €50.00 deposite for the lend of one.  Side walking gate that accessed the road to the canal dock is permanently chained and locked this could be on a code lock. Home now suffering from a bad chest infection, I suspect the swimming pool water quality. We paid for a towel package however one set of towels was expected to serve us 1 week.  This was our second stay at de vossermeren  and there will not be a third.

"The elevator was a bit dirty and the hall at the ground floor quite smelly (but of course our host was not responsible for that!). Due to cobble stone roads, traffic can be a bit loud. The bedroom however is on the back of the building and you can't hear a thing.,

Perfect tiny, clean and comfortable attic in the heart of Ypres with two beautiful terraces overlooking the roofs and the monuments. Unfortunately it rained and we could not enjoy the outdoor seating, but we can only imagine how pleasant it must be to sit outside and enjoy the view while sipping coffee or some wine. The apartment on the 5th floor is small but very functional. The host is extremely kind and helpful. Even left some breakfast in the fridge and lots of books and maps to visit the war sites. Very easy to find street parking just outside the main door. The apartment is next to all attractions, including the Menin Gate, the cathedral, shops and restaurants. It's a great place and we will definitely go back.",positive
"Wake up by early morning trams outside the hotel.  Breakfast is simple and has not much choices.,

Excellent location, close to all interesting points.  I had a wonderful walk after the dinner and enjoyed the quiet and relaxed mood at the square just outside the hotel. Waffle self-making in breakfast is quite interesting.",positive
Great location and Very nice staff!,positive
"My only suggestion is to make the breakfast earlier than the 8am start. ,

I enjoyed meeting the manager of the hotel who looked like Lurch from The Adams Family who effortlessly navigated the low doorways. We received the room facing the road with the Bay window, which provided an enjoyable place to retreat to late at night.",positive
"Buildings around having alot of construction work so come 7am it's very loud!! We also requested an early check in that was accepted  before hand but when we arrived they couldn't accommodate,

"Nothing,

Hope to return some time😊",positive
"The place is clean enough, but it needs some upgrading, the bathroom is a bit old, the shower is loose, the carpet is a bit dirty ,

It's in the middle of the historical center of Brugge, near everything, the staff are very polite and smiley.",positive
Excellent location. The deluxe rooms offer a bathtub worth the small extra.,positive
"Booked a Superior room based on the Booking Web site photos to get the best quality room. But on arrival given a room no better than Standard in quality. Management said all rooms different, but I said that the room paid for should still be of a similar Superior standard to that advertised. They blamed Booking.com for this but I don't. Very misleading - be warned! Make certain you are going to get what you are paying for!,

Location for exploring Ghent",negative

"24/7 means open all times not the case here they shut the front door around 8:30pm and it’s a nightmare to check in after! Not all the rooms have air conditioning that’s a bit of a joke. No celling light in the bedroom leaves the rooms pretty dark. Breakfast a rip off. Best avoid ,

Nothing!",negative

This is an outstanding property in terms of location and what it offers. An evening drink onto the terrace was a bonus. This is one of those rarely found gems.,positive
"soaps and shampoo could be betterbed wasnt terribly comfortable but ok,

it was all pretty good, the room was basic but clean, the shower was powerful, and had a late checkout time too",positive
Great friendly staff. The complimentary snacks and drinks,positive
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is excellent just on the edge of the old center so it’s also quiet. Very modern facilities but the historic feel is fully maintained. We were allowed to leave our car parked after checking out so we could spend some extra time around town.,positive
"Nothing - everything was perfect.,

This is our second stay in Atrium and once again everything was perfect. Martine is a very friendly and helpful host. Location is excellent and the apartment has wonderful views over the city.The hosts have thought of everything to make the stay a pleasant one - comfortable bed, wonderful terrace to enjoy the sunshine.....we will be back again.",positive

Excellent, due to great location. Clean rooms. Good Breakfast. Good Value. Fairly close to tram for transportation to the train station.",positive

Location was excellent. All areas in Antwerp were reachable by foot in a few minutes. Breakfast was ok, although there was not too much no choice. Clean and comfortable. Slept well.",positive

Very charming and delicious breakfast. Super friendly owners.,positive
"Staff on arrival not v welcoming although think he was restaurant staff not hotel. He didn't even tell us where breakfast was served or mention the serving hours. Room served in a little tricky to find, we weren't the only ones who didn't nearly find it,

Great location. Hotel a little dated but great character. Really good breakfast included. Kettle in the room a good addition. Owner always present at breakfast and really attentive.",positive
The sleep on couch was old and very hard,negative
"Very good value for money. Very good breakfast. It is worth a 5 stars hotel. Kindness of the hosts. Ideally situated between Gent and Antwerp. We visited Gent on day and Antwerp the other one. This was a very good option for us, instead of staying in expensive hotel in the middle of the city.",positive
"Squeaky floors, and noisy plumbing can get in the way of a long nights sleep. Rooms are small, but adequate.,

A great location on the corner of the Market Square. The self-service breakfasts are good, bacon/eggs, fruit/yogurt, ham/cheese & smoked salmon. There is a restaurant for evening meals - great for carnivores. There are numerous bars and restaurants within easy walking, and the Cloth Hall, and the Menin Gate are both very close.",positive

Small room,positive
"The main bathroom does not have a real separation from the rest of the space (the apartment is organised in multiple levels and one is the bathroom) and this may an issue depending on the level of privacy you want to have if you are not travelling alone.,

The apartment looks newly renovated and it is organised in a really pleasant way. It is well furnished and we particularly appreciated the fact that everything (from furniture to cutlery) looks new. The host was very approachable to talk about the check-in and the property.",positive
"If anything, the lack of shower gel.,

Breakfast was amazing, room very comfortable and spotlessly clean.",positive
"Cot could have been prepared for when we arrived, but that was a minor annoyance that was fixed quickly.  Bathroom could have been bigger for the size of the room, but again, this wasn't a deal breaker on the comfort of our stay.,

This is a very well positioned hotel, sitting right on the Ypres Market Square.  From here you have the Menin Gate, In Flanders Fields Museum and Visitor Information right on your doorstep.  The hotel is perfectly located for restaurants in the Market Square.  There is no onsite parking, but plenty of parking on the Market Square - just make yourself familiar with the parking charges and times.*Top Tip* If you're attending the Last Post ceremony at the Menin Gate, find somewhere to eat early as it can be difficult to find places still serving after the ceremony (at around 8.30).  Although we were a small family, we were in a large family room which could sleep up to 6.  The room was clean, although the bathroom was a little small given the size of the room and the number of people it sleeps.  In the morning, there was a good choice of food in the well appointed breakfast room.  The management was helpful.  We had a cot in the room but hadn't been supplied with sheets for it.  When raised with the Manager, he sorted it out straight away. Overall, this was a good place to stay in Ypres, particularly for a family with small children, and a good base from which to see Ypres and Belgian Flanders.",positive
"We had a wonderful stay here, the apartment was spotless and our hosts were very welcoming and friendly. We were so happy we could bring our dog and we had a lovely enclosed garden for her to walk around in. Would love to come back.",positive
"Staff at the reception was very ""robotic"", certainly too busy to properly reply to your questions. Even though I fully paid my stay with debit card at check-in, they still temporarily charged my credit card at check-in (not to mention I already gave credit card number at booking stage...). Never happens to me, and I travel a lot. The biggest failure was that one towel smelled like someone was cleaning cigarette ash trays before washing - very bad smell, disgusting. I certainly expected more from a hotel in that price-range.,

The location was nice, check-in and check-out was smooth. Free coffee with coffee-machine and water in the room was a nice gesture, appreciate it. Bathroom was nice.",negative

Modern bathroom, clean bed, and other facilities are perfectly great!",positive
"Sound proof is bad,

Excellent hosts",positive
"Very small room for family of 4. Not as nice or spacious as internet photos would suggest. Have to say, we were travelling with a small dog, so probably weren’t allocated best room. Stayed on a Monday night. Disappointed that hotel restaurant and bar were closed that evening.,

Spacious rooms, lots of character and very good location. The staff were also very friendly and helpful.",positive

Loved the bed!,positive
Fabulous house and a very warm welcome from Erwin and Luuk who were keen to share their enthusiasm for the conversion and their new B & B venture.  Breakfast was lovely and beautifully presented.,positive
"Parking was a big challenge at arrival. No places anywhere nearby. Ended up taking the care a bit far and even then potentially illegal, and waking up very early to move it before anyone would complain. Luckily by then many places at the main square were free.,

A fabulous location at the main square of Ypres, with the cathedral and the rathaus right next to the place. Restaurant downstairs. Reasonably priced, considering the location.",positive
"We were not informed about refurbishments taking place which meant a very noisy awakening and a messyentrance way. Also we had to leave earlier than planned because road works closed the exit road so we had togo before this happened. Previously, we have enjoyed our meals at Monasterium but this time we found it tooexpensive to eat there.,

We love the whole atmosphere of the Monasterium which was enhanced this time by haunting music coming from the Chapel because of a visiting choral group.",positive

The staff was very helpful and kind!,positive
"Marvelous place two steps from the center of Hamme, with an inner terrace where you can relax and take a drink. The building is incredibly renovated with attention to the smallest details. But the atmosphere, the warmth is incomparable, from the rooms but for most from the two owners, who care for guests as if you were long time friends.",positive
"Both hotel and rooms are quite small (okay for 2 people); manager was not always available,

Location was great (right on Ypres central square); free parking in the square (1800-0900); lots of pleasant restaurants in immediate area; excellent base for exploring nearby WWI battlefields.  (The battlefields are well set-up for exploring by bike or extended hiking - highly recommended.)",negative

Great location , staff were lovely and it was well worth the cost of the room . Wine in the bar was lovely too and we were given snacks which were delightful .",positive

We stayed for two nights in the hotel and everything was perfect.
Andreas made the check-in in the reception and he was really polite and helpful, he answered to all our questions and give us all needed information about the hotel facilities and tips for the city. For this reason directly due to the really nice welcoming of Andreas our stay in the hotel began really positive. Thank you!
The hotel is located centrally and also has an awesome cafe/bar area. The rooms are clean and equiped with all the needed.
I would recommend the hotel and definetely book it again.",positive

This place is a gem! Fabienne is a fantastic hostess. You can see she put a lot of herself in designing Le Temps de l’Ivresse. The loft is cosy, extremely well equipped.  Everything is outstanding: the decor, the comfort of the sofa and beds, the amazing selection of books, the accessories and the personal touches such as apple juice produced locally. Did I mention that there is a great view from the upper floor? I will definitely be back.",positive
"Vertiginous staircase up to the eaves where our bed was located and beams you had to duck under. We didn't hit our heads or fall down the stairs, but the arrangement wasn't really suited to OAPs like us!,

Unusual, charming and fascinating place. Excellent breakfast. very helpful staff. Large, quiet bedroom.",positive
"The food selection was fantastic at breakfast and well presented, however, the hot food had gone cold- the heating lamps do not seem to keep the food warm e.g. scrambled eggs, bacon and mushrooms.,

The greeting from staff at the reception desk and breakfast was the most friendly and helpful that I've experienced in many years of traveling. Our booking request for a room with a view was also provided without us having to ask again, which can often the case. The hotel decor is fresh, fun and everywhere is immaculately clean. The holiday decorations for the Christmas/New Year period were an added pleasant touch in the reception area. The location is beneficial as it is between the railway station to the airport and at the top of the central shopping district (10 mins walk to Grand Place), which is actually more convenient than staying in a hotel beside Grand Place.",positive
"There's no wardrobe, but only hooks,

I stayed only one night at Motel One, so I cannot say much. However, I can certainly state that room and bathroom were perfectly fine and extremely clean. Remarkable shower, thumbs up! Quality sleep. I particularly appreciated the fact of being hosted in a room facing the inner courtyard and not the street - which is a busy street. The hotel is well located, short walking distance from the central train station, metro stations and all amenities. Certainly recommended!",positive
"Room and bathroom pretty basic.,

Good breakfast., great location right in central Ypres.",positive
"The hosts are very friendly and spontaneous. We felt home at the first minute.

"There was no airconditioning in the room, just a fan. With 30 C degrees outside, it was not very pleasant to be in the room. There is no minibar in the room, so we couldn’t keep our drinks and food cold. The dinner in the restaurant was OK, but not worth the price. Besides this, we had a nice stay!,

"Rental bikes right a the appartment to start to Namur and surrounding would a be perfect supplement :-),

Very cozy place; arranged and furnished by heart! Perfectly located if you want to be close to Namur, with local growers, bike and running trails around but not in the trouble of the center.

In our last night restaurant was closed, according to them to *organize the menu for the summer'. It's ridiculous that you closed the restaurant on Jul 1st for that reason. They provided a list with alternative restaurants in the area but all of them were closed, so not a good last night dinner ,

Location is simply perfect. Installations are ideal with plenty of activities to do. Everything was clean and comfortable and working perfectly. To recommend. We'll come back",positive

Breakfast is a real treat and the afternoon drinks in the cafe or by the pool are fine moments to share 'restaurant and other tips'  with other guests.  The hosts are very welcoming and make you feel at home by the sea.",positive
"Size of room , though I know the Ibis style of hotels and I have stayed many times, still sometimes rooms come a bit more comfortable, i.e Ibis in Vienna and Ibis in Strasbourg, they are of the same league-I mean not Ibis budget, nor Ibis styles-but still the rooms are a bit bigger,

The perfect location, right in the centre of the town square",positive

"The house faces the street and the outside table is actually in the sidewalk. However, it is still nice to have it. The thermostat of the heating system can only be set between 19 and 21 degrees Celsius. Fortunately, as this is not enough for many people during the winter, there is an air conditioning unit on the bedroom that can be used for heating. It does dry the air a bit and is not located in the best place for heating. Since the apartment is highly ""technological"" it would be nice to have some instructions available to know how to use things. Also, some kitchen paper could be useful, especially for people that are staying only for a few days and are not planing to carry so many things or spending too much time in supermarkets. The walls are thin. We were luck and did not have immediate neighbours - or at least not noisy ones - but one could clearly listen through the walls.,

Before our stay I contacted the owner twice to ask about the temperature of the shower (there were comments mentioning a problem with it) and about the availability of bikes in the area. The owner/manager answered very quickly and in a very satisfying way. Indeed the shower issue was solved and we could use bikes for free during our stay. This last point made our stay particularly pleasant. The bikes were very decent and we could enjoy the area. Before the arrival, we also received information on available take-aways and food deliveries. This was very useful, especially during this semi-lockdown, and I recommend ordering breakfast from the suggested people. The apartment was pleasant and well furnitured. Good amount of towels and amenities. The small sauna in the bathroom is an asset, especially considering this is a small apartment for 2 guests. There was a coffee machine (as described) and a few coffee pads, which I very much appreciated. There were 2 small bottles of water in the fridge which was also a nice gesture. TV, wifi, sound system in the shower, etc were fully working and good quality. You can check in and out at any time following the instructions you receive prior to your stay. The location is ideal to go for bike rides and visit some natural parks.  Ideal if you want a break for your busy (yet currently boring) days in a big city!",positive
"The breakfast was a bit basic.
The last night of our stay, the restaurant reopened after being closed for several months due to covid and the evening was a bit of an unorganized chaos. We understand that it was all new and weren't too upset but we really hope for future guests that they'll get better organized,

We liked the view and the BBQ they arranged due to covid restrictions. The pool and that whole area was great and there's a lot of great hiking trips you can do in the area. The staff was very helpful and friendly.",positive

By the sound of the other reviews I think we received one of their newly refurbished rooms. The room was very modern, updated and clean. It came with a coffee machine and little fridge as well.

Very centrally located. Nice little flat for a short stay.  Shops, restaurants, etc. all within easy walking distance. Proprietors were dealt with remotely but were pretty efficient in responding to queries. Codes instead of keys was quite handy.",positive

Clean and comfortable room, absolute friendly owners who serve you a delicious breakfast. We would really recommend this place.",positive
Good facilities very clean and modern apartment in a quiet location and still only 15 min drive to Maastricht centre. Private parking. Perfect for families and couples. There is a cycle path to Maastrich in an amazing scenary by the river. Marc our host was great. Highly recommended.,positive
"Just the problem with the stroller of our new born. There were some stairs to get to our room. And the floor made a lot of crackling noise when we walked and baby's sleep was disturbed.,

Once I stepped in they showed me around the jacuzzi, infrored cabin, the kitchen and my room, moreover I received the suggestion where to go in the city for walk and restaurants to eat. Inside the Red&Breakfast many beautiful and unique pieces of art, handmade from local artists, which really makes a ""Wow"" effect. In reality this guest house was better then on pictures. The rooms are clean, and the jaccuzy just made my evening. The location is about 7 min of walk to the city center. Definitely would be happy to stay again!",positive
"We enjoyed our stay but found the meals in the rooms uncomfortable. I understand its covid and very much appreciated the option to buy food from the hotel and take it to our rooms. However, I was in a room with 3 people that only had 1 chair and a bed on the ground so it was awkward to eat in our beds. ,

The use of the outdoor spa pool, sauna and mini golf was a real upside!

Excellent breakfast and fantastic location.,positive
"Very minimal kitchen equipment (besides, dish washer did not work), not extremely clean, bathroom not quite impressive either, but hey, it's really just fine for a short city trip,

Location is close to the opera, really central, apartment is spacious (living room), check-in went just well with the codes that I was sent, parking is possible in garages nearby (around 14 euros per day), large TV",negative
"Nothing!,

Wonderful breakfast. Nothing was too much bother for the hosts, they were so kind, friendly and helpful. Lots of thoughtful extra little touches.",positive
"Our room didn’t have a lot of natural light so it didn’t really make us feel like spending much time there.,

Fantastic property and facilities, staff were super friendly.",positive
"Nothing! ,

Everything! Location was perfect! Right in the heart of the city! Squeaky clean! Paid parking garage to use was super close and we left our car their the duration of our stay so no need to drive anywhere! And I liked the security. I felt completely safe and I was not worried about my belongings while running around the city. I would stay again and again at this place!",positive

Central but just outside the busy part!",positive
"The families room 303 loo washroom / shower was a bit too cramped.
Could have done with a room fan for the hot sticky night, should have asked really,  my mistake.
Would have liked to have been able to book in earlier than 16:00 hrs, however booking out is 11:00 hrs.,

The room it's self was clean and tidy with little to no out side noise heard. There's  kitchen extractor flume close to the window... We had the room window wide open all night, with no problem or kitchen smells.
Being the upper / top floor it's was lovely and  quiet, we didn't really hear any other guests on our floor or using the lift. Rooms dosnt really have a view of the towns square as it rear facing... 
A cracking guesthouse / hotel which is located within the main square. 
The breakfast was amazing with an excellent selection of breakfast items. This is a continental  breakfast with ample fresh fruit,  meats, cheese, salmon, jams, spreads, 3 different types of fresh bread rolls as much tea, coffee, orange juice and water to drown yourself in, with the benefit of cooking your own boiled eggs also the opportunity to have fresh scrambled egg and bacon.",positive
"Plumbing in bathroom had a terrible smell,

Great location, modern finishes in apartment",positive
"Very nice Bed and Breakfast with comfortable and ""artistic"" rooms, very friendly owners, excellent breakfast!",positive
"relatively small room painted dark khaki green. Makes you think the walls are coming at you. We were located in the Ecuries. I'd suggest a light colour when rpainting the wall. Except for this remark, tidy, clean, bathroom very ok. I suppose it's also a matter of taste....Of course in COVID period we had to spend more time than we liked in our room during evenings....,

Fluid check-in, easy to find, very nice and clean place, well maintained. professional service. Kitchen (take away in these days) was excellent ! Superb region !",positive
"At night it is very noisy, but if you close the double-glazed windows you hear almost nothing.,

It is a big apartment in the very center of Brussels. The apartment was clean, well equipped with bed sheet set, towels, kitchen towel, hygiene products. Also the kitchen is well equipped and everything is functioning. We were there with 2 adults  2 adolescents but the apartment is big enough for 6 persons, when using the large and easy to handle bed couch in the living room. The apartment is very safe: during the day there are 2 locking doors and at night 3 locking doors. Philippe and Esmara are very friendly.",positive
"The room is not really soundproof so there was a lot of outside noise. Also the windows (in the room I was staying at) look directly at an office space. It would be great to have some foil in front of the windows for privacy. Finally, the breakfast could benefit from some hot iyems like boiled eggs.,

The location was great and very central. Also the girl at the front desk was very helpful with restaurant recommendations.",negative

The bar was pretty good and the water and the breakfast!",positive
"The room was adequate and clean but very compact, anything carried out in the bathroom needed careful planning, except a face wash and teeth cleaning! A 3 night stay became a bit waring.,

Location & Breakfast, we spent little time in the hotel and ate out.",positive
"We are disappointed that Smart Flats allows prostitution in their apartments (google search: Eva prostitution Liege - on the pictures you can see a Smart flats apartment with roof terrace) . We came across (in the elevator and hallway) different clients who where not wearing any mask as this brought a higher risk of COVID-19. Smart Flats is aware of the situation, but find it not necessary to act on this matter.For future guests with Smart Flats be aware that there is a chance of coming across prostitution and/or their clients.,

Location is in the city center.",negative

"The location of our room was not ideal, next to the staff's room, who started the day early and were a bit noisy. ,

We came to spend a long weekend here with our friends with teenager kids. There are so many facilities here that we had a fantastic time here without moving out of the domain. 
Even on a rainy, cold day we could enjoy the heated pool and the sauna, and the kids could choose from the many board games offered by the domain. 
All Corona- related measures are in place, I felt secure during our stay.",positive
"Very good location, comfortable and clean, nice and helpful owners.",positive
"We didn’t know that we couldn’t eat in the breakfast room before booking it but the room had a nice set up and we could eat there comfortably.,

We got upgraded to the junior suite which was a really nice surprise. The breakfast was nice though it would’ve been nice to have options like fish and chicken for the non-ham eaters.",positive
"The room was quite small, there was no where to sit, other than on the bed (only 1 chair provided in a double room). Some fittings looked cheap - thin lino on the floor and damaged skirting boards (looked like there had been a flood from the bathroom). We stayed in room 327.,

The location was brilliant, everything was on your doorstep to see the sights of Ghent.",positive

Staff very friendly and attentive. Evening meals were very good - best steak I've had in ages!",positive
Simple great in service,positive
"Room was on the street side and hence quite noisy at night. You can hear trains, cars and people. Ask for a room in the backyard where it's more quiet.,

Very nice people that make you feel good. Nice furniture, nice architecture, nice rooms.",positive

Best bed all week! Good breakfast. Perfect location",positive
"Bruyant,

La situation excellente",negative
"Milk in room for early tea!,

The hosts were extremely helpful and very kind.",positive
"The room we were staying in was ""newly renovated"" but sadly completely lacked any character what so ever. As if someone tried to put together a room by picking different styles from an interior magazine, trying to make it look cool and trendy but completely messing up by mixing everything. I wish the room had the atmosphere of the old buildings we were staying in. Also the road to exit the grounds was badly damaged.,

Many facilities were included such as bikes, games, the spa area, mini golf and much more. The breakfast was alright, nothing special. They made sure the stay was as comfortable as possible with the current restrictions, so they set up a shop to meet all your needs.",positive
"Everything was perfect.  Very cute,  clean apartment. Nearby parking garage.  Right by the center",positive
"The pillows. Even though we received extra pillows they are way too soft, it would be great if the hotel could offer more pillows variety. The airco made a lot of noise making hard to sleeep.,

The room is small but very nice with a beautiful decoration and very comfy beds. The location is great and the staff was helpful and very friendly",positive
"Room a bit small, but in general it’s ok for Ibis chain and very good central location ,

Good location, reasonable prices, nice fully breakfast.  The bed was good, clean and soft linens. Welcoming stuff. The hotel parking was fully booked ( we didn’t get reservation in advance), but concierge recommended good public parking 2 min. distance by foot.",positive

Breakfast had a wide variety . Clean",positive
"Very centrally locatedLarge comfy apartmentGood ShowerEasy CheckinCar park nearbyEverything worked, nothing was broken",positive
"It is the most satisfactory accommodation of our trip. The room was clean and beautifully decorated. Location is convenient. The hostess Nicola is talented, talkative and helpful. The host Michel has good taste in recommending scenic spots. Breakfast is extra charged but plentiful and tasty.",positive
"The shag carpet was a little 70's kitch. The TV reception was flakey. The breakfast was not worth the 14 Euro. The coffee machine was not working for multiple days. There are no refrigerators or microwaves in the room, yet if you can manage to bring your own breakfast and french press, you will be fine. There is a microwave in the convenience shop and a kettle in the room. Do to COVID, the Sauna's are not operational and the bar with the fabulous selection of beer is closed. The value for money was not great, yet for a nice place to go for New Year's Eve in COVID times, it was in fact worth it.,

Beautiful Domaine. Wonderful atmosphere. Good opportunities for hiking. Great Place for a get away, not so far from Brussels. The heated pool was amazing (when there were not too many Children splashing around). The bathrooms were well renovated. The staff were friendly and the dinners were good. All plates and cutlery are biodegradable, so let's hear it for sustainability. I would suggest some over 18 time slots for the pool, e.g. 9-11h and 19-21h.",positive
"There is limitation on the check in time, so may be not the best choice if your arrive late.,

Great location, the room was spacious, the bed was comfy, kitchen are sufficiently equipped. Philippe was really attentive.",positive
"The pillows. Everything else was great, but the pillows are just terrible. Nothing too traumatic, but maybe good to check is the smell coming from the pipes in the bathroom, it has a foul smell. We just closed the bathroom door and solved, but good to look at.,

The rooms are small but modern and very convenient. The location is fantastic and the staff was very friendly. The bed is quite big and is very comfortable. Overall the hotel has a modern, hip and cozy ambiance. The rain shower is so nice!",positive
"Property could do with a little TLC, spot of paint here & there.,

Fantastic location & good bar with very helpful staff.",positive
"The rooms are a bit small, but very clean and comfortble,

Great hotel! Close to everything, Grande palace is in 10 minuts walking, ""hoop on hoop off"" stops just infront of the hotel, 5 min walking from the main train.. just perfect location! The rooms are clean, very nice and comfortble, staff is so nice and polite! Had a wonderful stay thanks to this hotel!",positive
The atmosphere at the hotel is lively and accommodating . Great place to relax after a day exploring Brussels City Centre. Excellent Bar and Bar service staff. I really enjoyed my stay there.,positive
"Very little ventilation in room, but it was unseasonably hot weather. You would need fans or Aircon if staying for more than a night.,

A lovely big room with nice personal touches like sweets on each bed. Breakfast was really nice with  pley of choice. The place was right on the main square, near to everything in the centre and plenty of places to eat. Parking isn't difficult either. Recommended",positive
"How intimate and comfortable place to stay in 
My sister and I loved it 
And Jolly was really welcoming and friendly 
We had a really good time",positive
"Parking is free around the place, but not very easy to find a spot as it is a residential area,

Staff extremely kind and welcoming, room very clean. They even brought us an extra pair of towels without us asking. Literally below the highway exit so very easy to find",positive
Nice castle stay,positive
"A very clean and cosy apartment, located in the heart of Brussels. Very good hospitality aswell. Great experience.",positive
car parking,negative
"No safe in the room. Room temperature a bit warm - heater turned itself back on when we turned it off overnight! If you're a light sleeper and going when the Christmas market is on, ask for a room at the back of the hotel (we could clearly hear the market until  around 11.30pm and then trams in the early morning - but this noise didn't bother us).,

Friendly and helpful staff. Excellent location right in the centre of town, and great view from our window. Room was clean and comfortable. It was exactly what one would expect from an Ibis hotel.",positive
So central,positive
Fantastic place for time to rest after work meetings. Perfect location (next to the St Michael and St Gudula Cathedral). Thanks! Keep it that great :),positive
"Ensuite facilities very cramped. Decoration was very tired.,

Excellent location. Good public parking available close at hand and at reasonable cost. Good breakfast.",negative
"We was let down with the apartment itself. It did not match with the images we had seen on Booking.com. The pictures show a nice apartment, but that's not the case. Furniture on the rooftop broken, broken glasses and chipped mugs in the cupboard, stained sofa, wires everywhere, broken mirror in the bathroom, stained and dirty towels, dirty toilets, empty handsoaps in the bathroom.,

Location is great, as it is in the centre.",negative
"Clean and comfortable, very friendly staff!!",positive
"Smelled like smoke as the neighbours were smoking outside next to our door. ,

The whole area around is gorgeous! Unique place.",positive
Phillippe is very helpfull and best apartment host so far. Great location but little bit noisy at night because its next to pub.,positive
I specially asked about my dog. I was suprized i had to pay 20 euro extra. There was no information on the website and i did not get any aswere from them when i asked in advance,negative
"The bathroom had some really dirty stains in the far corners.,

The location in the middle of Gent was great.",positive
"the superior room is spacious but the use of the space is awkward, very little space for your clothes, int the bathroom the rack for towels is just above the shelve, so they cannot be properly hanged, you get a dressing gown, but there nowhere hooks to hang them, you need to lie down on the floor to use the safe as it is just at that level, plugs are at locations useless for your computer use unless the cables become traps when you walk. The choice of colors is cold (grey and green) and the bathroom materials on the cheap side. If you like to take part in the life on the street, rejoice, the quality of the insulation of the building allows you to enjoy the noise of the street works during the day and the sirens of police/ambulances during all night,

the staff is courteous and efficient",negative
"Breakfast room was overwhelmed at busy times.,

Good location, pleasant lobby & bar, nice room.",positive
"Nothing really, it was a good inexpensive hotel in a prime location.,

Comfy bed, small but practicle room. Overlooking the main square, only 150 meters from Museams and the Menin Gate. Public parling outside in the square is inexpensive.",positive

Location ideal",positive

"The stay in the hotel was really a very nice experience. The staff was very polite. We arrived at the hotel around 9:30 AM and although the time for check-in is scheduled for 2 PM the receptionist, Radovane, was so polite to give us a room. Great facilities and super great location. I'll choose this hotel again when I visit Brussels in the future.",positive

Perfect location, nice and quiet with the windows shut despite central location",positive
"Very pleasant place,  very comfortable,  more personal than standard hotel. I will be back soon",positive
"We travelled for my partner's anniversary: I booked a superior room and I wrote to the hotel to double-check that we have a nice room. However, the room we got looked a bit basic and had no bathtub, which is challenging with a young child. The furniture was quite shabby and we had two extra beds that we didn't need. I would have preferred if they wouldn't call this room 'superior', but rather a 'room with a view' and paid more attention to clients' requests especially if someone comes for a special occasion. In general I found other reviews suggesting that the food is overpriced and rooms in the castle quite basic to be accurate. Nevertheless, the location makes these things not too important if you want a relaxing long weekend in a family-friendly place.,

The surroundings are gorgeous and it's an excellent place to stay with kids. Playgrounds, games and activities are also very helpful if you travel with children. Staff was very friendly and we had a nice view from our room. Baby cot was available for free. They made an effort to make some food availble to eat in the rooms due to Covid measures and a small shop with free coffee and snacks to buy. A kettle in the room was also very helpful.",positive
"Slightly tired decor that needs updating.,

Excellent location, large apartment, quiet, comfy bed,",positive
Alles was top,positive
"Other visitors enjoying Ghent nightlife came around 4 PM with a lot of noise in de stairways. Not the fault of the hotel off course.,

The hotel is directly in the center of Ghent. This means that it's very nice to go for a walk in de city centre. Everything is nearby! On the other hand, we forgot to book a place in the car park of the hotel so we had to search for another one. 15 minute walk with luggage was not very pleasant.  Hotel staff was very polite though! Breakfast was very good! Room was a bit noisy but doable for one night.",positive
"There was construction all around the hotel and booking.com did not mention that which I found very decieving. After I complained to booking.com I received a call from a very polite young man who said that they contacted the hotel and that the hotel will be in touch with me. Of course the hotel did not get in touch with me and the staff had no idea what I was talking about and couldnt care less. At the check in I had to change the room 2 times because the rooms were not clean or had a defekt.",negative
"Staff was kind and helpful. Motel is very close to city center and specially to train station, location is great. Loby is like a pub :) Happy people were enjoying... I stayed there last weekend, then i travelled out of Brussels in weekdays, i just booked this motel again for next two days. That means i am already happy with staying here, so i book second time...",positive
"Very nice owners, they also wanted to help in booking a nice restaurant. The 'wentelteefje', sweet pastry as a surprise when having breakfast was also very tasteful.Nice atmosphere, on walking distance of city center. Nice to have a walk with good wheather (which we had)!",positive

View and Spa are excellent Friendly staff",negative

"Excellent modern rooms, quiet surroundings and overall very comfortable. Rich breakfast. I was planning to stay only one night and ended up staying 3. Michel and Nicole are wonderful hosts, had great ideas for sightseeing in Liège and were a great support. Great value for money. Perfect.",positive
"Walking routes could have been clearer and better described. Food was extremely disappointing, and honestly for the price a stark rip-off (though the wine great!). The look and feel of the castle is nice, however hostel-like vibes with no decorations, flowers or service at the table at the bar. My room smelled, I ended up having mosquitos as I had to open my window for the smell. My head bed wall shook whenever the neighbour opened or closed their door, and I could hear them - even as I asked for a quiet room. This explains the 3 star rating probably. I also asked for a big bed, and got 2 singled pushed together, including singles bedding. Floor was creaky and loud, they should consider investing in the bones of the castle to offer good hotel rooms, or mentioning this somehow. There was no cafe or opportunity to get a drink or food at the wellness area/pool. Except a vending machine that was broke and ate your coins. What I was looking for (peaceful hotel, with a good bed, food and spa to relax and take walks) was not met as well as I had hoped. Felt more like a very elegant hostel if I'm truly honest! Which is fine, if that's the expectation, alas as a boutique hotel I expected more. Needs an update and renovation here and there in my opinion.,

Gorgeous castle, scenery, wine was great, and available info for games, excursions. The spa massages i took (although 3rd party and took a while to set an appointment) was lovely and relaxing and original. The wellness pool area was great, individual saunas cute, and overall Covid measures seemed appropriate. The staff was lovely, though it depended on who ;)",negative
Location was super!,positive
"20 euro extra requested for breakfast
5 euro for a bottle of water,

"In spite of having some problems with the climatisation and some facilities in the room. The staff was up to the circumstances and we received good treat to solve the problems and made our stay more confortable.,

The location was perfect. It is the ideal place to visit the city. The bed was very confortable and the room was big.",positive
"No kettle in room,

Very nice people comfortable and clean good breakfast",positive
"The family lodging was like a dormitory without any charm in contrast to the rest of the place. Just 4 beds little furniture and the ceiling beams at 1.65 m high were like obstacles. So quality for price no what we expected.,

Lovely place to stay with lots of charm. Great balance of activities. Staff very kind and competent.",positive

Nice apartment right in the center of the city.
Super clean! market right around the corner with all that you would need to enjoy the apartment.",positive
"The only thing that bothered me was that the WiFi was only available freely for a day. After that, I would have to pay to use the internet. Considering it is not a very inexpensive hotel, it would be expected that WiFi was available for the whole stay and included in the price of the room,

Very comfortable room and the bathroom was great. The location was amazing, with many restaurants and cafes less than 100m away.",positive
"I can't think of anything,

everything was great :)",positive
"The price was a tad steep...  The photos are beautiful on the website, but we got one of the “meh” rooms.  The room had no view of anything, and was tucked away on the back side of our respective building.  Dinner was also something else...  As with the price of the room, dinner was expensive.  It also took over an hour for us to get our meal because it seemed like they were not ready for the crowd of folks that showed up.  ,

The views from the property are amazing!  There is nothing like just sitting around looking at the chateau you are staying in.  It is gorgeous to look at...  There are also plenty of things to do on the property if you have time.  I.E. pool, bikes, pool tables, walking paths and etc.  The room we had was OK, and the breakfast in the morning was just enough.",negative
"good positio, WIFI and heater are excellent.",positive
All was great!,positive
"Unfortunately the restaurant isn’t open except on Friday and Saturday, and the bar is very unoccupied as well, so besides you might getting hungry, the hotel misses some lively athmosphere. ,

Beautiful scenery! The castle with his rooms on a sunny hill are lovely and relaxing, as well is the brand new spa. Great for a weekend out.",positive
"I have nothing negative to say about our experience.,

Big and spacious.  This apartment was EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAN and a great value in Brussels.  If given the chance to stay here again I would not hesitate to do so.  The staff was also very nice.",positive

I rarely write reviews but as this hotel has everything a seasoned traveller requires thought I would elaborate.  Located right on the Market Square with parking outside.  As hotels go I would mark it 5 star value for money.  The accommodation is not swanky but it is clean, has plenty of hot water, good size shower, a window that opens, very comfortable king size bed, extra pillows, tea/coffee making facilities and very clean.  The breakfast was incredible, possibly the best hotel breakfast I have had in more years than I wish to recall.  We had dinner in the restaurant which also was excellent and as hotel guests were given a welcome drink of our choosing.  The owner and staff were very helpful and friendly and spoke multiple languages.  Can not recommend highly enough.",positive
"Since the rooms are basically built on top of each other row by row, the layout is a bit strange at first sight. Carrying your luggage 2 stairs up and through narrow corridors was a challenge.
The double bed we asked for were twin beds put together with a top mattress. We still had separate blankets, so something didn't add up there.
The breakfast was ok, nothing special.,

The room was nice and clean. It was a bit cold and it took a while before we found out we could regulate the temperature ourselves. The bathroom was clean as well and the shower was (after warming up for 2 minutes) really nice.",negative

"Next time offer complementary rates considering that am a regular customer at Thon. The rooms have been supplied  with compressors which are suitable for making coffee and not when one wants to make tea. Consider providing a kettle in each room.,

It near alot of shopping malls which is just a walking distance from the hotel. In addition, the breakfast is excellent with rooms that are spacious. The flexibility of extending checking out hours was highly appreciated during last trip",positive

"Received an email from the host on Sunday night , by which time we were in France, informing me to bring our own towels? Ah here! The minimum you expect is that sheets and towels are supplied. When we arrived host gave us two small bath towels! Yes one towel each for a two day stay , not acceptable,,,, . Kitchen is modern and empty, empty not a drop of water in the fridge, no condiments, Nothing .  W B’s line about ‘ fumbling in the greasy till and adding the half pence to the pence’ came to mind. Will not be visiting again,

Property is easily accessible and in a quiet area, street being redeveloped so it should be very nice when finished. apartment is new and air conditioned.",positive
"Very nice breakfast.  The staff was WONDERFUL.  We were celebrating our anniversary and when we arrived they had decorated our room with some balloons and hearts and left us a gift as well.  The view of the steeples in the square was lovely.  All of this extra attention was well appreciated and if we ever return to Ghent, we will certainly return to this Ibis hotel.  Strongly recommend it!  And the location couldn’t have been better.",positive

Everything was what we wanted for our vacation.",positive
"The hotel restaurant is expensive, not open every day and not vegetarian friendly. Water or coffee in your room would have been nice. We needed a kettle for the baby to sterelise her bottles but they were not able to provide one. In the bathroom there was no cold water..running the cold tap for ages still provided luke warm or boiling hot water. Not great if you’re breastfeeding and needing to keep hydrated or just to brush your teeth.,

Beautiful location, beautiful old building and surrounding nature.",negative

The staff was helpful and nice, always willing to lend a hand to answer questions or help with directions.The room had a great view of the cathedral and square; it was tidied up daily.",positive
"The hotel is fine for 1-2 day stay, but if you are carrying more clothes there was no place (cupboard) to hang them.,

Perfect location and super easy and flexible check-in / check-out!,positive

Close to center of Durbuy but quiet neighbourhood. Comfortable rooms. Terrace with little garden.",positive

I can only confirm the other reviews. The room was perfect, bathroom was perfect clean and all modern requirements available. The room was very beautiful and Angélique was a great and accessible host.
Price - quality probably (one of) the best in the region",positive
"Our room was perfect for us. Simple and adequate for our 2 day stay and very clean. The bedding is minimal, no unnecessary pillows and covers if you know what i mean. The staff are wonderful, we arrived much earlier than check in time and this was not an issue. At one point we requested and iron and they sent it to the wrong room, although this was not an issue for us, they apologized with a hand written note and some wonderful treats. My husband and I were humbled by this, you usually do not get this type of customer service in most hotels and we travel a lot. I would definitely stay here again.

"Only two small things to improve: - add a door to the master bedroom, so that parents can get some privacy. Right now only the kids bedroom has a door.- add an umbrela outside for the garden. The property has an amazing garden, with a great view, will be even nicer to enjoy with an umbrela for shade,

The house is in a great location, just a couple minutes walk from the Durbuy center. The kitchen is well equipped, so especially recommended for families that want to cook during their stay. Overall a great experience.",positive
"This is a repurposed garage, kind of small, uncomfortable to move around and with no space to put your stuff. ,

The host was very kind and helpful, gave excellent advice on where to go and what to see. The room and the bathroom look modern and new and have everything you need.

We loved our room .... Was beyond our expectations, the view was excellent. The green and everything. Our overall stay was excellent. I would recommend this accomodation.",positive
"In the comment below you can read that the owner claims we have stolen things and that we made a lot of noise. This is not true. After arriving home from our trip the owner claimed that we had damaged things in the house and he asked for 500 euros. We immediately called him to settle this because we didn't do anything, but he didn't take the calls. We didn't hear from him afterwards. We hope you don't book an apartment with this man, because it is not okay at all to try and claim money from your customers. I have been a loyal client from booking and never had any problems before. This claim has ruined our trip. We will never book here again.Booking has now deleted this apartment from the website. However, pay attention because the owner is also active on other websites.",negative

The location was excellent it was so close to the city and Phillipe was very helpful and nothing was too much for him, we were able to leave our luggage on checkout day so that was a big bonus not to have to carry it around all day as we had an evening flight. Would definitely stay there again.",positive

Great location",positive
"We stayed in a family room. The sofa bed was ok only for young kids, very narrow and too thin matress.The toilet equipped with WC and sink, without mirror, was really bad smelling, impossible to use it.On Sunday, for a long time there were no scrumbled eggs for breakfast, one of the coffee machine was out of order, lumpy waffles.",negative

Everything was decently clean in the room but hallways and reception could be improved.",negative
"This was the last room available near to the Menin Gate that accepted dogs. We would have stayed in the same hotel as my son and family but, unfortunately, they didn't accept pets. Our room was clearly meant for family occupation, having two singles and two bunk beds squashed into a dark and dingy room with a view of a partition wall right outside the window. The bathroom was horrible. The door didn't close fully, the lock had been vandalised and there were other signs of damage in the room. My son and family had breakfast with us on one morning and were charged E20 each although there was no charge for the children.  To be fair - we did glimpse (longingly) the rooms at the front of the hotel which overlooked the Grote Market square and they seemed a lot brighter and more acceptable.     We wouldn't stay again however.,

The proximity to the Menin Gate - we were visiting to lay a wreath for my grandfather who was killed at Passchendaele.   Breakfast wasn't bad and was inclusive.     Cleaning staff were friendly.",negative

It was impossible to get rid of the smell even when the restaurant was closed and our window open. It was a shame as the hotel otherwise was excellent.

I kept it outside one day and most of the watch splash in the bathroom making whole floor wet. 2. There is a sign / notice about multiple use of towel in a bathroom and i wanted to use it next time so i followed the instruction but it seems the hotel management does not care about the environment. 3.

Ideal situation on the Square close to Cloth Hall Flanders Fields Museum and short walk to Menen  Gate.Close to a good selection of bars, restaurants  coffee bars and souvenir shops.Would make and ideal base for a couple of days if touring the battle field sites in the area.The Town of Ypres has a really good vibe,",negative

Nice atmosphere, Nice staff, good service",positive

the rooms are very clean and the staff very kind and supportive. not to mention the perfect location to the city center and the metero station. it highly recommended",positive
"We were there over a weekend, so we had to park our car a distance from the hotel, but it was free so that was a big plus.  When we arrived and left, there was parking close by, so loading and unloading the car was no problem.,

Location was great, right in the middle of everything.  The breakfast buffet was one of the best we have ever had anywhere.  Wonderful selection of food to choose from.",positive
"Had a ground floor room was a bit noisy on occasions. ,

Within walking distance to all the tourist attractions. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.",positive

The location is excellent. The bed was comfortable.",negative
"I didnt like the fact that I could exactly hear what my neighbour said during calling her mother. I was able to understand every single word. This disturbed my sleep and this is something what made me feel uncomfortable, to know my neighbour also does hear what I say during calling someone. you hear every step on the aile while being inside. this is a pitty.,

The Location is great and I liked the style of interior design, Looks really fancy. Also the bar was well equipped.",positive
"Parking was not very easy. Garage only and then a 300 yard walk to property.,

The location was great — the entrance was in the middle of a mall — but the inside of the place was great.",positive

Nice staff and clean room. Saturday morning  there is a market with various thinks around the hotel.,positive
"Misleading pictures on the site about how the rooms are... i paid for a superior room but at the check in i got a another room different from the picture, and the crazy and vague explanation from the staff was that the picture was a presentation of the best room and the rooms on the pictures were all reserved, so what i got was still a good room but very different from the picture. That was a shame!! ,

Location perfection !",negative
"Windows could not open to change the air in the room.,

Very silent despite proximity to highway.  Good restaurant inside the hotel",positive
"The first night we got an old room, while by the booking new pictures were being showed. Asked for a new room which was much more comfortable.
Due to the reconstruction of the rooms we got woken at 7am caused by drilling and bricking. Got a poor night sleep. Would have booked another hotel if i’de noticed in advance. 
Breakfast is expensive and better elsewhere.,

The new rooms are nice
Location is perfect",negative
"Sinks are very small, even in suites.Wardrobe is ""non conventional""It is sometime expensive, but not this time.Rest is quite nice really.,

The TV and entertainment setup, the HDMI port etc even in the smallest rooms.Breakfast is ok but expensive.Beds are quite comfortable.Fridge.The bar and the ambience at the lounge/reception.",positive
"Not a dislike but just a lil bit of hassle using the lift, only 2-3pax per time. Not bcos we can't squeeze in, it's bcos of the sensor at the door. The lift will stopped automatically if anything touches the sensor. Then you have to manually turn a knob to restart it. Otherwise nothing else.,

Everything about the apartment facilities & the location. Right smack in the middle of city ctr. Walking distance to practically everywhere for shopping and eating. A lil bit noisy frm the pubs below late at night bt we were fine with it. Kitchen utensils were sufficient bt didn't get a chance to use it (delicious food everywhere!!) Halal indian restaurant right downstrs serving one of the best Briyani I've ever tasted (we went back twice for dinner). Waffles waffles everywhere!! Chocolates chocolates all over the places!! We would definitely want to visit Belgium again and would definitely stay here again if we come to Brussels.",positive
"Small room, building under construction.  Breakfast is the best thing about this hotel, there were so many viriaties of nuts, raisons, freshly squeezed orange juice and much more, however there seems to be a problem with fruit flies, they were everywhere in the buffet area, even on food.  I think this issue should be taken seriously as its very unhygienic.  Hotel is clean.
We found it hard to move around in the room, due to its size.  It lacks lighting, no light above the mirror in the room. 
We stayed there one night and moved to another hotel near the station as we were leaving early, the other hotel was much cheaper but room was bigger, well lit and beautiful.  So very disappointed to have paid so much money for thon hotel.

Breakfast",negative
"The location couldn't have been better. My room was perfect for a solo traveller, the bed was very comfortable and having tea/coffee making facilities in the room was an added bonus. The breakfast provided downstairs was very good with lots of variety.",positive
"The tourist tax was excluded from the hotel fee, which worked out to be 6 Euro. Sure this is maybe not a lot but I hate it when unexpected charges come into play (Hidden fees). The hotel fee must be a total fee for a default night stay.,

The AC worked amazingly and has a little garden with tables and chairs, which worked wonderfully if you do not want to sit in the room the whole day when it is too hot to do site seeing.",positive
"There is nothing we didn’t like. ,

Brilliant hotel in a great location just behind the cathedral. We were lucky to get a room with a balcony that overlooked the city centre. Room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. 
Staff were friendly and knowledgeable and advised us where to visit. 
I would definitely use the hotel again.",positive
"Fantastic location, very helpful staff.",positive
"We have booked a twin room, but on arrival we have received a twin room but the beds where put together and only one sheet was placed on both of them. We couldn't separate it completely to feel comfy. I have pointed out that there will be 2 male colleagues travelling, but probably they didn't take this into consideration. Very expensive breakfast. Room was tiny.,

During the short overnight stay we couldn't explore a lot, but hotel is in a very nice location, old building with views and well established gardens. A lot of parking spaces available.",positive

Great location with plenty shops, cafe's bars & restaurants all within a short walk, nice friendly staff, good selection of drinks at the bar, enjoyable continental style breakfast with a good choice on offer.",positive
"Parking area was a slight walk away in exchange for a nice clear chateau grounds. And some effort is required to bring luggage up & down narrow stairs leading to room, especially in the smaller building. Just pointing out small inconveniences that dont really spoil the wonderful stay there. ,

Amazing views and quiet surroundings.
Lounge area was tastefully decorated. Casual and homely yet private and luxurious. Staff at lobby were efficient and cheerful. Rooms were also better than expectations. The rates during my stay in October were irresistable. A no brainer decision compared to others in the area.",positive
"Building/Facility is a bit old. I traveled a lot and stayed at many different hotels but i don't think I ever wanna come back for this hotel. At least not for the full price. And it is very hard to find the hotel parking as some of  the roads near the hotel are closed for construction.,

Price. I was alone for 1 night and the (single) room rate was really cheap. Bath room was very modern and clean,",negative
The room was too small though it was said to be a superior,negative
The only complaint about my stay was how loud the area is at night. It was very loud even from the 5th floor. Other than that the place was great.,positive
"Close to several great dining, shopping and entertainment venues, this apartment was neat and clean- not to mention the genuinely kind and friendly host!",positive
"The bathroom was not entirely clean,the soap missing. Similar for the hotel corridors. The hotel was under scaffolding. The bathroom furniture and equipment old.,

Complimentary water,tee and coffee.The staff was polite.",negative
"Room was very small and hardly space to walk around. There was no room for bedside tables. En-suite was also very pokey and dated. Walls were white painted and very grubby. Due to the central location it was a bit noisy at night but only to be expected when staying in the middle of town. Parking was not provided and I had to leave an expensive motorcycle outside in the street. Thankfully it was still there in the morning and undamaged. ,

Location was perfect right on the square. It's a two minute walk to the Menin Gate. Breakfast was plentiful and excellent. The restaurant where breakfast is served was clean and modern as were the communal areas of the hotel. There was also a lift which was handy.",negative

"The beams of the ceiling in room 212 were too low (at 1.60 m) so that we had to bend over to walk around inthe room. Comparing to another family room this one was not 'value for money'.,

Nice breakfast with homemade jams and local products.  Big domain with lots of free games ( mini golf, kubbing, snooker, tennis,...). The fire and comfy sofas in the guest area are so unique in this historical castle.",positive

Beautiful lobby and great atmosphere. Rooms have had a renewal since rebranded from mercure.",positive
"A little problem în The bathroom. The room must have a better ventilation! There are some problems with mold, not serious, but not in very long time if you do not find a better ventilation solution they will appear soon,

The apartment is clean and with good facilities. The apartment has the best placement for a holiday in Brussels. Close to everything you need for an excellent vacation.",positive
"Our room was located next to a building where heavy construction is taking place. Luckily for us they don’t work during the weekend, but it is not appropriate that the staff didn’t inform us about that before. Also, the receptionists come off quite cold and we didn’t feel very welcome. For the price that we paid, our stay didn’t feel worth it. Lastly, the bathrooms are quite outdated.,

The room was clean.",negative

I had to change my room 4 am in the morning and had to wake up my 10 yr old daughter in the middle of the night.Next day the receptionist with blonde hair (Middle aged lady) was grumpy and unfriendly - she was probably racist from what i made out.  Location is far out of centre of Brussels and you have to drive 5km to get to Ramada car park of this hotel.,

Not everyone able to have shower at the same time as it takes up to 2 hours for the water to clear. We didn’t want the water to overflow the shower room so sometimes we had to skip shower session.,

Location is really good and the host provided a lot of useful information prior to arrival. Check in and check out process is easy. Host allowed early check in which was really appreciative since I was travelling with senior citizens and small baby.",positive

"The check in was very unpleasant.   The staff was really rude and did not understand guess who arrived having travelled 6hrs in the car and to be told must wait another 45 mins to check in and to have wifi password.   This is a Ramada.   Service should be better than this.      Unsatisfied with the old lady who did the check in.,

Hotel is very nice and clean.",positive
"The waitress in the bar was very stressed and always in a hurry, even though it was not that crowded. When I asked what exists inside a cocktail that was written in the menu, she freaked out, telling me that she didn't know the ingredients and that she hadn't made it before - so I ordered a wine :),

We were two couples and we had requested the rooms to be close. I was so amazing the fact that the two rooms were connected through an internal door! I loved it, it was so fun! The view in the rooms was great, we were seeing the cathedral!The breakfast was amazing, and the staff at the reception very kind and friendly.",positive

Reasonable price and comfortable.",positive
"When you’re staying in the new building, you might as well be staying in any new hotel. There was, however, no airconditioning in the rooms, and we happened to be there on a very hot day. Little things are missing, like a towel hook by the basin in the room. Also just a heads up that it’s a quite a walk from the parking to the rooms. The biggest problem, however, was one of understaffing. The receptionist was friendly, but clearly overworked. Besides her, the only other person around was the bar lady, whose first day it was. She had clearly not received sufficient training and could not cope with the pressure.  There was no manager around to assist or to deal with guest complaints. There is no service on the terrace (which is a nice place to sit) so you have to queue at the bar and hope for the best. Importantly, the blame is not to be placed on the inexperienced bar lady but on management.,

The setting (the hotel is in a park) is lovely and peaceful. The rooms (in the new building) were recently built and clean.",positive
"The airco was better but also a bit noisy in the second room, and could not be set to a comfortable temperature / fan level, and I had to be switch it off during the night so I could sleep (and this was during the record heat wave in late July). Also the pillows were not great (one was too thin and two were too thick).,

The location is not central, but it was ok for me. The staff was helpful and agreed to change my room, as the one they gave me first had a noisy airco unit.",positive

Horrible. Lifts are working really bad, noisiy and doors work badly. Breakfast is too expensive fo its quality and variety. Hotel is too expensibe for the contort/money value. Relly dificult to adjust the water temperature in the shower (this happened another time -Really hot and not possible to get cold water to compensate). No welcome drinkable water (please, this is nothing and means a lot for the traveler after long fligh/jouuney). Hospitality is not perceived at all.

"The hotel needed some renovation: hair dryer not working, door handle damaged.Price-quality wise, the price was definitely on the high end for what you get in return: we were there in low season for a midweek stay and we still had to pay 85 EUR/night without breakfast while the hotel was deserted.,

The hotel is located on the main square with all other hotels inside the city centre.There is the possibility for €50 per person to access the wellness centre in a partner hotel, which comes with a pool, sauna & hammam.Friendly staff.",negative

Great location, rooms are big and quiet.",negative
"On arrival it was difficult to find the entrance/reception area. Had to ask a bartender. Would be better if there was a sign. Also, information about parking could be more specific in the booking criteria as the cost wasn’t clear. 
No lift to the 3rd floor. This should be included in the info as my partner with sciatica had difficulty getting to the room and back. In fact it was difficult for me too, given the staircase is steep and narrow. ,

The hotel is situated in the area right next to the main train station. Plenty of parking available (underground city parking), but quite expensive if you were to stay a few days (€2 per hour). 
Hôtel is nice, with very comfortable bed and good quality duvet. Place is clean. 
Breakfast was good, with plenty of options.
Staff nice and helpful.",negative

"When we arrived at the hotel, at around 6 p.m., we didn't find anyone welcoming us at the reception: there were only different keys on the table for different guests (to be honest, anyone could have entered the hotel and picked them up from the table because there was literally no one...). In fact, we picked up our key and at first we stepped on the wrong strairs, so we had to go search for our room (it would have been useful to know this information from the receptionist).When we entered the room and the bathroom, we could tell that they were clean: too bad that when we opened the toilet lid, there was some toilet paper in the WC (maybe it was a mistake, but it was disgusting to see it).The worst thing was that, after taking a shower, a smell of sewer came out of the shower (we did not feel at ease after this).The next morning my boyfriend kindly explained in French to the owners of the hotel (a young guy and a man) that we found strange not seeing anyone at the check-in, and they answered that it was our mistake because we said that we would have come in the morning (the check-in time is between 3-9 p.m., as shown on booking.com, so we thought it wouldn't have been a problem); anyway, the young guy was very nice with us and apologised, while the older one was not.We also kindly asked if it was possible to leave them the luggage for some time before leaving, and they said yes and that they would have been around all day, but when we came back to pick up the luggage no one was there.,

The hotel is in a very good position, it's exactly in the main square of Durbuy. The view is also very good, we could see the castle from our window. The room and the bathroom were clean and the breakfast was good, my boyfriend and I spent Easter in this hotel and we found different types of Easter eggs in the tray. It was very lovely!",negative

Not one had any food except bread rolls. I walked through the 2 rooms twice and still saw no staff - no where! So I left. Receptionist doesn’t even look at you or stand up when you ask a question at the desk! Shocking!Shower door stupidly positioned - no place to put soap or shampoo in shower. No plugs near the bed. Tv takes up almost the entire desk. Some of the coach loads of tourists were very noisy in the halls.,

Rooms were enormous. Widows very good and blocked street noise. The gentleman host at breakfast was very good.",negative

Gorgeous property to get away from everything. Beautiful view from our room.  Large rooms with high ceilings. Small but adequate bathroom. Outlet by bed for charging cell phone.

Make sure you book a parking space in advance, fills up fast, we had to park on the street and walk in the rain 5min
Was extremely hot inside, there is no way to regulate the temperature in the room, we kept the window open even tho outside was 2°C
For all this, we paid 145€ per night.... wayyyy too expensive, shouldn't be more than 50€
Will not recommend it ,

"The room stank of sewage upon arrival. Nevertheless, I slept in, and informed reception staff in the morning. Nothing was done, and when I came back the room was as I left it - stinky. I traced the reason to a filthy shower curtain, that I showered for some time with the shower hand held telephone, and guess what, bad smell went magically away. I informed the lady at the reception before leaving, and she was very sorry, but her male colleague did nothing about it when he had to. Totally unacceptable attitude from the reception, and it's not the first time - a annoying episode happened one year ago. This was my third visit to the Ramada Woluve and it's going to be the last.,

Good breakfast. Staff at breakfast.",negative
"This property was very nice however the staff were not the most pleasant. One new bartender was very nice however and so was the check in desk guy. Other than that they basically ignored me when I had questions for them. Also no ac at this hotel. But that’s not their fault it’s part of the experience.

Motel One’s are the same wherever you go. Same room layout and decor. It’s clean and comfortable and I rarely have any complaints. This is the 2nd time I have stayed at the Brussels one and again the stay was a solid 7/10. The rooms are fairly basic, but aside from no fridge, it’s perfectly fine. The location is good - 10 min walk from Central Station / 15-20 min walk to Grote Markt. Staff are cordial and i’d happily stay again.",positive

Couldn't muster a smile.... Although the room was clean the  carpet had big stains....the toilet cistern flusher button was missing....please show TRUE pictures that actually show the true state of your accomodation so people can make an informed choice ,

Man at reception checking us out was kindof  apologetic and ordered us a taxi",negative

Carpet in the dining room was filthy.We asked specifically for a room that we could access without stairs, but the first room offered not only had access via stairs but had no handrail. After some hassle, the room was changed.,

"No one on reception when we arrived but the brasserie staff helped us. Some travellers might find it annoying having to go for breakfast at another hotel but that is reflected in the price of the rooms compared to the main hotel. English is not spoken particularly in the area, so be aware for menus in restaurants and have a translation book or app available if you are not fluent in French/Dutch/German.,

Hotel Cote Coeur appears to be a sister hotel of one down the road and is basically two floors above two shops and a brasserie - breakfast is in the other hotel down the road as are any wellness facilities.  The room we stayed in was very comfortable, modern and clean. It is a lot cheaper than the main hotel so we would say it is value for money and worth the little walk for breakfast. It is also right among the restaurants and shops in Durbuy. We enjoyed our stay.",positive

I asked hotel to call a taxi,  theirs took 15 minutes to reach and finally 41 euros yo charge. Between city and this place, using public transport meant too many changes or too much walking ,

"We stayed at the Pentahotel Leuven to visit the „Rock Werchter Festival“. It‘s located in the very Centre of Leuven,having lots of Bars/Restaurants and little shops. To get to the main train station (where the shuttle for Werchter departs),you have to take a 15 minutes walk.The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself has everything you need and is very clean. Breakfast wasn‘t presented as a huge buffet,but included everything you need,from eggs to ham/cheese,fruits and vegetables,bread and sweets,...If we think of visiting Werchter again next year,this will definetly be the place to stay.",positive

"If paying the full price for breakfast it's very expensive compared to other hotels we've stayed in so we've often had breakfast in town for much less. It's good that there's a restaurant in the hotel (we were tired after a long drive and didn't fancy going out) but unfortunately the food we had suffered from spending too long in the microwave.,

We have often used this hotel when visiting Brussels because it's in an excellent location for getting into the city centre and because it has good parking facilities. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff friendly and welcoming.",positive

"The room was EXTRIMELY small.
I was told my room would not have been cleaned due to Covid-19 restrictions. To get a clean room, I would have had to change the room and I could do that as many times as I wanted. This also applies to towels and toilet paper. However, after three days I asked to change my room and then they just sent the cleaning service. It seems only a cheap excuse not to clean the room. Moreover, the breakfast buffet could be considered way more dangerous, since people are touching food and stuff.,

Amazing position",negative

"Room is very small and carpet is old and smelly, bathroom and shower cabin are even smaller. The room should have been quite silent, but there was some kind of equipment buzzing through the night. Sounded like a fridge, but it was not the one in the room. Could not really sleep because of that.,

"Could have a green wall on one of the patio walls. As there is a lack of trees and landscape in the city that would bring kind of calmness into the garden of patio hotel.,

Good location. Great interior design. So far the best 3 star hotel I ever visited. Could be 4 star hotel. Good breakfast. I would consider to stay in one of this chain hotels in other cities when traveling. Good hotel for a short city break or business travel.",positive

The breakfast was lovely and the hotel went out if their way to do it earlier than they would normally have done as we had to be up early! They coped very well with the restrictions in place because of the virus regulations! Their breakfast produce was very fresh and delicious! Very well presented!",positive

"The rooms with a view are awesome but a bit noisy. Even during a non-busy time, we heard street noise. The parking situation is also not ideal-there is limited street parking or a garage about 300M away.,

Because of Covid, breakfast was delivered to the room and it was excellent. Staff added some extra ""freebies"" for my little girls and they loved it. Hotel is beautiful and family room was plenty big enough for family of four. Lovely bathroom and amenities.",positive

"Room was a bit small, especially the shower cabin. Price of the room a bit too steep for what it was but possibly that was because we visited during a public holiday weekend.,

Very friendly staff, a warm welcome in this pleasant family hotel. Location is great, just off the beach. Super clean room with a comfortable bed and a good buffet breakfast with fresh local products - bakeries, cheese. Well suited for staying with small children (and dogs, if interested). Good wifi connection.",positive
"The breakfast, while a good value at 11.50 euros, I found to be not that great. The automated espresso machines serve very bad coffee :( the gluten free options for bread - while very much appreciated - were dry, packaged cardboard-tasting products.,

I read rave reviews about this hotel - but it is just a slightly above average hotel with a very nice staff. A bed, a bathroom, pretty comfortable, but no extra amenities in my small room. Comfortable bed, but made of some kind of memory foam, so it was too hot and I couldn't sleep well. Good air circulation / AC.",positive

The location of the hotel is superb; it's just behind the belfry tower, and every attraction is within walking distance.

"carpeting in room stained should be changed,

breakfast exceptional",negative
"No iron in rooms they only have one iron on the 4th floor which was a nightmare. No wardrobes but than again I guess that’s why it’s a motel and not a “hotel”... ,

Staff were amazing such friendly people. Helpful and the hotel itself is within walking distance to most tourist attractions. Very central.",positive
"The rooms really need tea and coffee making facilities. There’s no staff on duty after 23.00 and the front door and reception are closed, so you come in through a side door with a code. The work we were doing involved late finishes, and while it wasn’t too much of an issue not to be able to get a drink at the bar at that time, we could ALL have done with a hot drink...it was a freezing cold night, too. A definite entry in the “ debit” column .....,

The rooms were comfortable, with very nice bathrooms, and the breakfast was very good.",positive

Great staff! Very helpful and friendly! Great atmosphere throughout my stay! 😀",positive

Kindly include kettle heaters to boil water because I had to go everyday requesting the bar staff to give me hot water.",positive
"15-minute walk to the nearest tram stop (but once you're there, it's an easy ride to the city centre). On Booking.com it's described as being in Ghent, but it's actually in Melle. (If you put in the street address with ""Ghent"" into your car navigation system, you'll end up in the wrong place, further down the same road.) The stairs to the upstairs rooms are very narrow and very steep, so not recommended for people with mobility problems.,

Beautiful old-style house with very atmospheric breakfast room and calm countryside views. Just outside of Ghent (in Melle), but only a few kilometres away from the city centre, which is easy to each by tram. Very friendly staff and decent breakfast quality. We had one of the ""family rooms"" upstairs, which was very large and offered two separate sleeping areas with two single beds each. Free parking space on premises, so good for people who are travelling by car.",positive
Very clean and comfortable.,positive
Just well done,positive
"In the evening of the first day there was no hot water. I booked this hotel 3 weeks before my work trip and paid 204 euros per night, so i expected more than just cold water. Last year i also stayed in 2 stars hotel, payed less money, but everthing was perfect. ,

"very basic room. would benefit from some refreshing. At arrival noone was present at the reception ""fone for 5 minutes"" which took probably 15 minutes. When someone finally arrived, they started chatting with other customers asking for drinks. not a very nice customer experience. Water from the shower is ""boiling hot"".

Nice and spacious room, very well located with all the amenities.
Nice and welcoming staff. 
All the covid protocols made it a safe place to stay.",positive
"Room 508 is a fantastic junior suite with one external but still major issue: a bar about 10m below its window, highly popular and frequented at least in the early months of the university year by students who are definitively enjoying their time and letting you know about it until late or early morning hours. Barely slept more than 3 hours on both nights. Hard to fix unless a worthy investment in far better sound proofing on the roof windows.,

Design, services, breakfast buffet, WiFi quality, junior suite spacious",positive
The property has not been refurbished in a long long time. The curtains were completely ripped and in general it did not feel safe.,negative
"The hotel was nice and quiet, the host was very helpful with giving us information on the area like best areas to eat. Would stay there again.",positive

Staff very helpful perfect located.",negative
"Entertainment channels were very limited. 
Night lamp was very bright so I could not leave it on during night. It's not good when small children are living in the room. They may scare in the dark room in the night. I did not see any techniques to reduce lamp brightness. If there is any provision to do it, please ignore my comments. ,

Reception gave me warm welcome. Staff was friendly, polite and really helpful. Room service was excellent. Hotel staff was following COVID-19 rules. Room was spacious, neat and clean.

It was clean and the receptionist was nice.",negative
"At the time of my visit, there was major work being done right outside the hotel, which created both noise and a not-so-pleasant environment, especially when it rained. Also, on what turned out to be the first day back to school and University, the partying right in the neighbourhood was loud at night. Thankfully, the double windows were effective.,

I liked the location right in the midst of old town - that was the best! Also the room and bed were comfortable and clean.",positive

Everything is great!,positive
"There was no towel in my bathroom. I was woken up at midnight by two German men talking and smoking on the patio below. Shutting the window did not help much and it was very warm so I kept the window open and told them I couldn't sleep. This worked. I woke at 5.40am as there was a delivery to the hotel on Sunday morning. The hotel is on a main road and near a main train line so is a bit noisy in the attic room. Worst thing, not the hotel's problem is finding it as it is in Melle, not Gent and the receptionist told me many visitors had struggled to find it. Apparently, booking.com show it as Gent, when it is in Melle. Suggest you put a note on the webpage ""Put Melle into the satnav"",

The breakfast was very good with friendly staff. The location is good for an easy stop on the way across Europe.",positive

"Due to COVID, the rooms are not cleaned during your stay which becomes a problem if you stay more than a couple of days because you cannot also clean it yourself (e.g., no brushes available, even for the toilet!).Although the room was very spacious, it was not organized in a smart way: there was a lot of free space near the entrance door but no hooks for clothes or shelves for shoes or bags. You'll have to drag your outerwear into the middle of the room together with your sandy clothes and bags from the beach. Or just leave them in a pile next to the door.Also only 2 hooks in the bathroom. No shelves in the shower at all!No sockets close to the bedAll this is in no case horrible but it's just sad that such a nice space was not properly organized with just a bit of thinking.,

Quite nice location of the hotel (approximately 10-15 min to the beach). The room was very spacious with a big comfortable bed. Big shower. Air-Conditioning.",negative

The hotel is very well located. It is walking distance to the heart of the city and the ocean/the beach.

Good selection of beers in small bar.  We were in new part at back of hotel – quiet and spacious room. Good choice of food at breakfast. Short drive (15 minute walk) to tram stop into town (3 Euros each way). Lots of parking on road hotel side of tram stop before traffic lights.

The location is one of the best in the city, just some meters from the Markt square.

"Only fault with the Ibis was no tea or coffee making facility in the room... Whist it wasn't advertised as having this, it would have been a welcome addition rather that having to go down to reception to grab a cuppa, especially first thing in the morning... a tea and a coffee at  7 Euro a pop was a tad costly!,

Great location and very quiet.... Very useful underground car park at extra cost but worth paying for a secure space.",positive

"The restaurant has superb service, brilliant wines and high quality food. But not enough vegetarian choices on the menu. (They were very happy to do a risotto and suggest other things they could make for me, but could add a couple of choices on the menu as well to really enhance the restaurant).,

Excellent hotel, I've been a couple of times now. The room this time was huge, comfortable bed and luxurious bedroom. Breakfast seems small but there are actually plenty of choices and healthy ones at that.",positive

"I booked this room last minute (30 min before we arrived). The host did not speak any English but he was so welcoming and gracious. When we had trouble finding the way down to the boat, he got in his car and drove us to show us. The boat is roomy with a large comfortable common area living room, kitchen and dining area. There are four rooms on the boat, each with private bathrooms. The two rooms in the front have an amazing river view. Above there is a nice deck with tables and chairs, lounge chairs and a hot tub. The city center is a 5 min walk. Lots of shopping, restaurants and a grocery store. The included breakfast was wonderful. Fresh bread, homemade jams, cold cuts and cheeses. I would love to stay there again.",positive
"Located At the center. 
At the front dest Mr. Axel was very professional, willing to help and full of energy. Thanx for everything",positive
"When we turned up, room was not ready. Ended up getting keys 2 hours late. No apology  was just told their staff didn’t up. They let us put our luggage in luggage room, but it wasn’t locked or supervised - so we were apprehensive. 
Electrics in bathroom were appalling. An accident waiting to happen. I had to keep warning my children not to touch any plugs in bathroom. This would be illegal in the UK even in a private home, never mind in a hotel ! 
Shame because this place is great for location so has so much more potential. Building needs some moderate investment to bring the safety standards up to acceptable levels. 
But having said that, if I ever visited Bruges again, I would seriously reconsider it - purely for location and reasonable price.

30sec from main Market square. Reasonable price for central location.",negative
"I couldn't find enough plug points in the room,

An excellent location only 5 minutes walk from the train station, and 7-8 minutes to the town centre. Room was comfortable, spacious and well lit.

Nice clean room.Nice breakfast,positive
"We dined in the hotel's gastronomic restaurant, and we both found the menu to be highly confusing. The choices available for the set menus were unclear and we had a hard time figuring out which dishes were starters and which were mains. The staff tried to help but didn't do a good job of explaining - in part because of the language barrier (my French is rather rusty). The food was decent enough, but we would have enjoyed the experience more if we'd better understood the choices available.,

This is a small, family run hotel in a lovely house on the hill above the town. It boasts a fabulous view across the river valley to the medieval castle. While we didn't spring for the balcony rooms we really enjoyed the terrace overlooking the town, where you can relax and enjoy a beer and the beautiful view. Breakfast in the grand dining room was both excellent and good value. The location is handy for visiting the town on foot.",positive

Super standard NH hotel in the centre of Brussels. Everything simply perfect. Don't expect personality in these hotels, just everything perfect.",positive

"the weather, but not their fault :),

breakfast is fantastic, one of the best in a 4 star hotel I can remember.",positive
"As a small critic point, maybe one or two drinks (even just water) could have been included in the mini bar, within the room. Also a discount on the parking lot if possible, for people that have visited the hotel. ,

The employees were always helpful and could be contacted 24/7. Place of the hotel is also very handy, between both water and the busy shopping street. The parking lot was quite pricey, but on the other hand it was handy having direct access to it. Overall definitely a great visit and I can only recommend it.",positive
"The location is spot on, close to all the nice bars and restaurants
The building is a very old place amazingly well refurbished by keeping its authenticity.",positive

Really nice płace, I stayed in many different hotels in this area and this is one of the best! Really nice staff, clean room, nice bathroom. The food in the restaurant is great. Similarly breakfast is very good.",positive
"The restaurant is supposed to be very good but was not open so we never got to experience it, which was a shame. A lamp was not working over where the luggage stand was, making it hard to rummage in the dark.Wi-Fi was not working, despite showing full signal.  Mentioned it to the owners who asked us to double-check things were plugged in (they were) and yet it was never solved as they never followed up and we were only there for one night so did not have the energy to make a big thing of it.  We lived with it but is inconvenient if you wish to watch something being streamed or call family abroad which can be very data-heavy pastimes.A bit short on towels for 5 people, but I'm sure they'd have brought us more if we had asked.,

The place is family run and there is a good attention to detail, especially for families.  They have three kids so know what it is like trying to find a room for everyone to fit comfortably, that is not extortionate.  Our room was lovely and spacious and they had arranged for the kids to sleep upstairs and for us adults below.  The bathroom was very clean and well lit. Apparently built 10 years ago but it looks brand new.  The furnishings were warm and neutral, a bit like a chalet in the country: Lots of raw wood and French carved lamp stands and exposed beams.  We had a balcony / terrace backing on to a wooded area which was nice.  It felt as if we were in a treehouse.",positive
The hotel is in a very nice area of Brussels . Few minutes away from the central station and the Centre. Staff are extremely helpful and go out of their way to guide you . Breakfast is also very good with a great  variety to choose from . Will surely use this hotel again if I visit Brussels . Highly recommended.,positive

"The “ all you can eat “ breakfast was a real disappointment after reading the reviews. Mainly continental, the English breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs that had been sat in the pot for a while, the bacon was partly burnt and yet Luke warm and the sausages were cocktail type and again lukewarm, the American breakfast ie waffles or pancakes weren’t available as the machine was broken,  all for the bargain price of €15 a head.Only saw 1 member of staff on at any one time, so if that guy had to do everything no wonder breakfast was not as advertised. Sorry Ibis but you really dropped the ball on this occasion. AND €2.50 for a Twix or Snickers ? Not big sellers then !!,

Very clean, strong and unusual smells on the landing, but sorted well within the 15 minute promise.A pleasant walk to the sea front, plenty of boutique type shops, Lidl’s close for those not fancying hotel food prices.",negative

Hotel at excellent location in Bouillon, at walking distance from centre ville. The hotel/restaurant is situated on a hill and has a fabulous garden with evening sun overlooking the city and its castle: a true gem after a long drive.Nice restaurant with a good collection of wines and attentive staff.",positive

"Read the small print about checking in and out. The checkout is until 10, check in has a narrow window. Want to check in after 19? Prepare to pay 10 to 20 euros extra. Sounds like a rip off to me, especially given that there is a code lock for the front door so the only thing the host needs to do if they are not at there is in fact send you instructions like in many other places. ,

Good value for money, impeccably clean and nice rooms.",positive

"The owner/chef Wim(?), ruined our time at this location.  He is a hot head with a chip on his shoulder that ended up being the downfall of our time there as well as two Americans also staying there that we befriended.  As John Paul, our Belgian American friend said ""this guy is really bad for Belgium.""  Not to prolong the misery but the incident arose after we were gifted by Van Steenberg Brewery near Ghent a magnum of our favorite Belgium beer, Tripel de Garre.  We told the staff we wanted to share it with others and the young son showed us we had a fridge in our room.  I then told Wim we met their guests from America and wanted to get some cheeses to offer them when we shared the bottle. Wim directed me to the store.  We met our friends on the public patio outside well away from the B&B and restaurant.  there was no one in the bar or restaurant.  I asked the young worker if we could use four glasses to share the beer and he graciously agreed.  After about 30 minutes of quietly enjoying the view and the beer, Wim stormed onto the public patio, told us we were not allowed to drink our belgium beer there and insisted we leave immediately.  We said OK and started to gather our belongings but Wim shouted ""right now, you must leave immediately!"" He then claimed in 20 years no guest has ever had the audacity to share a beverage on the public patio.  At that point, we had to ask him to calm down as he was acting threatening, but the rant continued.  He even told us about the size of his mortgage as if drinking our gift had deprived him of significant value!  The said thing is our simple celebration with new found friends is not what is depriving him of income.  It is the atrociously sophomoric culinary experience he offers.  It was also the low light of our eating in Belgium.  This guy really should not be in the service or culinary business.  To prove the point, aside from the four of us, only one other couple ever showed up for dinner.,

The place is up a steep hill but accessible if you've got stamina or a car.  The views, especially from our room #2 were dramatic of the city and the Count's Fort.  It had a lovely ""public patio"" (quotes to be explained later) and our room also had a grand outdoor patio.",negative

"The room was quite small and a bit hard to accommodate a big suitcase. I was not particularly happy with some of the staff at the reception, as I received a condescending attitude when my credit card did not work (basically being reprimanded for not putting the correct password, which was not the case). Also, cleaning could be improved, as, twice, the cleaning staff entered the room but did not clean the bathroom and did not replace the shampoo/shower gel.,

The location was excellent and main monuments were within very short walking distance. The breakfast was quite good and rich.",negative

"Signage and street signs were lacking and we had some difficulty locating the property.  Once we stopped at a local business for directions, we were able to find it.,

Our hostess was fantastic!  From the moment she carried our two heavy suitcases upstairs, to the instant connection we felt with her.  We enjoyed coffee on the patio in the evening and great conversation.  Breakfast was wonderful.  She could not do enough for us.  It was the first place we stayed where we shared hugs and tears the next morning when we left!  My only regret was that we did not catch her name.

"The hotel rooms condition is old and in some cases not well maintained. In our room both airco and shower were not functioning. As a result the room was so warm in the middle of winter (we were there end of January) that we couldn’t sleep even with the window hof open! The shower had no pressure at all and only cold water was coming through which made it super uncomfortable showering for ourselves but also dor our two little kids. Next morning we reported those issues and requested for another room. Pur request was accommodated and we got a room where everything was functioning good. So kudos to the receptionist hearing us out and actually doing something about it but Holiday Inn really needs to invest some money to renovate their hotel rooms. It’s about time as they are stuck back to ‘90s...old and very used with stains on the floor carpet and everything....,

I made an error with the check in time, I believed the check-in time was up to 9pm, thinking that most hosts prefer earlier than later, I turned up at 5.15pm and noticed that check-in time is between 18.00-21.00. Staphanie’s husband let me in and showed me to a very comfortable upper bed room and lounge, I was grateful and ready for a shower travelling by moto. Technically I could have been charged an additional fee, which was waived. In the evening I had a meal in Arlon; 7km, returned to the house for an excellent nights rest in a very comfortable bed. Breakfast was excellent, continental style, cheese, meats etc. and great coffee. Easy journey to the Channel ports, left at 9.30 I made good time for the return ferry and transferred to an earlier departure, arrived home while still light, mid-October. Southern Belgium is great moto country, I was in transit from SE Europe, next time I’ll stay longer, explore the area and fuel is cheap in nearby Luxembourg.",positive

"nice,

Its good and very near to my office",negative
"Only remark will be with regards to the parking, that limits the distance and time me as tourist can park and walk to the hotel. The big car park is 10m walking to the hotel, with luggage and rain is not very pleaseant,

Excellent location really easy to find. The Hotel staff was wonderful very helpful and concerned with the best way to please us. Swimming pool was open we were able to enjoy it but unfortunately the SPA closed due the actual COVID situation. Breakfast follow the same principle, the staff was always on top of us nothing missed. Was not a buffet again due the restrictions, but all we asked for was provided accordingly. We were impressed with the care of all.",positive
"Cleaning services could be better. Floor not clean enough, dust on furniture. Parking expensive and difficult to enter.,

Excellent location, spacious, nice place. Parking near by.",positive
"Could be cleaner.
Breakfast was limited, plates were often empty.
No fridge in the room, to have a cold drink you have to always go to the common space.,

Fly screens in windows, can sleep with open windows enjoying the silence and fresh air.
The hotel looks lovely from outside and has a beautiful garden.
Friendly stuff.",negative
"Far away from Namur downtown,

The crowd were really really friendly and helpful",negative
"Rooms too small, the pool is very cold (If you have a pool, don't you want your visitors to use it? After 20 minutes we had to leave because of the cold water).For sure I can tell that the room was not cleaned daily, only arranged the beds and changed the towels.Soap and Shampoo (Not separate) is located In a device near the sink and bathtub. I expect 4 star hotel to have a higher level Toiletries. This issue was not too important for us, I just mention it for the next guests.Air condition was a little noisy when you moved it from Fan level ""1"" to ""2"".Parking is 16 Euro per day and not under the hotel. 2 minutes walk so first you need to take your luggage and move it from the car to the lobby and, then, park your car.,

It is good hotel with very good breakfast and a indoor pool (Look also at the ""didn't like"") located at the center of Hasselt. The service is very good, reception staff helped us with any questions or requests even when we arrived late. Rooms are bit small but OK. Very quiet. Air conditioned.Price is fair.For 2-3 days of staying I would recommend this hotel.",positive
I love having a kettle in my room. The tea was actually not delicious but I had my own.,positive
"Nothing,

Everything",positive
"Accessing my room was a bit complicated and would not work for older folk.  Had expected a fridge in the room. Standing at the Loo doing a no 1. meant leaning to one side. The A/C had an irritating noise.,

The hotel is going through a refurbish i guess and the room I stayed in was brand new. It still had some minor niggles but overall was lovely with a big bed and a modern tv. The staff were friendly and there was lots CV19 pre-cautions. The design and furnishing is really cool. The room was large and well furnished with a massive bed and TV...",negative

"We got the worst room - something that almost always happens when we book on Booking.com,

Service was very kind and professional",positive
"The studio needs some rennovation. There was no handle on the door to the toilet, one glass was missed in the door to the bath. Window blinders felt off when I tried to adjust the height.,

The location is great.",negative
"The view, we looked at a wall ,

Nearby the city centre",positive
"The beds are indeed lacking in the support I need and want. The smell in the carpeted hallway is strong from previous smokers.,

The service was excellent. Breakfast simple but enough. Glad to have had our dog with us.",positive
Excellent value for its price. The landlord is very friendly and flexible. The studio is a very convenient place to stay.,positive
"rooms could do with a update. walls felt damp and sticky in our room
 room was more expensive than usual because of the festival.,

breakfast was excellent and staff were really friendly",positive
"Parking rather expensive when used only during the night. A concrete column in the middle of the room took a lot of space.,

Modern design if you like it. Room very calm and clean. Friendly staff. Spacious shower. Special balcony pool. Parking nearby.",positive
"The ramp for wheelchair access has been removed.  I used it, in the past, for my suitcase although there are just a few steps.,

This hotel is designed as a home away from home with it's large but cosy reception area that includes a bar.  The rooms are basic but functional.  The staff are friendly and I felt on this visit they have finally resolved the check-in process. The location of this hotel is great.",positive
"We booked a room with sauna and whirlpool which was written in our confirmation. Unfortunately the hotel confirmed a room only with sauna but we were able to change the room after talking to the receptionist. 
What we didn’t like was the service level at the reception- we had to wait till he finished 2 calls for more that 25 min (even if we were waiting already in front of the receptionist- he picked up the second call as well). In addition we would have appreciated to get recommendations for the area eg restaurants, sightseeing etc. ,

The entree is beautiful and you can park your call easily on one of the various parking slots close to the hotel. You can walk in 5 min to the city center which is nice. Our second room was lovely and exactly what we expected.",positive
"Breakfast was awful. Some staff lovely and some very grumpy.,

Location was great and so was the room",positive
"The gyms equipment is ridiculous and it has no ventilation !,

It is an upscale dormitory with studios with kitchens. Excellent gastropub and the supermarket in the building.",positive

There was an ongoing traffic noise coming from the street.. We struggled to sleep!!,negative

"There is nothing fit for this section :),

The entire place is very spacious and super-comfy. It has all the privacy you need and assistance within minutes if needed.Would recommend to anyone travelling to Grimbergen dor whatever purpose. Really enjoyed my stay! Thank you!",positive
"Cleanliness could have been better. Windows were filthy, floor was a little dirty and in the bathroom there were hairs in the shower from the previous guests.
Food was canteen style but that was to be expected.,

Value for money, location was super central, staff were friendly, breakfast was good, room was spacious, bed was soft and comfortable.",negative
"Very cold bathroom ( visited in february ) , no bulbs in the small lamps,

The location is excellent. Surely enough parking",negative
The best part has been the kitchen full equipped and the late check out. Very very nice stay thanks a lot,positive
"Toilet is badly positioned in bathroom with regard to the door being opened on top of you. 
When the main light is turned off in the bedroom (at night) it also cuts the power to everything, so not possible to charge devices. And even when you go to breakfast and want to charge something, you must leave the light on...in daylight!! 
No toilet brush in bathroom. 
Asked to have a replacement bulb in the bathroom, which still hadn’t been replaced by the time we left. 
The shower temperature fluctuated constantly from very hot to cold. I informed reception. 
Finally, housekeeping didn’t leave enough bath towels and we were asked to go to reception to get more. 
,

Room was a good size for three people. Good black out curtains. And comfortable beds with a choice of firm/soft pillows. Close to the main shopping street. Usual buffet for breakfast, good selection of food, hot and cold.",positive
"nothing was unpleasant.,

Design and decor are pleasant and exciting, coloured and in the common areas, essential and functional in the rooms. The cocktail bar quality has been a welcomed surprise, the italian restaurant serves very good pizzas and antipasti. Definitely worth the visit and staying. I had no chances to visit the roof top bar but since the quality of the ground floor one I don't have any doubt about it. International News channels available for free in on rooms TV.",positive
"NO ROOM SERVICE,

LOCATION",positive
"As others have said, it has an odd layout wiyj lots of stairs & bends. Decor universally brown,

we arrived late after 9pm & went into restaurant at 9.30pm. Initially the maitre'd told us there was no availability, but when they realised we were late arrivals their attitude changed & we got a great steak!",positive
"The shower was tricky to use, shower head in the middle of the bath instead of the top, water destroyed the bathroom and your back to the curtain. It was easier just to remove the head and use it manually. ,

Location location location. Super friendly team at reception",positive
"Really nice big rooms with kitchenette including Nespresso coffee maker, and fashionable deco. Lovely cafe/restaurant on the ground floor.Issues: bad sewer smell in bathroom; windows can’t be open; fire alarm dysfunction meant 4 alarms in the morning resulting in blockage of lifts for subsequent hours... not fabulous to go back/from your room on 6th floor with luggage!",negative
"Excellent breakfast, nice swimming pool, close to the beach",positive
"The worst thing at the ground floor is the very noisy flush of the toilet from upper floors. It's really disgusting and it woke me up during the night many times. Moreover, there are no windows or air vents in the toilet and that's really uncomfortable. ,

The location is perfect to visit the city center and the hosts are very kind. The price is good considering the average in Bruxelles.",negative
"The doors aren’t that good so that you can hear every word spoken in the hallway ,

The interior was really nice as well as staff and the view :)",positive

Nice newly renovated house!",positive

Perfect situation in Antwerpen. Apartment large with terrace.",negative
The bedroom was very disappointing. They certainly need an upgrade. The towels were smelly and old.,negative
"Nothing bad to say.,

Seb is a fantastic host, really friendly and super helpful, offering a lot of tips and tricks, he told us what kind of bus tickets to get, from where, etc., offered all the guidance as to how to find the property, which was very very easy. The studio is cosy, equipped with everything u might need, coffee machine, a little oven, water heater, fridge, so you can prepare your own breakfast. The area is very chilled, super safe and calm, and the old town of Namur is literally less then 10 minutes by bus (number 27). Excellent value for money, great stay, definitely recommend.",positive
"It does not has the free packing,

Very comfortable bed. The kids like the swimming pool very much. Although it is small, but it's enough for the kids.",positive
"Great location, comfy room. The staff were very helpful - overall nothing bad. Good value for the price. COVID measures were in place and the hotel was very clean.",positive
"The room is pretty small.The window of my room is on the ground floor and faces the garden cafe with a lot of people sitting and chatting, so I cannot open my blind, which is not nice.,

Clean and neat, the staff are very friendly and ehlpful.",positive
"The rooms were very hot with no air conditioning and the windows opened up onto a road which was very noisy on a Friday night. It is a shame that no tea or coffee making facilities were provided in the rooms.,

We were given a lovely big room with a double bed and bunk beds in a separate room. The bathroom was lovely and the beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was excellent at an additional cost of 13 euros per person. We were able to park directly outside the hotel and it was just a short walk to the old town and the main attractions. The TV had access to Netflix!",positive
"It’s an old building but everything was in order! ,

The location was super and the staff extremely fiendish and helpful.",positive
"All is still in costruction, Parking is an issue.,

Nice Reception welcome, very friendly super close to the Airport.",positive
"Wi-fi connectivity in the room was poor. 
One member of staff at reception far less friendly from all the others which were great,

Functional - ideal for what we were after. Breakfast was amazing and worth a special mention.",positive
"I was very disappointed with the fact the kitchen annex did not have any cooker (only microwave). I do not use micro wave and the reason why I booked apartment (not the hotel) is that I prefer to cook dinners for myself. The bathroom smelled really badly. First two nights I was alone in the house so it was ok, but when other people moved I realized how bad acoustics the wooden house had: the ceiling, the steps, the doors - you could hear every step in another apartment. Very disturbing. The same regarding the noise from the street - the first two nights I hardly could sleep because of the noise from the street.,

Check in was very easy, spacious apartment, comfortable bed and pillows, efficient central heating, convenient refrigerator, complimentary tea and coffee, perfect location. The apartment was overall very nice, with a lot of interesting books. In general it was clean but some parts (especially the staircase) were covered with quite a collection of dust.",positive
"Nothing,

Excellent breakfast. Time for breakfast fast on sunday till 12 am",positive
"The 3rd adult sleeps in a sofa. They open the sofa immediately so you can use it as a sofa and it’s a rather uncomfortable bed.,

"I thought we would have a bath tub in the room but we had a shower. Also, the wellness spa area was small in my opinion. The pool was a little cold too,

The spacious room, and the young receptionist that checked us in was super nice.",positive
"WARNING this is a one room appartment and they sold it as a two room appartment that is deception for the guests.On this first revieuw the owner defended himself with lies like:Warning!!this client didn’t see the mezzanine with the 2 single beds!!(see on the pictures in the booking.com site!!).So there are 2 rooms!!Moreover he was alone and paid for a single occupancy,so why should he need 2 rooms?This is really frustrating to get such a dishonest comment!!But: I booked this room with my partner and an a extra guests so not alone if he can see in the booking.That's why we need two rooms.No problem if it were two separate rooms as the owner reports but that is not the case.You have to reach the second room by scrambling through a scary dangerous ladder to a attic that looks out onto the double bed of the other room. SO PRIVICY ZERO.Shame on you liar we paid for a two room appartment and we got one.Good luck with you scarry rooms but we never come back.,

The location",negative
"We loved it..,

All",positive
"The breakfast is not very elaborate but it was also not very expensive.,

The room was very comfortable and spacey, the hotel is very well situated. The bath/shower was a little small but it wasn't a problem for us. You need to specify in advance if you want to sleep on the sofa bed, which we didn't do, but the staff was helpful in solving the problem.",positive
"The kitchen is pretty dirty although well-equipped. This property is ok for a one-night stay, but not for longer stays.,

This studio flat is in a perfect location and easy to reach from the motorway. The town centre is half an hour away on foot. The futon is comfortable and the free parking at the property is a bonus.",positive
"air conditioning was broken :-( during superhot week at beginning of Augustpool facilities were messy at the end of the day,

great breakfast, wifi, comfortable room, excellent location",positive
The hotel is hip and slightly eco friendly. A good value for money.,positive
It was seamless as it should be,positive
"As the rooms were newly renovated, it had some 'growing pains' (airco failing, ...), but I'm sure that it will be solved for the people after us !,

Really nice place ! Newly renovated rooms",negative
"The large bed was just 2 beds pushed together but not secured, and they kept moving apart- sleep was not comfortable because of this. The room requires a bit of freshening up of the decor, the room is clean but looks a little grubby. Breakfast was basic, but OK,

The size of the quadruple suite was good for us, plenty of space and facility to make food in the suite. Washing up liquid provided (as rule is to wash all crockery becore leaving), shower was powerful. Location is AMAZING! Staff were all friendly and helpful.",positive
No breakfast but there's a cafe next door.,positive
"Very good breakfast, swimming pool and wellness center. The room was comfortable and quite. The staff friendly.",positive
"The darkness of this old studio, the spider webs in the room, the wardrobe like a cupboard, the shower smells from sewage and the fragrance used in the room to cover this smell makes you sick.,

Location, coffee and tea.",negative
"The bathrooms could do with an up grade.,

Breakfast was not that exciting. The location was great. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. I was going to give the hotel a lower rating, but the front desk staff made me change my mind. Thank you guys for your help in making my stay a happy one.",positive
"check in process was too long,

location, size of the room",positive
"There was nothing to dislike about Serbs studios.,

Seb was very welcoming. He owns a lovely old farmhouse with quirky features. The room was a good size and there were facilities for cooking, coffee machine etc. We stayed one night with our two small dogs while travelling to Venice, Seb did not charge us any extra for the dogs. Due to the rain, he even kindly picked us up from the restaurant that we had walked to.",positive
"Room was above the breakfast area so when they start the morning service, there's sounds of doors opening/closing, furniture moved about.,

Room was good. Good variety at breakfast, also good brasserie (service was also good). Child-friendly hotel (jumping castle in one of the conference rooms, brasserie lounge area provided kids toys).  Check in/out was prompt. Hotel very close to shopping streets (pre) and good restaurants(Het Magazijn,Cjan, Orangerie). Free parking around the marina area, otherwise underground parking across the hotel. Prompt service when there was an issue with one of the beds.",positive
"i can recommend the Room  607, on the top floor, with view to the back, so quiet!",positive

Very nice and clean hotel. Bed was very comfortable for me. Decent location, not too far from Grand Place",positive
"The attitude if the receptionist when we arrived early. He hadn't a clue how to handle customers.,

The location is great and the hotel quirky. Choose your room wisely.",positive

Location",positive
"There were a lot of stairs to climb with heavy luggage and the bathroom situation was unique in that the toilet was separate from the bathroom and it didn't have a sink so you were required to go into the master bedroom every time you needed to wash your hands.,

Easy to get. Very friendly.",negative
"The beds were not comfortable and the room really needed renovation (currently undergoing). The room had a fire alarm with a light,  which was blinking all night long. The room and the bathroom were very cold. The noise from the renovation started at around 9.00 am on a Saturday. The spa area was not well done - only one shower; no separate area to shower or cool down after the sauna; swimming pool is very small and the whole area was very cold. The underground parking entrance was really tight and the tariff is 16 euros (regardless of the time spent in the parking). We had a problem when trying to exit because our ticket (which we had paid at the reception) was not accepted by the machine and the barrier did not open. After turning around several times in the parking, going back to the reception, which could not help, and looking for a way to contact somebody responsible for the parking, we tried again and it worked this time.,

The staff was very nice and helpful. The room is a good size and the location is convenient. The wellness centre (swimming pool, sauna and gym) are free but are not well done (see the comments below) and need renovation. The hotel is currently being renovated so hopefully the wellness area will also be redone. The room service for breakfast was really good and the service in the restaurant was excellent (the food was pretty basic though).",negative
"We have chosen the hotel because of the location  and swimming pool.
There was no air-conditioning 
very small ventilator 
no rules to use the swimming pool during the corona.
The swimming pool was always crowded with the same people.
we have tried to enter in the swimming pool on a Saturday at 17h45 but then it was closed because there was a party.
information about the party was not given in the reception.

the location of the hotel is fantastic and the hotel was very clean.",negative
I booked it for my boss (for work purposes) and he actually loved it!,positive
"The maid seems to be of short posture as at various higher areas the room was not as clean as it could have been.one morning the receptionist forgot to order a taxi despite the hand written noteone morning the receptionist got the time wrong (to early, still at breakfast), I ended up to have to pay for the taxi waitingone morning the taxi did not show up... Note.. taxi is not really needed in Namur once can easily walk as long as your destination is the center.,

This hotel is a unique place. Offers comfort, good breakfast. Location is central and has an excellent in-house restaurant. All you need.",positive

"Nothing to report.,

We booked a weekend away to the coast in Belgium an found this hotel in Blankenberg by coincidence.
The reviews of this hotel caught my attention aswell the value for money. We did not hesitate to make a reservation, and we absolutely do not regret it. It was the perfect choice.
The hotel itself including the facilities, the rooms and the staff are outstanding and they do their job really professional and always welcoming for any questions you have. Always a smile on their face, they made us feel so welcoming.
My wife and I we can only recommend this property and we will definitely come back to it.
Moreover, the breakfast in the morning is an absolute beauty!! Outstanding and really attentive staff!! :)
Recommend by 2 happy weekenders from Luxembourg.",positive
"We had a Studio Room on the 1st floor. Didn't like the following: plastic mattress cover under the sheet, the toilet location (next to the kitchen), dank mouldy smell in the entrance hallway, the bathroom that turned into a steamy wet room because of no ventilation and there did not appear to be an easily accessible fire escape for a place that has wooden floors and stairs (although I must admit we did not ask).,

Location was good and an easy walk to the main square. Nearby parking was very secure even at 22 euro a day.",negative
"Comfortable and spacious room, nice breakfast",positive
"The rooms decoration is really minimal and without personality. It is a cold atmosphere even for a business hotel.The balcony is big, but in our case the view was on a really sad street and buildings in front. The services are good, but the line at the reception was always super long for anything and there was always quite a big crowd hanging in there which didn't make it very reassuring from a Covid point of view. the food for dinner was ok for an ""emergency"" dinner but quite overpriced for the quality.,

The staff was kind. The location was central despite not super nice neighbourhood.The service for the dinner was quick and the breakfast was good. The size of the room is big. The common parts at the are really nice, but not enjoyable at this moment because of the covid restrictions.Overall the experience was positive, but the hotel and especially the rooms, lack charme and personality.",negative
"While it’s a dog-friendly apartment, the immediate area isn’t good for walking dogs. That isn’t the owner’s fault, of course, it’s just how it is. The room was nice and had everything we needed, but the double bed didn’t have a proper frame so was on the floor. That may not be a problem for many people, but for me it was because I have very bad knees and can’t get up easily from the floor. Also, the bathroom was very nice but has a metal floor (I assume so that it’s easy to clean), which was VERY cold in the winter. However, we did mention this as a suggestion on Seb’s suggestion board so hopefully that won’t be an issue soon. ,

It was very close to the motorway, and quite close to Namur centre. We liked that they allow dogs and that they have all of the facilities you’d need (beds (one double, one single), table and chairs, kitchen area including sink, microwave and kettle) were all in one room, with a separate en-suite bathroom. It was great that we could both check in and check out late, and Seb is really friendly",positive
"On 2nd floor in family room it’s nice to have curtains on a bathtub. Friends on 3rd floor had newer bathroom.
But that hasn’t changed our preception of a great stay.,

Very nice and helpful staff both at the reception and at the restaurant.
Comfortable family room. Great pillows.
Amazing breakfast.",positive
"The only problem is that there are no ""rules"" for the pool. Parents drop of their kids, and they terrorised everything during our stay there. Dropped people's phones in the water, spit and coughed in the water, parents were nowhere aloud. This was a big issue for me and my friend as we really looked forward to finally having a Holiday. As per rest very very nice stay!,

Loved how friendly the staff was, amazing room, amazing rooftop, nice and clean heated pool. Will book again for sure!",positive
"The shower leaks all over the floor, the ‘double bed’ was 2 single mattresses on a double frame which made sleeping standards much lower.,

The staff let us check in at 9am when we arrived and were extremely friendly. Air conditioning worked well and stayed on even when key was out so room was lovely and cool to come into after a heatwave outside",positive
No curtain in the bathtub - Taking shower results in splashing water all over.,positive
"All of the above!,

The location was fabulous. Unfortunately, the hotel could do with being bulldozered into the ground. Our room had a toilet so small that my knees were against the door whilst I was sitting on the throne. It was the size of a broom cupboard, with neither a window, a vent, or an extractor fan to 'freshen' the air after use. When finished, we then had to cross the room to the tiny bathroom to wash our hands. The room had a prolific damp problem, whereby large parts of the carpet were wet, and the whole of the hotel had a musty, mildewy smell. The breakfast was ok, but the selection was quite small. The cellar, which is the dining room, was the best room in the place, in my opinion. The staff were wonderful, and couldn't be more helpful, but that wouldn't be anywhere near enough for me to go back there.",negative
"No refund given....COVID 19,

Nothing...",negative
"The fact we had two simple beds instead of one double bed . The wellness room was also pretty small and we could not go to the Sauna or Hammam ,

The breakfast. The swimming pool. Thé beautiful room. The fact we could get one extra bottle of water.",positive
"some sound insulation could be nice. you hear the people walking upstairs and also too much noise and cold air coming from the windows. the door is also very old, doesnt make you feel safe in the room. we had a kitchen in the room but just with a microwave, kettle and some cups. no oven, nothing to cook, even no cutlery. had a coffee machine, thoug.,

staying at an apartment frm 17. century is a nice experience. the room was nicely decorated. the owner is also friendly, he leaves his tips for Brussel in the room so that you do not need to spend a lot of time on internet looking for what to do or eat. the location is also good, 15 minutes walk from the city hall. there are nice restaurants aorund.",positive
"cold shower if you do not know the tricks of the kind engineer,

kindest staff",positive
"The lighting is the bathroom was almost absent, it would be nice to light up the bathroom. Also the room was poorly lit to our taste, but guess some people might like dim ambience.,

Very nice location, spacious room and comfortable bed. The shower was also good and relaxing we had to pickup from the buffet and eat it at our room, nonetheless the breakfast was good and typical of what you could expect from a decent hotel. There is a paid parking right next door, very convenient and with some discount from the hotel it costs 13,5€/day. Had good stay and will not hesitate to come back again.",positive
Seb's place is conveniently located not far from the main road to Brussels so useful if you're driving. There's an Aldi close by so we could buy and make our own food at the studio. The private bathroom and WiFi made our stay easy.,positive

Great location,good restaurant,close to bars,restaurants,river.",positive
"It is a 2 star hotel so it was pretty much as expected and would be wrong to complain about stuff that pretty much matched the star rating! Small room and basic furnishings and toiletries...buy as I expected so not a complaint,

The location is worth it! Right next to the Bell tower and perfect for exploring around the Centre.",negative

Great location to old Brussels.  I liked the independent access to the room.  Shower had nice hot water available!  Landlord was very accessible.  An easy stay in the city.",positive
"Bathroom when arrived in the room was not totally clean.,

Location, size of the room. Very friendly reception. Had to change room due to noise (next to the lift) and the hotel gladly changed it.",negative
"We stayed there 2 nights, including NYE. There were unfortunately a few parties (not allowed) but the hotel handled it well and called the police. The first night there was also quite some noise in the room above us, but again, the hotel was not to blame for this. No other complaints at all.,

The studio with kitchen was great for us (2 adults one small child). It was very clean and the location was perfect, very close to the train station and also walking distance to the historical city center. Breakfast was good value as well.",positive
"Having to sit or kneel in the bath for a shower. The key did not come out of the lock in a usual way and this should have been indicated. There was a need for more more paint to have been used. The floor was in need of some better covering.  The crockery was not of an acceptable standard. I think it was the worst place my wife and i have ever stayed in.,

Not much. The price was good, but standards should be better. The beds were comfortable, but one was a futon with little access to it.",negative

Stylish and classy with some interesting features. Breakfast was absolutely incredible. One of the best I've ever had",negative

"Coffee facilities and some free water in rooms would be a place for such trips.,

Very nice hotel with very nice lobby bar and in a good location which is walking distance to the EU Institutions and close to Park. Restaurant across the road from hotel is also very good.",positive
"It has a minibar -  but not tea or coffee making facilities. The breakfast was a bit disappointing for the size and quality of the hotel.,

Amazing hotel, it is like a labyrinth though, with lots of tiny and crazy staircases. Each time we left our third floor room  we ended up going a different way to the reception (and once was though the kitchen!!). Bot wow what a room, more a suite really, it was quirky, comfortable and beautiful with a fabulous spa bath. The best room we have stayed in! The hotel is also only a short walk into the city centre.",positive
"Spare pillows in the cupboard looked like they hadnt had clean pillow cases on so couldnt use them. Pillows most uncomfortable.,

The quaintness of the hotel and close to the centre of bruge.",negative
"The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I do not have the name of the lady from the check-in, she was really great, but Alejandro from check-out did also a fantastic job. I can truely reccomend this place.",positive
"Extremely expensive parking,

Nice airy room, good saunas and staff at the reception were helpful and thoughtful, we had few troubles with arriving late and wanted to cancel but they found solution so we stayed there.",positive
"The apartment is accessed through narrow hallways and by narrow wooden stairs (gives the feeling of a very old house), nevertheless the apartment has a cosy feeling inside. The doors of all the apartments are quite old and don't have the proper sound proofing, so you don't feel isolated from the rest of the house. Also the locks are ordinary old room locks, do not seem very secure.,

The apartment has a cosy and warm vibe to it. The space is generous and nicely organized. The check-in and check-out are efficient (no reception).",positive
"In the room - only the synthetic curtain in the bathtub - if it gets damp, it is a bit unpleasant. I did not understand the system of guarantee and did not have a credit card, but fortunatelly, I did not have to provide one in the end (until now, I don't understand what I was asked for and why).,

I stayed in Bloom several times 10 years ago in 2009 and I was delighted to return and find that everything was more or less the same in 2020. I liked unique decoration in each room, it is certainly refreshing to find such concept. The rooms are reasonably large, have everything one needs especially for short stays (tea, coffee etc.), and the breakfast is great. And I felt that the price has actually dropped in comparison with the high rates I was used to from the past. Close to the metro station (Jardin) Botanique. I loved it back then and still like it.(I did not find the rooms in particular ""need of renovation"", they were just fine and good value. I am actually a bit sad that the artistic decorations may be gone fafter the planned rennovation this summer and the place would become more ordinary.)",positive
"Room was not 100% correct, missing wall paint. Some lights don't work...have to be test before please.,

Staff very kind and professional Suite bed is very comfortable !",positive
Two thumbs up!,positive
"The hot breakfast choice was somewhat limited,

The waffles were great!",positive
"Bathroom could have been much cleaner. There was hair in the shower sink and the shower curtain had toothpaste stains. Wellness is charged separately at €44 per person. ,

Cool rooms and decor. Good prices and pool bar plus wellness option available. Spacious room.",positive
"Again, the lack of phones in the rooms is a let-down.  It wasn't until I woke up in the morning that I decided on a late checkout.  The lack of a phone in the room meant I used my phone to call the front desk - which was an international call for me, by the way.  They insisted I had to go down to the desk to arrange and pay for my late check-out.  That was really inconvenient.  It would have been nice to do it from the comfort of the room.,

Just like the previous time I stayed here, I really enjoyed my stay. It's a shame that I only had one night as I would have loved to stay longer. And I like the fact that I could do a late check-out and, basically, stay till 3pm.  This was really good for me as it enabled me to get some work done.  And I can see the attraction for couples because they don't have to rush to get out by noon :-)",positive

"Clean, quiet and cozy room, birds singing in the morning. Within 30 min walk from the centre of the city. And of course an amazing host. When leaving, we accidentally took the keys with us and realised it too late (damn, so sorry for that...), and Sebastien took that situation with great understanding. Next time we won't forget the keys I promise :)",positive

"The stairs to the apartment were a little  bit too narrow and unsafe.,

Good location, with lots of bars, restaurants and grocery stores nearby",positive
"Breakfast is not included in the room rate and 24 eur/pp is a fortune to pay. Parking is very expensive as well, the guests may use the parking lots in the area which are free of charge after 9pm.,

Although this NH is not located in the historic city center, it is a 15-20 mins walk to Grand Place and very well connected to other parts of the city through subway and tram. We really liked the interior design of the rooms and the staff was very helpful too.",positive

Bed sheets although clean were obviously faded and old as were towels. Lamp faulty, flickered then didn't work, wasn't the bulb. Music below loud and late at night.

The apartment had great facilities and was very clean. Very good size.
Lieve (sorry if I spelt your name incorrectly) was wonderful and very welcoming. She explained to us  what needed to be done especially with recent events of COVID-19  and what was available for us to do as a family in Antwerp. She provided us with a map and marked which areas we could visit. She made our stay in Antwerp one to remember.
Definitely coming back to Premier Suites Plus Antwerp. Thank you.",positive

An enchanting, historic, 17th century house, with amazing decoration. It is not just accommodation but the pride and joy of the owner - who is very friendly and welcoming. Well equipped, well located, a house with a character!",positive
The staff were very nice and friendly.,positive
"More channels on room TV? Nothing else comes to mind...,

Everything was great. Food was great both at the hotel restaurant and breakfast with room-service (price-included). Ventilation in the room was helpfull during hot summer night. Swimming pool, elevator straight from underground parking, etc. It was a pleasure.",positive
"I understand the owner does not charge cleaning fees and that is why they are requesting the guests to clean the dishes they use in the small kitchenette, but nothing is stopping them from charging those cleaning fees and save us the trouble of having to wash dishes on our vacation. For a short 2-3 days stay, I found that to not be very enjoyable. A good cutting knife would be handy too since the kitchen is provided, so guests can make better use of it; salt and pepper would have been much appreciated too.
The reason why I mentioned cleaning was not the best is because there were web cobs hanging in the top corner of our door, otherwise the room itself inside felt quite clean.
Wifi not very strong and at some point we couldn't connect to it anymore, not sure if this could have been fixed if we asked for it.
Please note that as the listing says, this studio is in a very old building with very squeaky stairs and flooring, so if you are a light sleeper, this might not be the best place for you, as you can hear people coming in and out of the building, walking around in the apt above or next to you and there is also considerable traffic noise throughout the night coming from the street outside, even with the window open. This was not a major issue for us, but it is important to be mentioned, if you are looking for a quiet accommodation.
Lastly, it needs to be mentioned that the bathroom, although private, inside the room, has a slight feeling that it was later added within the room space, in what might have been a wardrobe, as the doors to the bathroom look like wardrobe doors and they don't really close properly, so it makes for some situations to be a bit uncomfortable - definitely would not recommend it for new couples, unless very comfortable with each other and no privacy issues. It does serve its purpose of having a private bathroom, albeit the shower cabin is tiny, but the water pressure is good, the water was hot and there were plenty of towels...,

The size of the room was great, it also had a nice comfy sofa, the small kitchen had most necessary items and even some jams and chocolate spread available for guests to use - please note there is no stove or toaster available, so maybe not suitable for long stays if you are planning to cook for yourself.Location was good too, not very central, but easy to find at the end of a street coming from the centre. We were able to walk all the time and it wouldn't take us more than say 15 minutes from the grand plaza.I can comfortably say this is very good value for money if you are looking for an authentic experience and staying only for a few days. Communication with the host was also very good.",positive

This seemed very sensitive and we worked out in the end that it was triggered by people walking across the floor of the apartment above. We assume that it is mandatory to have a sensor operated light in Ghent, but if this could be adjusted that would be an improvement. But this was a small detail.,

We loved our stay in Hof Van Spanje. The rooms were stylishly decorated, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped and well set out and we liked having different seating areas, at the dining table and in the sofa area. We could not have asked for more.",positive

"Asked what time the bar closed as we planned to get back for anniversary drinks after our meal. 
Was told 10, got there at about 9.30 and they wouldn’t serve us just glass of Bailey’s  each as they wanted to close early. Despite us politely explaining that we’d come back early to meet the timings they told us, that there were 4 people in the bar with full drinks, that it was a special occasion and we didn’t plan to be long, he said no and just shrugged.
Really disappointing as the hotel room was very nice and the small bar looked lovely - if only we could have enjoyed it. ,

"The front desk reception was very unfriendly at the check in. 
No any words of welcoming.
I didn’t have the same ID with me as the one I used for the online pre check in. This was a big issue😳 I almost left the hotel, so unbelievable unfriendly.
I am the owner of hotel in The Netherlands and I would immediately fire my employé with this kind of attitude. Send him to a course to learn him hospitality!,

It is a cool hotel",negative
"Amazing room, good facilities, perfect location",positive
"Loved this apartment, perfect central location. Excellently stocked kitchen and lovely welcome (thanks for the bottle of wine!). Highly recommend and would happily stay again.",positive
Dirty old room with bad mattress and stains all over.  Do not recommend it to anyone.  Rude employees.  A business made to take your money and offer the worst possible experience.  Big problems with the room.  Very dirty overall.  Avoid at all cost.,negative
"Amazing stay. I wen't to Belgium for professional reasons and i found that this hotel was really perfect. Calm, modern decoration, very friendly staff and near the Detla station and Carrefour, this hotel has everything we need to spend a great and productive time.
Thank you!",positive
"The Wi-Fi wasn't great. It wasn't stable, which made using it really annoying. Also, we were on 3rd floor, which doesn't get much sun, so the room was coldish, so we had to get extra blankets!,

The location of the hotel is superb - everything is at walking distance and the Brussels Central train station is near by, which was very convenient for traveling via train. The room is very compact and comfortable. It's being cleaned every day and the towels are changed frequently.",positive
"Would skip restaurant - service was slow, food mediocre.,

Nice hotel.  Trendy.  Clean.  Our room was a little outdated but felt safe and comfortable.",positive
"Nothing,

Really friendly and helpful hosts in a super property",positive
"There was no fan or window in the bathroom hence the bathroom was very smelly after use.  Although  it was very quiet on our floor I could easily hear the people upstairs. We got one of the rooms without sauna and jacuzzi and even in the middle of the night at 1 am I heard the noise of people upstairs in their jacuzzi. The room was also very dry, generally I would improve the air conditions system. ,

The property is indeed a historical building with very interesting inner architecture. The room was spacious",negative
"The room was a little dusty and bathroom was not as good as the rest of the room,

The room size, the location, and the staff were very friendly",positive
"Great, funcky place in Brussels. great for kids and couples.",positive
"The bathroom was very small and did not have hooks or rails to hang the towels,

The room had character and was comfortable. A generous continental breakfast was served in the room, which was a lovely way to start the day. The shower was excellent. The hotel is only a few minutes' walk from the Markt.",positive
"Nothing.,

Beautiful spacious apartment  near center of old city",positive
"The small tv was a nice addition, only few channels, and often bad signal.Other than that, I can't say anything bad.Met the expectations of a budget holiday, basic, but you get everything you need!,

The location was excellent, very close to the market, next to the belfort.It is a budget hotel, so it's a little bit basic, but it had everything I needed.Small kitchen, a bath and a nice bed!When I first came in, the room was very clean.The staff was very friendly, I came to check in, and I was offered a room with a kitchen, as my original one didn't have one.",positive
"The hotel was modern, clean, staff was extremely friendly, and had a free breakfast. I would recommend this place to anyone.",positive
"I had a problem with an invoice. After the check out I was said that I cannot obtain an invoice because the room was paid via Booking.com. So I leave without any invoice. But in the confirmation from Booking.com is written an instruction about the invoice from the provider! A have paid via Booking several times and in all cases a have obtained the invoice at the hotel! Booking.com do not provide an invoice but only a receipt.,

Breakfast was perfect. The hotel is clean and comfortable.The place is very good.",positive

Location close to railway station",positive
"My other colleagues talked about your delicious break first - a bit annoyed to not have access to it but anyway, next time :D,

Everything was enough, i enjoyed my stay.",positive
"Check in was amazing but staff after that where OK, when we left the maid jumped in the room and we left over 2 hours before check out and upon check out we where not asked how our stay was.
Alos cot was not put up we had to chase it up. 
The coffee/tea cups are so so small. ,

Location and it was very clean food is also amazing.",positive
"The location was excellent, except - on Friday night the nearby nightclub music was blaring well into the early morning making sleep very much impossible. I don’t know how this can be remedied, but short of noise ordinance after 0200. Most of my stay was during the weekday, and except for Friday, it was quiet and perfect!!!,

This property is BEAUTIFUL! Clean, classy. A kitchen to prepare meals if you don’t want to eat out every night. The living/dining area is very nice plus, there is a rooftop deck patio for dining. The location was on a square surrounded by dozens of fine eating, drinking and dining and is easy walking distance to everything.Fully recommend!",positive
"You are supposed to hear ring bell from Belfort. It's not annoying but sometimes... you may be surprised.,

Very close to the markt and belfort. You can see the Belfort in your room! If you want to travel Brugge based on the Makrt, this hotel would be great choice for you.",positive
"The rooms are nice but could be a bit more complete given the price. They could provide more shampoos etc and more wardrobe space.,

Nice design of hotel, friendly and professional staff. Great location. Comfortable bed.",positive
"Room was very cold. Even with full heating on the was feeling of cold air. 
All furnitures are heavily used. ,

Location is the best part.",positive
"nothing,

Breakfast was fantastic as with out previous stay. Outside in the garden with home picked fruits, home made yoghurt, fresh eggs from their own hens and honey from their bees. The best breakfast we have had in a bed and breakfast and is our standard to beat. Rooms very comfortable and as it hit 40 degrees on our visit the air conditioning in the bedroom was fantastic.",positive
All at the top!,positive
"The only thing I can think of is that you have to close one part of the curtains, otherwise people walking down the corridor or sitting outside their room on the terrace could look into the room. ,

The room (nr 707) was a nicely decorated suite, with a well equipped and clean kitchen (but only used Nespresso machine and kettle, with provided coffee and tea). Kids on the sofa bed, us parents on one of the most comfortable beds ever. Bathroom was nicely decorated and very clean. Outside is a small (roof)terrace with a few chairs and tables. Parking is next to the hotel, you get a 5 € discount from hotel. Very close to the shopping street (2 min walk), but about 15-20 min to Grote Markt and surroundings.",positive

Swimming pool and roof top bar",positive
"It’s all good,

Good quality fixtures and fittings",positive
"Nothing of note.,

Very easy key exchange with the owner.",positive
Location is amazing,positive
"Highly recommend this wonderful little gem. Perfectly located, quiet street and was stocked with more staples than any other place we’ve stayed ( ie: coffee, tea, cereal, clear and accessible information). My 7 year old daughter was thrilled and feeling like a princess in her own attic bedroom...
The only note is that it is NOT for anyone without high mobility as the first staircase is extremely steep and the second staircase is more like a ladder... and all beds are upstairs. There is, however, a comfortable couch on the main floor. We would certainly stay here again if/when we return to fairytale Bruges.",positive
"The room is very small. Travelling as a couple with two suitcases made it difficult to move around the room.,

The property is very comfotable, clean and has a great location. Its within walking distance from Grand Place.",positive

"Breakfast,

Nice room and kind staff",positive
"Our room (Marilyn Munroe Room) was at the front of the property, over looking the t'Zand and had lovely high ceilings and large windows, lovey and airy and beautifully decorated.  Property was very close to the t'Zand underground parking in Bruges and central for all of the old city.Continental breakfast was served in the comfort of our room, which was great.Staff very warm and welcoming.",positive
"Bedrooms were quite hot - maybe a couple of fans to cool them down would be a good idea. ,

Great location for exploring Ghent. Spacious for 4 guests. 
Outdoor terrace to enjoy the sunny weather.",positive
"Excellent location. Great value for money. The man at the reception was very friendly, informative and helpful.10/10",positive
"It’s nothing to say.,

Very close to City centre!",positive
"Not much; no safety box or kettle in room.,

A very nice, comfortable hotel in a good location, near to the centre and only a few minutes walk from central station. Rooms were very clean and modern and the lounge was a great to relax in. Breakfast was excellent with high quality, organic produce. All the staff were very welcoming, helpful and friendly. I was able to check in to the room earlier than expected, which was really appreciated and the lady in reception (I think Sandrine was her name) was very helpful in giving information on transport and directions to nearby places etc. When I needed to cancel one of the days, Tammy was very helpful in sorting it out. Would highly recommend this hotel and will come again during next visit to Brussels.",positive

Good hotel, good restaurant and good value for money",positive
"the bathroom interior in one of our rooms was a bit tired.,

Serviced appartments - own kitchen, Central location (2 mins walk to train station, 10 mins walk to the old town), spacious rooms, clean, modern.",positive
"Unfortunately the restaurant was renovated during our stay and the replacement breakfast was a little expensive (5€) for what was offered (pastries, bananas, apples, yoghurt and coffee). However, we really enjoyed our stay, not really a downside.,

We especially liked the interoir design of the hotel and the bar and pool area. The view from the rooftop is spectacular. The hotel is in one of the nicest areas of brussels with loads of nice Restaurants and Bars nearby!",positive
"No reception, unusual entrance through the restaurant or back door, steep stairs. These small inconveniences are acceptable but you should know about them in advance.,

A room on the second floor with a view on tiled roofs, the tower of the Basilica. The staff is always ready to help and answer questions. Seating area in the room is very cozy (comfortable armchairs, tea corner) and gives you great chance to discuss your day drinking a cup of tea. The breakfast distinctive served in the room was very atmospheric and tasty. It is a GREAT ADVANTAGE of the hotel (still I have great desire to repeat it).",positive
"The apartment has a beautiful roof terrace overlooking Gent. 
Location is perfect with all major sites within ca. 15min walking distance.
The apartment is beaitiful, well equipped with a lot of space. 
The landlord was super nice. Xheckin/out was easy as there is a restaurant in the same building which helps to manage.",positive

"Loud neighbours. Didn’t like that, but not owners fault.,

Very nice stay. Place is comfortable and styled in a warm and origanal stile. Hosts are very welcomming and breakfast is just fabulous. Unfortunately there was an unusually loud party going on late in the night by the neighbours. No fault of the owners, but it messed with my sleep. Great beds also.",positive
"We asked to film in our room and it was not allowed till to ask the manager,and the manager wasn’t around,so we didn’t do what brought us to that city,we regret,

Was soo clean",negative
The location of the apartments was great - right in the heart of everything. The apartment was nice and clean and the amenities were good too - everything we needed for a family of four for our two night stay. The only negative was the lack of security at the adjoining carpark - our car was broken into on our first night! The hotel offers a slight discount to leave the car in this car park but be careful if using it.,positive
"There were renovations going on so there wasn’t a restaurant for a proper breakfast and the games room wasn’t open.,

It was very clean and had a lovely terrace and pool area.",positive
"Nothing it was all perfect.,

Absolutely outstanding, loved having it bought to the room. Such a lovely touch. Plenty of choice and boiled eggs perfectly cooked. Set us up for the day.",positive
"Stairwell smelled really bad. Kitchen was okay but could have been better equipped for those who wanted to cook much.,

Fantastic location and beautiful apartment.",positive
Very nice place and friendly people.,positive
The location of the place within Bruges was amazing. Quick to reach everything by foot while not having all tourists look into you window when you are cooking or having a meal at the nice table in the living space.,positive
"No kettle or room facilities of that sort. They have a common iron room. Need to walk some 10 minutes from central station. With luggage it is bit difficult.,

Can have a short walk to tram station to reach nearby place.",positive
"Dinner in the restaurant took an age. A simple entrecote and fries took 50 minutes to arrive from the time of ordering. I was told it was very busy. People were complaining to the staff so I'd check waiting times before ordering in the restaurant.  ,

I have stayed here before. It has good, spacious, clean rooms and a good little fitness centre. The hotel is well located close to Botanique metro and the staff are helpful and friendly.",positive
"Everything was great. The owners take care of every detail in this B&B.Breakfast is azing with all home made food, we liked especially the jams, the yogurt and the fresh bread.It is also close to many WWI sites by bike or by car.",positive
The restaurant and facilities are very beautiful and nice,positive
"The breakfast was a bit pricey. Travelling with 2 children and the price was the same for all of us when my two hardly eat anything!,

The room was very clean and spacious. Plenty of towels.",positive
"dim hallways.  game room was closed due to renovation.,

We liked the sleeping arrangements;  very unique design.  The hallways were too dim for my taste but everything else was good.  Very clean;  staff was accommodating.  Enjoyed the tiny pool; and the rooftop bar.",positive
"Not a dislike but staff is not always around I think. I’ve waited some time for anybody to open the door.. Again at check out, I’ve looked for somebody to drop the keys off. It took some time.,

Location can not be better! Great comfort! Superbly clean flat!",positive
"Ventilation and shower facilities can be imlroved,

Location is the best feature. Hotel room tends to be noisy due to other guests talking and smoking in the top floor terrace in late Night hours. Breakfast is ok, constraints due to COVID regulations understandable.ventialtion and air conditioning in rooms can be improved.",negative
Beautiful home. Welcoming hosts. Great location. Perfect property to spend our Christmas in! Thanks again,positive
Beds extra comfort. Clean.,positive
"The bed was a little hard but not really bad. The room was quiet but if you are near the elevators you hear sometimes the doors opening and closing and the people who use them talking. Again, nothing really bad.,

Big spacious room, comfortable bathroom. Safe, coffee maker, fridge and complimentary water. And an advent calendar with chocolates ! The towels had a decorative lining the same color of the bathroom sink. Good touch. Very good location, near metro and tram, you can go anywhere easily. Also near gare du Nord. Good and helpful staff. Excellent Wifi.Shops nearby, including rue Neuve in 10' walk. Restaurants nearby (mostly turkish at chaussee de Haecht, all types between Rue royale et Madou)",positive
Its the third time we have stayed at this super property...................I think that says enough ? beautiful house superb hosts. If only you could award 11 out of 10 !!,positive
"only one point is the surcharge of 4 euros (not a big amount but a surprise), as I registered via Booking....",positive
"It's a shame there's no daily cleaning. Just basic stuff like beds made, fresh towels, and stocking up of coffee and soap would make it perfect.
Mattress & cushions a bit on the soft side, but that is very personal of course...,

Perfect location, friendly staff and clean, modern accommodation. Did not use kitchen facilities, but very well equipped and perfect for longer stays.
Would certainly repeat.",positive
Great pool and rooftop bar,positive
"The beds were rather hard and not very comfortable.  Our two teens opted to sleep on the couch, which is HUGE.  My kids are very tall and fit fine,

This place is exactly as seen in the photos.  There is a big wow factor when entering!  The location is fabulous!!  It's an easy, short walk to everywhere you want to be, there are lively pubs on the street, a fruit market and public square are right out the door.We liked almost everything!The toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom.  This was very helpful for our group of 4.We would absolutely return.Be aware that it is on the top floor, so step climbing is mandatory.The upper balcony is a fantastic place!!!",positive
The furniture was old...,negative
"Only one toilet
,

beautiful house for a weekend!",positive
The staff,positive
"With the high price I paid for the breakfast they could have had some more items, such as fried eggs and maybe hashbrowns, to cater to international guests. Also the juices in the breakfast were not kept cold and few of them taste very bad as they were off by end of the breakfast serving time :( It is best to keep milk and juice cold for safety reasons!,

Very nice hotel, breakfast was one of the best I have had on my trip so far! The room was very spacious and clean! Staff were also very professional",positive
"Nothing,

Facilities were fantastic. Breakfast was excellent with home made fruit juice, yoghurt, fresh fruit salad, breads, cheeses, meats, jams eggs. Just fantastic. Honesty bar with a great selection of local beers and wines. Comfortable beds. And recommendations for places to visit and eat.",positive
"Very noisy. The room was next to the restaurant and under the roof top bar. So a lot of noise until approx. 11 PM. At around 5 AM the cleaning of the restaurant floor etc. started, so not much quiet time.The pillows weren't great.Dining at the grill restaurant did not meet expectations. It sounded great, but was just about mediocre.No safe in the room.,

Friendly service, location close to city center.The room was very large with a nice bathroom.",negative
"Both tv’s reacted at the same time with the rc, parking sucked. But the rest SUPER!,

Super room :) terras was nice and beds were confy",positive
"It was very hot so not possible to sleep in the cupboard bed and had to move onto the floor. The hotel provided fans but they did not reach all 5 people in the room.

The room was stunning, views incredible. The kids loved the (tiny) pool. It was lovely.",positive
"The stairs!!!,

Extra comfy beds!!!",positive
"Not much to say, the accommodations were great,

The room was clean, wifi was strong, bed was comfortable and I didnt hear much of the outside world even with window open. Its slightly off main tourism so it helped",positive
"While description does tell you about steep stairs house is on 3 floors and the only loo is on the ground floor. We chose it to self cater, only a microwave.,

Traditional, light airy, clean. Nathan and Lyn friendly.",positive
"There was nothing I could fault it on,

Loved the location, the bed,the staff and the decor. Will definitely come again and recommend.",positive
"Noisey rooms. Clearly audible Humming sounds of aircon in the room, noise from the street because of older window closings.,

Personnel was super friendly",positive
Wonderful breakfast and accommodation,positive
"Surprisingly, some of the little things in the room were missing.  For example, there were no tissues in the bedroom, and no trash can except the one in the bathroom.,

The room was very clean and a good size.  The bathroom was very big, and had both a shower and a bathtub with a jacuzzi.  I had a meal at one of the restaurants at the hotel, the food was excellent, and a great value for money.",positive
"They only clean your room once a week , and that’s not enough ,,, but extra towels are always available at the reception",positive
"Feels like an example of style over substance at jam. I get they’re projecting a style and creating a cool brand to appeal to a youngish, funky clientele. However I still expect some basic level of service at E250+ per night. Parking was a joke and after a 6 hour drive I don’t appreciate the stress of having to run from bars to various shops and cafes near the hotel, to get change for street parking. If the hotel can’t provide a better parking solution, it should at s minimum be able to offer guests change for the street parking. Room was boiling hot but shouldn’t complain about the weather - a curtain that opens to allow the window to open easily would’ve been useful. Roof bar and pool terrace was nice. Looked like a number of clients were dealing with Saturday afternoon hangovers / come downs. Fine if that’s your thing but maybe not the place for a youngish family. Breakfast was ok and really pushes the self service to its limit. Providing a hot plate for hungover hipsters to cook their own eggs and burn themselves was pushing the minimalist style / service offering too far for me. An actual, real person cooking eggs would provide a better experience and wouldn’t break the bank. Jam has a defined style and could be special by turning up the service levels a little, themselves.,

Location, design, funky roof top vibe",positive
"We liked everything ,

All of it. Great location, in the center of the city. Very good apartment,  big rooms, high ceilings, clean, well decorated,  comfortable beds. We had such a great time there.",positive
"The TV is a long way from the bed and is a small TV so pointless where it is. Bath is a little dirty.,

Location was great",negative
"Beautiful design house, very kind owners wonderful location",positive
"It was all fabulous.,

The staff were friendly and helpful and assisted with extra assistance as I am a wheelchair user. The breakfast was superb - organic, fresh produce. I lovely stay. The location was very central.",positive
"The decor in the rooms were a bit dated and the sheets and pillows were not the most comfortable. There was also no room service so you have to go down to the restaurant to eat. The location is also not the greatest in terms of sightseeing in the city.,

Staff was very friendly and the restaurant provided good options for dinner. The workout room was also spacious and had a good amount of equipment.",negative
"Rooms too hot,

Staff",positive
The room was comfortable,positive

Nice cooling off pool and bar",positive
"Nothing ,

Great flats in the centre of town, superbly styled and comfortable.",positive
"Breakfast was extra cost and I didnt try it.Room was small and beds were almost pilled up.Room had dirty carpet and the towels had hair from other people.Bathroom could surely use a renovation(reminded me of old hotels that were renovated back in the 80's)As long as i had the balcony door open the room was okay but after one hour that door was closed the smell of the dirty carpet and the not properly air ventillated room was intense.Televison had only 10 channels (none of them in english audio or english subs)Television was ""smart but didnt have wifi connection"" plus no internet connection on the TV itself.The faucet was damaged and spilling water to the ground.Curtains had poor light insulation due to being worn out and one of them was out of guide rail.In the back side (terace) there is a pub and it was loud until 1am.,

the room that i got offered had a nice balcony.",negative
"Our bed was uncomfortable,

Staff was helpful, especially Rachid who helped us with all the information regarding the transport to the airport.",positive
"WiFi in room was spotty and very slow ,

Spacious room, central location, close to metro and supermarkets",positive

Comfortable bed, spacious room, great curtains.",positive
"I couldn't sleep because of the noise of the ventilation ( not airco ) . A real catastrophe .I thought is was the hot off the kitchen , but no .,

Size of the room +terras .",negative
"they are advertising pool temperature at 28 degrees, yet it was definitely not heated on both our stays there",positive
"Thje hand basins were too small and we would have preferred a proper shower not one over the bath,

The location was great apart from noisy concerts in the nearby square",positive
It was next to the Grote Markt! Excellent location!,positive
"the shower was higher up on the floor than the rest of the bathroom floor. this led to the floor being wet all the time
the hotel is nicely located but it was uphill all the way there which was annoying,

very fresh. nice people working there. good price and close to almost everything",positive
"Reception asked multiple times for the booking confirmation because of problems with booking.com. Even called me after the stay. Very unprofessional.,

Very comfy chair. :)",positive
"Initially we were placed in a room with broken air conditioning, the unit dripped directly onto the bed. It was obvious they were aware as there was an extra fan in the room.  We we called the front desk they did move us but initially threatened that if we moved that night we would just have to move rooms the next day. In the end we were able to keep our new room but it could have been handled better by the staff",negative
a little dust on the table,positive
"Paying for on-street parking outside was a bit of a faff as the hotel car park was full. The pillows were not very pleasant (one is a bag of cotton wool, the other a very thick memory foam). They're the only negatives here, everything else was great. ,

New, modern and slightly unique decoration in the building. Really nice. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and presentable. Location is not bad, 10 mins walk from a busier high street, and not far from city center.",positive
"Great location down the street from Friday Market -- walked everywhere.  Apartment as seen in photos, clean, great atmosphere, loved the exposed brick walls, gas fireplace, nice decor, terrace, views of church towers from bedroom windows. Book this apartment if available.",positive
Very spacious and very clean.,positive
"Lacking room facilities , like ware-drop, no fridge , no coffee facility , no vanity items , small room  ,

Great location , calm but central",positive
"Not a fan of the bathroom. Wallpaper looked used and had stains. The shower curtain also had stains. The bathtub and the showerhead were small.,

Location, breakfast, huge and well designed room and hotel, fast check-in and check-out.",positive
"The room interior was fairly poor (since we are talking about a 4 star hotel). The room itself was very dark with a very tiny window (basically no natural light coming in). Furnitures will definitively need a refurbishment.,

The position was great, the hotel was overall clean and friendly staff.",negative
"It really needs to be clean before guests arrive. My husband actually got the hoover from the cleaner and hoovered himself. It’s a shame as that was the only negative but with the amount of dust and dirt it was a big negative.,

Our room type was great for a family. It’s in a great location and has everything you need for great value including a fully stocked kitchen it even had dish washer tablets and paper towels! Super helpful and friendly staff and easy parking.",positive
"Family room for five was generally set up in a nice way due to the bunk bed concept. However, for 5 people and luggage the room was small. Certainly not the place to spend more time than for sleeping and bathroom. The place can have somewhat of a youth hostel feeling, it needs some initiative from the guests to get stuff done.,

Nice hotel concept ""charming concrete"" which generates a quite unique visual identity. Many details (bunk beds for kids with sliding doors etc). The rooftop pool looked quite inviting and also the bar on top is very nice with some view over the city. The staff is friendly and helpful when approached.",positive
We love it !!!,positive
"Rundown and poorly maintained room

Proximity to all important sites",negative
Fantastic nice motel!  Staff super friendly and helpful.  Was very impressed and enjoyed our short stay.,positive
"The location is convenient to metro and in walking distance from city centre, but the neighbourhood is not interesting - few restaurants and no shops except small supermarkets.,

Quirky (Artsy!) decor, nice large rooms with coffee making facilities and safe, very good facilities for working in the room (rarely the case!). Very good breakfast buffet with healthy options.",positive
"No welcome when you came in. We were early,  we asked when we were able to get into our rooms, were told 3 PM. Came back, had to wait 20 minutes to be seen. No welcome. Then told that only one room was available and that the other employee was ""stupid"" to have told us otherwise.  Parking situation was also not explained although it is worth code and away from thehotel. My bathroom smelled funny. On the third night , after it got hotter outside I had to hold my breath to go in there. Smelled like sulphur. It was better in the morning,  but when I asked for a different room, they simply denied that there was a smell although a young woman who went with me to my room initially said she had smelled it before and could smell it now. While we were at breakfast they sent in someone else and then called to tell me that there was no smell. We left two days earlier than planned as I didn't want to inhale whatever it was for two more nights. There are also an untold number of awkward stairs in the hotel which my elderly mother struggled with. I would not recommend this place to anybody.,

Breakfast was good an the breakfast staff was very nice",negative
"Kitchen facility was kind of broken. No towel on Day 1,

Very convincing, close to both of centre and station. Very kind stuff",positive
"The rooms facing the main road and down the side were noisy from traffic, people but, above all, from several trams that only stop for a few hours at night and that ring a bell as they go up and down the road. 
The hotel was very busy and the pool and bar area were often too busy for their own good. The pool is a lovely touch but so small as to be little more than a place to cool down if really hot. 
One staff member contradicted me several times when I mentioned our room was noisy, even asking me why I thought the rooms at the back would be quieter (p.s. we moved to one on the second night and they were quieter, by a long shot!) She also told me that the endless and louder than loud trams were just 'the normal noise of a city' and generally talked back at me as if I were an annoyance instead of a paying customer. Having just had to pay upfront for our room, I didn't appreciate this at all.
Breakfast was ok but not impressive and the staff was unhelpful. You fry your own eggs on a hot plate. Very odd 
Some rooms were hot. There is no air con but you get a fan. In some rooms the windows don't open. ,

The vibe was cool and the retro design in the rooms well done. The pool, though small, is a nice touch and the area around and it and panoramic bar upstairs are genuinely pleasant. 
The beds were comfortable and the showers were excellent. 
The location was good and well connected.
The coffee was good though if you want hot milk you have to heat your own milk on the coffee machine using the steamer (don't expect the staff to help).
One of the receptionists was very nice and helped us change room very efficiently",negative
"There is a small elevator, helpful for luggage, but large suitcases don't fit so these need to be carried up steep stairs.,

Apartment is spacious, lovely, and perfectly located. There is a well equipped kitchen, which our host equipped with coffee, tea, and a bottle of wine. Balcony with table great in warm weather. Highly recommended.",positive
"Do not stay here! Unless your young without children and plan drink and party all night long. This hotel sits on top of a pub and its the loudest hotel I have ever stayed at in Europe. Yelling and screaming until 3am every night. The hotel itself is old and rundown. Our bathroom shower was in a different room than the toilet. ,

We liked the closed proximity to city center but that’s all this hotel has going for it.",negative
"I needed to work in my room, but there was only a small desk with an ottoman. No actual chairs available. Also WIFI wasn't too great.,

Great hotel with lovely atmosphere. Rooms are somewhat small, but clean and comfortable. Hotelbar offers a wide selection of affordable drinks.",positive

"The bead. Ok ,

The Coffee machine and the tv.",positive
"It was too warm in the room for 4 people. There was no aircondition and the fan offered was too small. ,

We went there for weekend holiday and it was very nice place to stay. Although the swimming pool is a little bit small, my children still like it and enjoyed a lot. Breakfast was basic, not too many options though. Staffs were friendly and the place is very clean. In general for 3 stars hotel, it is quite good.",positive
"A beautifully appointed, spacious and comfortable appartment in the city centre. We thoroughly enjoyed or weekend in Ghent.",positive
"Very dated, run down and not clean.   After 3 months of being closed, hotel was not ready to open.  Price was very reasonable though.  ,

Location- great for Brussels,clean,comfortable room and bathroom, exellent WIFI, very good breakfast.",positive

"Super location, excellent location in Brussels, excellent value for money. Our room was super clean but small. However,  for a three-star hotel, it really exceeded our expectations.",positive
"It was rather expensive but that may be par for the course in Brussels. I personally found the room decor dark and industrial but that presumably was the point.,

Breakfast was exceptionally good. There was a great variety of choice as well as dairy alternatives. Likewise in the evening the restaurant provided good choice of freshly cooked food. The staff were very helpful. The location was terrific, close to the Botanic Gardens as well as transport hubs.",positive
"For family with 2 kids  the room offered should have as minimum one more bed. Somehow they think 2 parents and 2 kids can squeeze in double bed and  small sofa which may be good length for my 3 years old and who may fell out of there at night. But with extra blankets and pillows we somehow manage it twice :D otherwise all perfect and would stay again :),

Excellent location, clean, friendly staff, have kitchen, coffee maker, kettle in room. Perfect.",positive
"A lot of dust in the pillows and the games room was closed but apart from that, it was fine,

Staff very helpful",positive
"Workers banging away past 9 p.m. Very poor mattress, springs at edge of mattress so far gone I fell out of bed. Breakfast supposed to be available from 7.30 a.m. but kitchen staff did not arrive until 7.30 a.m.,

Not a lot",negative

Beds amazing",positive
all good,positive
"The atmosphere was very pleasant, nice design and space of the hotel. All in all a good stay during this week.",positive
"Not so good: not directly in town, but you can see the location of the hotel, so you can decide yourself - value for money was great though,

Awesome breakfast (I think the best we ever had),friendly staff, clean rooms, nice view (from 8th floor), WiFi was ok, overall a great experience",positive
"Little table space in kitchen!,

Good location...spacious! Close to public transport...3 min walk! Supermarket 5 min away!",positive
"Breakfast option was expensive so we chose not to eat there but other than that we were satisfied. ,

It was modern industrial and just had a really cool vibe. My daughter loved sleeping in the top bunk and having little slider doors to close herself away.",positive
"They make you check out before 12 which is really annoying.,

Great location, very helpful and friendly staff and a pretty awesome lounge. The rooms are very clean and comfortable",positive
"The bathroom needs to be updated, especially the bathtub , the bathtub curtain and the towels. The pillows were not comfy and the room was a bit noisy (you could hear noise from the street and people passing inside the corridor). The waffles and the donuts were a bit disappointing. Overall a very nice hotel, but not the best value for money, especially if you factor the parking as part of your stay cost.,

We loved the location - it was apx 15-20  minutes walking from the city center, next to  supermarkets and restaurants.The room is very spacious. It is designed in a very simple and minimalist way  but has all you need. Breakfast selection was very good, though we were disappointed with the waffle wagon and the eggs station, but maybe our expectations were a little bit too high. The staff is very attentive and helpful. We also liked the gym.",positive
"The balcony door was off the hinges and could not be used.  There is no cleaning service, so after the first couple of days we definitely were ready for the bathroom to be Cleaned and for new coffee supplies and clean mugs.   There was basically only coffee the first day, and whilst you could go up and get tp and clean towels there was no pick up of garbage, wet dirty towels or used coffee mugs so by the end of our 4 day stay we were in a bit of a mess.,

Our room was lovely and bright, and the location was excellent!",positive
"Well located close to park, center and transportation, clean and modern space",positive
"There were no slippers, bathrobe or toiletries in the room on Wednesday or Thursday,

Super location !!!!,positive
"Apartment 6 is roomy and is two level with bedroom upstairs.  Take note that the stairs are steep.  Fine for us but not for some.,

Location in Kemmel is very good for hiking in general and for visiting World War 1 sites.  Apartment is very near to town square and its restaurants and has a grocery. Old church yard and several WWI sites are also within short walking distances.    Many restaurants are within a short drive as well as many beer breweries.  Apartment was very clean and spacious.  Parking on the street is pretty easy and accessible and possible on site depending on capacity.",positive
"The second bed was not comfortable. There was no iron. Sometimes we could hear the tenants of the building, and the dog of the tenants which was friendly came into the house when we left the patio door opened for some minutes.,

This house is located in a very quiet and beautiful neighborhood of Brussels, near to a tram station that takes you to the city center in ten minutes. The house was beautifully decorated and you could buy whatever you liked, since every object of the house was for sale. The layout of the house and the garden was very convenient. The twin bed was comfortable and there was hot water in the shower at all times. The kitchen was well equipped and the bathroom had everything we needed. It is perfect for a couple.",positive
"My room smelt of cigarette when we open to walk in.,

The room was big and spacious. The bed was big as well.The breakfast was good and refilled when we asked.",positive
"It was perfect :),

It’s a beautiful apartment with a super comfy bed, amazing shower and great kitchen. Unfortunately it was too cold to enjoy the balcony, so we’ll have to come back :) 
It felt really comfortable, just like being at home. 
Micheline is a lovely host, she gave us a warm, friendly welcome and showed us all the goodies she got us for breakfast.",positive
"The first morning there was no hot water and the drain in the shower was blocked but the host came and fixed the problems within a few hours.,

Lots of space, perfect location, host was quick to fix problem in bathroom",positive
"The room was very small, really had to manoeuvre around the bathroom. Would choose a bigger room if possible next time.,

We loved the layed-back atmosphere, in spite of corona. The location is charming, rural but a couple of minutes away from the city of Maastricht by bike.",positive
"We could not fault the accommodation, staff or the location.,

Our apartment was beautifully equipped and spotlessly clean and cared for. The staff who we met were friendly, efficient and incredibly helpful throughout our stay, and really made us welcome. The location in Flanders is perfect for touring the beautiful towns of Ieper and Poperinghe, and very close to all of the major Great War museums, battlefields, memorials and places of interest. Kemmel village itself is a beautiful, lively and friendly place, well equipped with places to eat and drink and to buy provisions. We will definitely stay here next time we visit Flanders.",positive
"Leaving,

Everything",positive
"The food was fairly poor quality, for breakfast and for dinner. For dinner I resorted to using food delivery services and I ended up skipping breakfast on my last day,

"The bed and pillow was soft for my taste however everything was clean and I still slept fine ,

Very friendly hosts, well decorated room, quiet at night, very nice breakfast",positive
"There wasn't a place in the bedroom to put a suitcase on.,

As a child I grew in a neighbouring village.  The people at Trilogie were very friendly and helpful.  We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay during our visit. The location at the village of Kemmel, close to a local food shop and restaurants and a visitor centre is ideal.",positive
Parking in the locality was difficult,positive
"The fact that the hotel has been surrounded by other buildings with literally no view of the surroundings, but other buildings.,

The location and comfortable bed. Most hotel mattresses are not good for my back, this was firm and comfortable.",positive
"That I didn’t stay for a year!,

Micheline thought of everything. There isn’t anything missing! Her generosity and attentiveness were overwhelming. I have never seen any apartment that is well equipped as this one. It was 10/10 experience in every way.",positive
Everything is perfect!,positive
"Didn’t sleep too well. A bit noisy on main road . Just need to sort decent pillows. ,

Beautiful place. Great value",positive
"It was very difficult to check in. I waited for the contact person at the place where I was brought by the address given on booking. She was not in time. I didn't know the exact address because it wasn't listed. I was in stress.,

Appartament was comfortably, I liked it.",negative
"Location, parking garage, comfortable bed, good (free) coffee in lounge",positive
"Everything was excellent.,

Super clean. Well stocked fridge on arrival - food and drink plus maps and lots of ideas on where to visit. Also host always available to answer any questions. It is a very large apartment with a fabulous deck and separate laundry room. It is in a hip part of town which is still developing infrastructure but only 10 minutes to the old town and actually the area is a really fun place to stay and much more about locals than tourists.",positive
Nice house with amazing view. Room very comfortable. Delicious breakfast,positive
"Our room was facing the street and it was a bit noisy until late in the night (trams passing by).,

Lovely modern apartments with all mod cons",positive

"Old bathrooms, mediocre water pressure, awkward positioning of the shower head,

Huge family rooms",positive
"Really nice appartement, modern quality furniture, large balcony, safe indoor parking space, tv with lots of channels, great music system. The owner left us some food and drink. Located right at the trendy area of Eilandje. 
Can’t fault it. Serious value for money !",positive
"None,

Clean, perfect location, friendly staff.",positive
"The hotel is on a main road so it’s rather loud due to the streetcar and nightly street cleaning, but heck, you’re in a city, so a bit of street noise is not unusual. Perhaps better windows would do the trick? ,

Location, quirky decor + atmosphere, friendly staff, good breakfast",positive
"Absolutely everything. The house is exceptionally clean, comfortable and a real haven in these testing times. The kitchen is very well equipped and a joy to cook in, no need for restaurants. Beautiful Flemish countryside, not far from the coast, close to the French border.",positive
"staff are not very welcomed they actually just doing their jobs the reception not outstanding i can say, and the bed bugs it was like nightmare they bite me ,

The location was perfect.",negative
"A double bed rather than two singles would have been better but it wasn't really an issue, I'm sure other rooms will have doubles.,

Most wonderful welcome and attention given by the owners. We arrived early and were offered coffee and cake in the garden. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. Throughout our stay the owners were so friendly and helpful as were the other guests, it was such a lovely atmosphere. We felt like we were leaving family when we left. The owners are new and I'm sure they will do very well. It's in a good location for Maastricht as it's just over 3 miles away",positive
"Not much ,

Only booked as Ypres was totally booked out. Very close in a quiet pretty town.  Very modern and clean.  Only 15 minutes to Ypres.",positive
"inaccessability of metro,

Amazingly beautiful apartment with very nice garden and good location near Louisa.  One of the best places I’ve stayed at in Brussels for many years! So much better than a hotel!",positive
"The WiFi signal was very weak. I had to use my hotspot via my cell phone. It was nice to have Netflix or other streaming service on the tv. I would not mims to log on my own pc. Or at least a chrome cast so that I can check it via my phone. Just a suggestion ,

I liked the basic facilities. I did not need more than what was offered.",positive
Outstanding Location!,positive
"Very friendly Host. Large room with very nice bathroom. Clean and warm. Contact with the owner very nice and easy. No problems at all. Coffee, water, shower gel available and free of charge.",positive
"I was forced to ask  twice to remove reservation on my credit card because I paid in cash
Also they forgot to book a taxi
No  slippers in the room
The price was  too high for this hotel ,

Clean and comfort room 
Location was ok for me but you must have on mind that the hotel  is far from the center
It is close to Louisa street and metro station",positive
Perfect place to be....,positive
Great location beside bars & restaurants & just off the main square. Effective blackout curtains.,positive
Owner had many years of running this b&b and it showed. Professional but warm welcome.  Excellent facilities and breakfast. Interesting area as well and I wished I could have stayed a bit longer.,positive

Tranquility",positive
Nice people.  Clean,positive

"That we only booked one night. In hindsight we think atleast 3 is advisable. ,

Beautiful quiet environment, very clean house with everything you could possible need, very friendly hostess and host, modern and well thought of facilities and loads of space outside.",positive
"I wouldn't agree that the apartment has a ""view of the city"". You can see either some boring roof tops on one side or closed shop facades on the other. It was quite difficult to find the right place to park even though directions were explained. We needed an address for the parking space instead of a guide, as it helps to be able to put it into the navigation system.This is no fault of the host or the apartment, but Charleroi is kind of depressing. It's like it's a city that ""has been"" and some Googling afterwards confirmed that we were not the only ones to think so. It's hard to explain, but everything is grey and no one smiles at you. When we had parked the car, some young kids threw around fireworks/maroons; scaring the s... out of us. We actually ordered food by Uber Eats because we didn't want to go out.,

The communication with the host was good. All the details were explained and as late as the day before arrival I had some additional questions and they were answered really quickly by text. When we arrived a friend of the host came and greeted us and helped us up with our luggage and showed us around. It was nice and clean and the beds were made much like in a hotel. The best beds on our 5 day tour of NL/BE actually. The TV had a lot of international channels.",positive
"Nothing,

To be honest the Hotel Staff and location are really excellent, Few minutes walking distance from the main station and few minutes from the sightseeing and all other locations you should visite, Thank you Hotel team",positive
"Everything was beyond expectation, a wonderful stay.,

An exceptional property renovated to high standards. The rooms were furnished with style and careful consideration for comfort....the bed and the luxuriously appointed bathroom a real bonus. Located on a quiet country lane amongst nature. Wonderful opportunity to explore further by bike.",positive
"The front desk staff is very detached, they offer almost no information and the only interaction we had is them giving us the keys, telling us the floor of the room and nothing more. Some might enjoy that  attitude, but it was our first time at the hotel so we had no idea where to go and when to check out or when to take the breakfast, some initial help would be nice.,

The breakfast food was simple yet fresh and tasty. Sadly we didn’t have time to see the game room and the pool, which I am sure are amazing, but we absolutely loved the bar on the top floor - the bar staff was very welcoming and catered to all our needs and requests.",positive
"This is a great rental property, with a kind and helpful host.  The beds are very comfortable, the rooms are spacious, the kitchen is modern and easy to use.  This rental has plenty of charm and comfort to spare!  We were very happy with our choice.",positive

Wonderful hostess ,who had a lot on her  mind ,but was 110%",positive

The noise from the apartement above during the night was annoying.,negative
Nice spacious room with all the comforts.,positive
"Everything was perfect!! Everything is new and high quality in this flat. My hope is that our owner will not be put of by unpleasant or dirty guests....,

The owner welcomed us personally. We has a great welcome. We were spending Christmas in Antwerpen. She took great care in decorating all the rooms with  flowers, candles and chocolate it was definitely home away from home!! She gave us all kinds of important and interesting information about Antwerp during Christmas. Really wonderful!",positive

"all things area solid 10!Beautiful facility, great breakfast, nice country location.the host/ owner Bernard could not have been more pleasant, or helpful.Highly recommend.",positive
"The room was a little to small for three people.  The beds were not cozy, they had a single flattened pillow and awful wool blankets draped over the top of the beds.  I’m allergic to wool and felt like I was going to get a rash just from removing the quilt.  The wool quilt felt heavy and dirty.  How does a wool quilt get washed?,

Staff was helpful and polite.  Design style of hotel was fun.",negative
Beautiful house and friendly ouner! Thanks Kristien!,positive

My second time here - it does not disappoint",positive
"The food choice was poor. So poor that I ate only tomato soup for our whole stay. And the prices were extortionate.Although time from ordering to receiving food was very quick.The bathroom although clean hygienically, didn't look it. The bath had stains and the sealant was mouldy.,

I liked the location and the staff. It's a beautiful hotel and the staff made it. Rooms were lovely and spacious and beds very comfy.",positive
"A very clean, large modern open plan apartment with a great view of the cathedral. Facilities were excellent including private secure parking for one vehicle. Micheline met us at the apartment and explained how everything worked, where to go etc and the welcome food package included everything you needed.",positive
"-Odd smell in the lobby (like damp linen)
-Staff only had sparkling water for sale and couldn't offer still when asked,

-Great location

"Really nice small chalet just outside Dinant. By bike it took us 10 minutes to the centre and 30 minutes back, because the chalet is a bit more up. Location is very quiet en surrounded bij trees. The chalet is small, but everything you can think of is there. It has a large balcony with parasol to keep you out of the sun. Bbq is there as well. We really liked it. Veronique is very kind and explained everything.",positive

Great location, exceptionally well maintained property, delicious, fresh and plentiful breakfast. Beer, wine, bikes, hot tub, beautiful patio ... and the nicest owners ever!",positive
"Rooms are small. To put five people in one room is a bit much with the size of the room being what it is. Additionally, the room is positioned on the street side and you can hear the street car and every other noise throughout the day and evening. Definitely not sound proof from the heavy traffic and a very uncomfortable to get a decent nights sleep.,

Good for families that need a short term place to stay",positive

Really nicely decorated apartment, very well equipped and spacious, small enclosed terrace very quirky but lovely for breakfast.  Even had a small air conditioning unit which was very thoughtful. Nespresso machine was great.",positive
"I needed to send any document that needed to be printed to the front desk, rather than having a business center, which would have been helpful.,

Motel One had terrific staff who went above and beyond.  The room was quiet, comfortable, and well designed.  It is in a perfect location for tourists and business travel.  I definitely recommend this hotel.",positive

"It's impossible to find something wrong!,

I've spent from 5th to 9th of July in this amazing b&b: it's set on Belgium country, but at the same time in a strategic position to reach each single corner of Belgium (we drove also to Amsterdam in 2:30 hrs..!). It's an old house completely renovated by Bernard and Martine: ask to them to show a small book with lot of pictures taken during renovation.Every morning breakfast was a pleasure: fresh fruit, home made cake, sweets taken fresh every morning, italian coffee served hot, plus home made marmelades, yoghurt, omelette... the best way to start every sightseeing tour on a city!Rooms are very tidy, with a beautiful bathroom with a giant shower with a view on country side (every morning we saw many rabbits!! so cue!!). Coffe and fresh water are complimentary all day long!In conclusion:  I've never seen a b&b so tidy, familiar and beautiful (with a real affordable price) like this one!Thanks so much to Martine and Bernard!#travelcampamichy",positive
The restaurant has closed down.,negative
Very welcoming and friendly. The property was completely what we required.,positive
"Needed better shower curtain.,

The location is fantastic!  The rooms are small but efficient.  It was clean and the staff is extremely friendly.  The staff could not be nicer.   The breakfast was typical.  The only two issues we had was that the bar next door was very loud very late, but we turned on music and slept well.  And the shower curtain was too small and water leaked all over the floor.  We had a car and parked not far away for 8 euros.",positive
"N/A,

Owners were nice and welcoming and friendly and spoke very good English. We were late getting to the b and b but with a quick email they were very happy to accommodate waiting up for us to get to them.

VERY polite and helpful staff. Room was of standard size, in a warm, ""classical"" style. Very nice lobby bar. They have also a nice SPA zone, however I did not use it. Excellent location in central Minsk - near to most important places and institutions. Comfortable big bed. Room was clean.",positive

Nice location! Very close to restaurants! Nice and comfy rooms.",positive
"Some issues with heating and hot water upon arrival but the staff managed to help fix this, loose door handles and latches, steep stairs, the apartment can use some renewing. ,

Spacy rooms, comfortable beds, satisfying kitchen equipment, very quit, nicely situated in the 'never-go-there' city.",negative
"The private parking behind the hotel was very expensive. 36 euros for 48 hrs. More options for breakfast would have been good. We decided to have breakfast elsewhere as it was a bit limited. ,

The house is in the beautiful green countryside and you can enjoy walking or biking. The b&b has been totally renewed according with the architectural local heritage: it's very pleasant like being at home, beds are super comfortable , rooms are spacious clean and full equipped . Breakfast is delicious, generous, genuine and very healthy with homemade jams , granola and cakes:)We would suggest any friend to spend some days over there!!! Thank you Bernard and Martine🍀",positive
"When I arrived there was one out of the two elevators out of order without any indication while the staff was aware of it. Since this not-working elevator was at the ground floor the problem was that it was impossible to call the other one. Hence, one had to take the stairs or wait forever. Another problem was that there was only one person at the desk and when checking out somebody else abused the person as a travel agency. Again, one had to wait longer than average.Quite some noise from the busy street when having a room at first floor.,

Spacious bathroom. Good breakfast with better than average selection of juices and jam - that's in the name of the hotel ;-)",positive

"There was only one kitchen knife (a serrated bread knife), luckily we brought our own.  Very few basic essentials  (e.g. salt, pepper, oil, toilet paper) present so you must come well prepared or go shopping straight away.  The local shop appears to have closed down so nothing within walking distance.  Lighting and central heating controls a bit fiddly.,

Spacious kitchen and dining area.  Well equipped bathrooms.  Small but cozy lounge area.  Quiet secluded location with a nice garden and outside seating areas.  Comfortable beds and overall spotlessly clean.  Plenty information on local activities.    Nearby Veurne is a surprisingly nice town.  Lovely and well signposted bicycle routes in the area.",positive

"The mix up that started our holiday off on the wrong foot:Because of the overbooking, we were moved to another 'similar' hotel for one night, and then had to return another night. The cost of the other hotel, which was not as new or nice as the Premier Suites, was 299 euro for one night. We would not have gone to Antwerp if we needed to pay this cost per night for a hotel! The hotel staff said that they will try to reimburse us even part of the amount we paid, but I haven't heard anything from them nor seen any reimbursement. As for the hotel itself:There is a distinct unpleasant smell on the 7th floor. A guess would be some kind of sewage. There is a smell that permeates the property that is not very nice. There is a structural issue somewhere.,

The staff were genuinely nice and trying their best to managed the overbooking during the Easter weekend. The property is well cared for and nice. The pool table is a nice feature as well as the small deck. The room was nice, very clean. There were annoying little things in the room that could have been fixed, like a light switch next to the bed wasn't working, etc. But overall it was well appointed and for the most part pleasant. The breakfast includes eggs/bacon as well as yogurt, veggies, coffee, pastries. It's ok. The pastries were not good (seemed refrigerated or not really fresh) and there was limited options for hot meals. But for the cost it was fine.",positive

Spectacular location in the heart of Knokke;The views from the rooftop bar are more then worth the trip.Beautiful hotel reflecting the grandeur of the past. I'm sure that after finalising the renovations this will once again be the place to stay in Knokke. Excellent food and great atmosphere in the seafood restaurant. For fish and seafood lovers a must!",positive
"Only the fact that the cleaning lady asking to do the room before 10am in the morning woke us up,

The bed is great spacious",positive
"The breakfast was very good and probably exceeded our expectation. I was happy with a staple bed for my children (with a side protection). I really like shower and shampoo (from Rituals). This is a nice addition, or even a positive surprise, in a bathroom.",positive

"The night receptionist was not professional,  usually people who work in reception, they are the face of business,  but she was not, I asked her simple question, how long I can park outside in a parking bay, because it was 12:45 midnight,  she was shouting it's not my business.  The morning receptionist wanted to over charge me, because I arrived at 12:45 midnight and was leaving at 11 am she was saying you have to pay for 24 hours, yes I do understand some hotel charge like that, but they have hourly charges and she was saying no, its 24 hours after she talking with someone than she charge me for 11 hours, which is the right way, very disappointing. ,

room was fine",negative
Very dedicated concierge who deeply searching my satisfaction,positive
"The only thing was that the room was for 3-4 persons but only 2 chairs were provided in the room next to the kitchen table.,

The location was perfect-Just a few minutes from the main station. On the 7th floor you'll find the reception and a small restaurant where you can take breakfast, lunch or dinner. The patio outside has the nicest view of the city centre where you can relax. Cleaning is done once every 4-7 days but anything you need is provided for free. The kitchen was really good with all the things you need on a daily basis. Bathroom and room were big with lots of space and storage.",positive

"They did not clarify the breakfast time (should), after asking about the check out. Got to breakfast as 11.10. Breakfast lady, short one, said it was until 11, but we could still have something but only tha basics, bread and coffee or juice. Not wanting to give trouble, had a slice of bread with ham and a small cup of juice, after being told we could not have nothing else. No prices were clarified or even discussed. Was charged 15 euros at the check out, unknowingly. No decent information for the customers, otherwise would have had a decent breakfast for a price bigger than a lunch in some places.,

The room was clean and tiny. Service was good at arrival and lady at check out as well",negative

"When booking the room i actually requested a room with bath and got a response that this will be arranged with no problem. Well, turns out it was not arranged and i didnt get the bath i had been expecting. I also sent and email to the hotel regarding breakfast possibilities in room, but i never got any response. I understand if roomservice is not part of service offered but a response to my email would have been polite. Especially after sending me this ""if you have any questions or request please do not hesitate etc..."",

Good location, trendy decor and the rooftop terrace is really cool! Suits for families too.",positive
"The bell tower is directly beside the hotel so there is never silence. Furthermore the walls are so thin that even without the bells there's never silence. You can here everything you neighbor does. The cleaning hours are really weird, between 15-16 o'clock. That's when I normally want to do little break at the hotel, why do they not clean in the morning? The bed is very uncomfortable because it's too soft. The restaurant is very expensive but very bad. The doors were really weird I was never sure if they were locked.,

The cleaning was ok, the hotel is cheap and you are in the inner city. The breakfast is nice.",negative

Aparthotel Trilogie is an excellent apartment fully furnished and fully equipped kitchen, including a dishwasher.. There is also a lift. It is only 2 floors high but the lift is very handy.

Good location - quiet area and very easy to get into the centre using the tram. 
Rooms very good size.
Great selection for breakfast.",positive
"There are smoking rooms in the hotel and the smoke was coming through the ventilation into my room and particularly into the bath room. Room was quite dark and without reasonable lights. Corridors are also dark. I did not like that security people have been sitting in the corridor during the day.,

Location is perfect. Service at the reception desk was friendly and quick. Good breakfast. Comfortable bed.",positive
"Although parking is available at a great rate right next to the hotel it is height restricted to 1.9m, this should be started on the website.  We asked for a cot in our room and the hotel responded to confirm this was ok but on arrival it was not possible.,

"We are experienced travelers on motorcycles and have stayed in hundreds of hotels all over Europe this past 30years some not so good but mostly all are good. But this place was deceiving at first sight and at reception all looked good. But that’s where it ended. The hall way to the lift was filthy the lift was just as bad and the narrow corridor to the room was littered with cleaners trolleys which we thought was a good thing haha no such luck. The room it’s self must have been there since Noah’s ark and maintained by Bob the builder. Oh and to get to the breakfast area was a challenge get lift to lower floor negotiate a twisty corridor then get another lift to acces the dining area.  Now there’s another story for another day.,

"Its an apartment hotel, they dont clean and make up your room every day. For them to clean your rubbish you need to hang a sign on the door... We put it 3 days they never took the rubbish, at the end we had to ask for a broom to sweep....which we didnt get.  ,

Great location to the central train station and city centre.",positive
"Coffee in the room would be nice. It was pretty sparce; no safe, fridge, water, phone (for wake up calls), tv didn't offer many English stations (I know it's in Belgium, but even one station besides the news all day would be nice). Better food choices in the bar area would encourage more time there. Ham and cheese sandwich and potato chips didn't quite make it that appealing. Fair location.  It's walkable to the center, but I'd prefer to be closer.,

Very quiet room, even though on a busy street. Windows opened for fresh air which was nice. Bar/lounge area was nicely done in the lobby area. Good shower with lots of hot water. Comfortable bed.  Easy to find from the train station.",positive
"Has seen better days (already 10 years ago), needs definitely renovation. (Almost injured my foot due to a broke tile in the bathroom) 
Staff in the seafood restaurant and rooftop was very friendly, rest of staff was medium. ,

Hotel is situated very well, room was spacious and also nicely located.",negative
"I thought the price of breakfast was quite expensive (€22.90 per person), but there are many cafe's nearby so each morning we chose to go out for breakfast instead.  The restaurant was closed at the time of our visit (throughout July and August) so we couldn't eat at the hotel for mealtimes.,

The staff were very friendly.  Myself and my partner had a lovely 3 night stay, room cleaning was offered every day, and tea and coffee making facilities were provided.  The hotel was very quiet with no disruption from other guests.  The lift requires a key card which made me feel a lot more safe and secure in the hotel.  I wouldn't change anything about the experience we had during our stay at NH Brussels Bloom.",positive
"The breakfast was just basic, there could be a greater selection of fruits, yoghurts and cheeses. Also the hotel could provide some local specialties, like waffles or tarts,

The room was comfortable and clean with a working air conditioner. There were tea and coffee making facilities and the toiletries were excellent quality. The shower curtain didn't cling to me either when in the shower so that was a pleasant surprise.
It's reasonably close to the North station and handy if you have a bus or train to catch. It was a bit difficult to find though, especially at night but then it's cheaper than the easier to find options, so you get what you pay for.
There's a Carrefour Express right opposite the hotel.",positive

"For me, the design was too much. The photos in the hotel gallery look much better than reality. I do not mind an industrial style or admitted concrete at all but some grafiti on walls were truly scary. The ride by lift was an absolutely claustrofobic experience.,

Comparing to other hotels, the Jam was an average one. The room was OK, quite large and I particularly liked a large, ellegant bathroom. Breakfast was OK, too. In January, the tea set in the room was a great help.",negative
"There was a delay with the check-in process, but they provide a space for luggage which allowed us to walk around and discover the city while they got it sorted out.,

The location of the hotel was absolutely fantastic. No matter where we were going, we ended up running into it, as it was so central. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and our bed was actually a double and not two twins put together. We didn't have the breakfast, but there are plenty of places around for that.

The location",negative
"Breakfast is crazy expensive per head. Instead walk a couple of blocks past the botanic gardens and to one of the local bakeries or cafes.,

Rooms are clean and functional (although, like most hotel rooms in Europe, don't have enough power outlets for two traveling professionals to charge their electronics). Bed was extremely comfortable. Each room has been designed individually by a local artist - which is charming and quirky.",positive
"None,

The staf are extra friendly and helpful.We booked a room for two and they supply a big extra single bed for our 9 year old child.The location is perfect. The room and bathroom are huge.Great value for money for a 5 stars hotel.You even have a casino inside the hotel.",positive

"BED BUGS in one of the two sleeping areas - nasty!!! Two out of four in our traveling party were bitten by bed bugs all over on face and body.Poor security! The landlord only had a key to the building's exterior entrance available. He had no key to the actual apartment. Allegedly, a previous guest had forgotten to turn the key in, and the landlord did not have time to get a new key made. We were not able to lock the apartment.,

Tram stop within very short walking distance (approx. 2-3 minutes)Landlord lives upstairs in same building, so retrieving keys was easy.",negative

The b&b is great if you are into an aesthetically pleasing location. The other hotels in Bruges tend to be a bit outdated.

We could not recommend it enough and we will certainly go back in the future !",positive

No room service due to covid which I understand but no chance to eat at all if arriving after 9. Good that is dog friendly but +19€ for it for not having even a bowl or anything at all for the dog the room is not nice. ,

Jo is so nice! really enjoy the exprence in Brugges,positive
"Someone used my room number to go to the breakfast in my name. When I have to pay at check-out, I discovered this situation and I was surprised that the hotel does not use an identification way for people using the restaurant for the breakfast. It was not a pleasant moment when I have to say to the reception that I can not pay for something I did not use. The reception should take in account my concern for this situation, as anyone can go in your name and try to get in your room asking for a key.,

Did not have time for the breakfast. But the hotel looks good.",positive

Breakfast was excellent, although for 25EUR how much they charge, it should be. The park nearby is magnificent.",positive
"The host of this accommodation is just perfect. My workers was really happy to live in De Waterkriek. I recommend this accommodation not only for work travels but also for holiday stays. Place is really calm and family friendly. I do not put a lot of accommodations to my favorite list, but this one is on the top of it! I wish there were more hosts like Mrs Hilde.",positive

Breakfast is very good: a lot of choice (bread, viennoiseries, juice, fruits....), brought at your door according to the time you have requested",positive
"Paper coffee filters should be included if coffee maker requires them.One single roll of toilet paper is a bit stingy.,

Excellent location, helpful, amenable staff, comfortable rooms, fair price",positive
"WiFi conditions are not good. My computer and iPhone could catch the WiFi, but could not go out to internet by unknown reason. I used a prepaid SIM instead. That is an additional cost.,

Good position, near by city centre, clean, value for money, nice welcome",positive
"Not a problem for me as I'm Flemish of origin, but the owners are Flemish and speak only basic French and English. They will definitely do their best to understand you so in the end all will be OK, but it might take some more time to understand each other.,

Very welcoming and friendly people. They regularly checked up on us to see if we had everything we needed.The area is amazing for long walks in the forest, next to rivers and along the hills.Definitely recommended",positive

Location",positive
"Everything was clean, new, cute and the staff amazing. We loved. The only point is that is not that close to the beach, but it’s close to the market and so nice. We had a wonderful time and look forward to come back! (They were so nice to let our pug to stay with us)",positive

The breakfast was excellent!",positive
"Room is little bit smaller, however still nice and light with very good bathroom.,

My stay in Motel One was lovely. Very close to the center and also to the train station. If you compare the price in very cheap hostels around center (with very low quality, old or bad service) - this is the great deal for this money. I will definitely stay in Motel One next time.",positive

Very comfortable clean room with an amazing view",positive

Very welcoming and helpful staff.",positive
"Jo could not have done enough for us, he met us at the station in Brugge & listened to what we wanted to do whilst we were in Brugge. Once at his place he made us a coffee & then drew us a scenic route to take to see the best of the city and pointed out the best places we would enjoy visiting based on what we said we wanted to see.The location was perfect, a short walk from the station and into town. We took the scenic route down the canal opposite to walk into town, which took a little longer but we managed to view a lot of the sights before hitting the Christmas Markets. We stayed in the L Suite and the room was truly stunning, Jo is an interior designer and he has styled some amazing rooms. The handmade bath was beautiful & so relaxing- hands down one of the most luxurious rooms we have stayed in. The beds were also super comfy & the place was extremely clean.We can't recommend Kind of OJ enough, if you are thinking of booking, you will not be disappointed!",positive

Check in and check out is very slow. But breakfast was out of this world!!,positive
"The location was a bit off-putting at first  squeezed in along a main road, some distance from the centre of Knokke and the beach. Once inside the bungalow it was very cosy, though at a busier time of year it may be difficult to get some privacy as they are very close together.,

Small but comfortable and well appointed bungalow, very clean. Good breakfast, friendly and helpful staff.",positive

Able to park right outside. (Charged). Close to centre. It was hot and although no air con a fan was provided.",positive
"The room and en-suite was very small. The bed was uncomfortable, mattress very soft and felt more like a water bed. Hotel very tired in decor and furniture. The breakfast was quite poor. The fresh meats and cheese were good but the bread rolls and croissants were a bit stale. ( croissants only available at weekends!). Limited selection of breakfast foods. Both restaurants in the hotel were closed during our stay. We also had a problem with the door lock. Our room key wouldn’t let us in, and once inside we couldn’t get out. It took a man almost two hours to fix it while we were waiting to go out. We were a little disappointed with our experience at this particular hotel.,

The location of the hotel was very good, just about 50 meters from the main market square. On arrival the lady on reception was pleasant and helpful.",negative
"Expensive!,

Breakfast was excellent, super friendly staff",positive
"Breakfast. Bog standard.i had two bread rolls in one morning out of five stayed.The other morning I just went down to get a coffee and was interrogated by a staff member asking for my room and how long I was with the motel. No air-conditioning in the rooms, no vending machines, no ice machines, room was quite small (I had to move furniture to open window etc. Toilet door self closing, my shower head kept leaking (room 770), tv in an awkward position in relation to the bed.,

The staff and location. That's all.",positive
"The bathroom definitely didn't look like on the pictures and needs renovation. It would be nice to add kitchen towels and soap in the kitchen, especially with corona it would give the guests a safer and cleaner feeling. The balcony war dirty.,

The central location is good, very close to the beautiful station, shops and restaurants are in walking distance and the street is very quite. Also, I like the modern style of the property and the staff is friendly. The Nespresso Coffee and tea were a nice touch in the room.",negative

"Nothing to dislike. 
,

Very friendly welcome to a lovely home. Nothing was too much trouble. Bed was really comfortable and the breakfast superb. Drinks bar open on a honestly basis and refreshed regularly. Would definitely stay again if in the area. Surrounding roads ideal for motorcyclists who enjoy quiet bendy routes down to little villages. Open all year round.",positive
"The hotel is in a perculiar location. Moving into the botanical gardens next door is delightful. Crossing the road into the back streets maybe less so as there was rubbish piled up on the street. At no point did I feel unsafe though, even late at night. More an oddity than a problem.,

I had arranged a different hotel in Brussels for my stay but refused my booking on arrival due to an overpowering smell. NH not only took my booking at midnight, they also did not seek to charge an unfair last minute price. My stay was delightful. I would return next time I am in town.",positive
"The play ground for the kids is small ,

The location was top, we stayed at a bungalow with 2 little kids. The bungalow was small but cute. Each room had it’s own shower & toilet which was a big plus. We stayed in March, the weather didn’t allow us to enjoy the terras & the garden. I think in the summer it’s a great place for families to stay.",positive
"Loved the property. Travel hassle free, they have everything you need. I travelled with my family that included two young boys (4 and 9 years). They stay was comfortable and right in the middle of all the action (Grand Place). Don’t think too much and go for it.",positive

Nice hotel, great location on the beach, good restaurant (just imposed  dinner menu but very good)  and excellent breakfast. Spacious rooms, lots of storage place",positive
"It is a huge Hotel with a lot of guests and I feel the breakfast is a bit overcrowded.,

Excellent value for money: the Hotel is easy to reach, less than 5minutes walking from the underground station. The check in and check out are very easy and quick. Rooms are not very big, but quite comfortable and clean.",positive

Well located if you travel by train or fly to Antwerp.,positive
Everything was very clean and well organised to deal with the current rules.,positive
"If I was being picky, I do love a cup of coffee when I wake up and there wasn’t any coffee making facilities in the room. This is by no means a criticism as Jo did say to ask if we wanted anything, I would have felt a little guilty though asking so early.,

Jo was such a welcoming host and the whole experience was completely unique. From the individually made clay bath and sinks to the bespoke tables and chairs, truly wonderful! All topped off by a truly sumptuous breakfast - I cannot put into words exactly how good the smoked salmon and avocado on toast was! Jo also gave us a very detailed map of Bruges and marked all the best places to eat, visit and the best walking routes which was invaluable. We cannot wIt to go back!",positive

"Surprisingly, you cannot order any food or room service at certain times, they have special opening hours of a restaurant/bar, which was a bit inconvenient.,

Rooms were very spacious, interesting interior designs and good breakfast. Located in more or less business area, 10 minute walk from the center and north station.",positive
"Can’t think of anything...,

The bungalows are very cosy, neat and well maintained. It has everything you need. Usually these sorts of places are worn down and they tend to disappoint, but this place is excellent!",positive

Overall, a stay in KOOJ is an amazing experience and we would definitely recommend.",positive

Everything",positive
I had a room looking at St.Catherine square. It was very loud outside until 2:30 every night,positive
"The bathroom was at the corner of the room, without any separation, and it did not include a bathroom sink.,

The closeness to the train station and the fact. The kitchen was fully equipped and included coffee, tea and spices and salt, which are always useful.",positive
"Complete disaster:
1. Roof terrace is pretty much inaccessible to guests of the hotel, because most of the time
Is booked for private parties.
2. Staff is incredibly rude and lies when you try to complain. They don’t listen when you try to suggest an Improvement of the services.
3. Nowhere is stated that the roof terrace is not a privilege for the guests of the hotel. This is ok, but if one of your choices for the hotel is the roof terrace with nice view, don’t fool yourself, because probably you will not be able to reach it.
4. Rooms are not clean, they are dark, depressive and dont look like on the photos.

Only the location.",negative

Very clean room. Very friendly personel. Excellent bar for cofee, drinks and snacks! Very cose to the Metro and to the most important museums.",positive
Staff,positive
"Would have been a 10/10 but for the fact that booking.com charged the rate including all taxes, then the hotel insisted that they also had to charge city tax, despite my invoice stating taxes are included in the rate I paid. They blame booking.com but as far as I'm concerned I've paid it twice. Not a lot as only a one night stay, but what if it had been a week? 
Need to get it sorted. ,

Great rooms. Good staff. Helpful reception. Good food served in the restaurant. Everything above and beyond expectations for the rate charged.",positive
"Too much light, maybe thicker curtains,

Super nice staff!",positive
"The room was uniquely decorated; the common spaces felt like being in a gallery or a museum; all details were carefully thought of; the breakfast was incredible (fresh fruit, salmon avocado toast, confectionary, all served artistically). Our host was exceptionally hospitable.",positive

location and cleanliness,  perfect amenities and facilities for our busy schedule as trade exhibitor and meeting with our clients. quick & efficiency hotel's taxi services :)",positive

The restaurant was the best thing about the hotel!",negative
"The bad smell in the corridor between the elevator and the room, the weak light in the barthroom, the dust accumulated in the aerators in the roof of the bathroom, the armchair and the sofa looked without housekeeping since a while, the cost of 300euro for 1 night and 3 people (with breakfast and car parking) considering the hotel looks a 3 stars hotel and not 4. Never received the dinner menu offers in the previous days despite asked it by email twice, so at the end we couldn't have a table for the dinner because too late with the booking. ,

The position, the area of the breakfast and the kindness of the owner.",negative
"Spacious and clean room.
Professional staff",positive
"Floors in the room were sticky with dirt, noise from room above was very loud, sheets had stains on them, bathroom had two useless soap dispensers (one empty, another mounted so close under the counter it was impossible to use), the lift area to reception on 7th floor is smelly,

Nice idea though poorly executed - good size room if with family",negative
"that i had to pay for parking and that i didnt get free water in hotel every day as i was there for 10 nights. i had to remind cleaner i wanted milk every day and not just when they wanted to leave me milk,

That i could park my van, which was little expensive. I think if you stay in hotel it should come with free parkingStaff were excellentgreat beergood food",positive
"Minor thing, the ventilation system automatically turns off every few hours. likely a centralized function.,

We had a very warm welcome from the front desk team. The room was spacious, comfortable and well ventilated. The food service is well organized. The parking is in front of the hotel. We have been twice to this property and will certainly be back.",positive
"Location a bit far from center,  heating wasn't very good, no tissue box inside the room,

Friendly staff, Nice Design, quiet, next to the lake for a nice walk",positive
"We read about breakfast being too expensive, so we decided not to book breakfast, and I would recommend the same to others. It just seems to be too expensive, €18,50 per person. Also, the parking should be free of charge (hotel is currently charging €15,00 per day), as the hotel is not located in an overcrowded area and free parking is available nearby.,

This property is a nicely furnished hotel in Berchem, a southern district of Antwerp. We booked Deluxe King Room. We needed a place to overnight, and found this nice accommodation perfect for that. Antwerp Expo is just a few minutes away by foot. Public transportation is close to the hotel, and you can easily reach Antwerp city center by tram. The staff was very friendly and willing to help. When we arrived to the hotel room, we didn't find any bathroom towels there, but the receptionist handled the problem in no time. We got our towels immediately. The room was spacious and wifi worked great.",positive

"Cottage was clean, warm and comfortable. Breakfast brought to door at 9 am, it was very tasty.",positive
"The pillows were a bit flat (but they gave us extras after asking) and there was no housekeeping but this is clearly stated as a self contained apartment so we didn’t mind! ,

Absolutely loved our stay here! It was actually a perfect location! On a square with loads of lovely restaurants, loads of good bars on the next street and a 5-10 min walk into the old town and main sights! Staff were really friendly and helpful, room was clean and comfortable, amenities were provided with extras if you asked for them! Great value for money!

The room was spacious, and had a kitchen, which was nice because we wanted to prepare our own food. The hotel is close to the train station.",positive
"Everything was perfect. It has a closed parking. The rooms are big enough, the restaurant has a great selection of food. We spent one night and it was all great.",positive
"Staff bit stressed (too few of them)
Food service for breakfast had to be collected on tiny trays to bring upstairs to your room. They could have been sturdier and larger. 
A bit pricy for what you get in current times but at the same time you are keeping them and their employees in business...,

The hotel is quite new with only 3 years since opening in a gentrified area around the train station. 
Close-by the old city center
Clean rooms with a nice bathroom with walk in shower. No noise issue from street or trains and parking lot next door. 
Food service in covid times was handled well with room service for dinner and served buffet for breakfast",positive

This is nice hotel and walking less than 10 minutes walk to Brussels centre. Staff are very friendly and helpful. we got our room very earlier than check in time for no cost which was great. Clean and tidy.",positive
"Room not totally clean - dust and dirt inside the wardrobe (obviously not swept / vacuumed for some time); one of the coffee cups provided had not been washed thoroughly; surfaces dusty (i.e. around and underneath coffee machine); water standing in both kettle and coffee machine (not sure whether filled for our benefit or left by previous occupants, therefore better for both to be empty to avoid confusion); our room was not cleaned during our stay and when we asked for our coffee pods to be replenished, we were advised there was a charge - it seems disingenuous to advertise a coffee machine as a feature and attraction of the room, but then not offer guests free pods do that they can use the machine throughout their stay; shower gel receptacle empty and hand wash receptacle virtually empty - better to remove these altogether if you only want guests to use the mini toiletries provided. Lighting in the room inadequate - series of lamps controlled by individual switches, no main switch to activate all lights and not enough light in sleeping area, not ideal in dark January!,

Excellent location; spacious room; large, comfortable bed",negative
Nice room. Next to train station. Modern and cozy atmosphere!,positive
Very comfortable beds and the best bath in any hotel I’ve stayed in. Easy to walk into town from here and very cheap parking. Staff are always so helpful and friendly. Enjoyed the option to have breakfast and evening meal in my room. I’m so glad my favourite hotel is open again!,positive
"We thought that breakfast was included,

All good",positive
"Powdered milk for the coffee in the room,

Own made waffle in the breakfast",positive
"Weather was OK. There was only local television. No international channels, for example no news in English or German.Price for a longer stay too high, more than 200 dollar or swiss franks per night. Otherwise good value.,

Good breakfast fresh coffee, which was delivered at the time as we liked to have it in the morning.2 Bathrooms, bed was good too, 2 showers, hot water and good heating.",positive
"Nothing,

Clean and tea machine",positive
"Two main things: I left a pair of my favourite jeans in the room, called an hour later, was told to call in the afternoon, and then called, came in and apparently the jeans ""were never found"". Well, since jeans do not yet walk by themselves, if I did not take them, somebody else must have. So that's quite disappointing for a hotel these days. Has not happened to me in a very long time. Another one is less of a hotel fault, but since there was a question on area/security, i think it is quite important. We parked our car right next to the hotel, between two nice cafes even. Overnight the car windows were broken, car opened, and quite a few things stolen from the car (we just moved to Belgium, our first night there, so could not empty the car fully obviously).,

Quite popsy modern hotel with a nice bar and interesting design.",negative
I was a bit sceptical about both the hotel and the Brugge Xmas market! Unfortunately both had received several negative reviews on another site. Personally both hotel and market were great. Hotel was not 5 star and didn’t purport to be. It was clean comfortable and in a great location. No hesitation in recommending. market was an Xmas market and delivered on that. Lots of shopping in surrounding streets. If you love beer and chocolate book today!,positive
The view onto the beach while having breakfast is beautiful.,positive
"The double room was very small and only really appropriate for one person, with no space for the luggage which had to take up some of the limited floor area, also no coffee maker in the room. Also unable to control the temperature in the room, apparently none of the room heat/AC controls function,

Bed was comfortable, good shower, good location, short walk to Central station and all the sights, minimarket across the street.",positive
"When we were checked in staff didn't pay any attention to us for a while, it wasn't kind of that you are expecting usually. In the room was a really bad sewer smell, we were there just for a couple of nights so decided not to complain,

Location! Next to the railway station, a lot of the restaurants nearby, walking distance to the city center. Big and clean room, the extra sofa was really helpful (we were traveling with a 5yo). Fresh coffee in the room.",positive
Bed was a bit hard,positive

All in all in was okay!

"old lobby and old carpets and partially old furniture.,

easy parking in the Hotel Garage. friendly staff at the bar, late dinner possible. Rooms nicely equiped and newly renovated.",positive
"At earlier occasions I was surprised by the price of the breakfast, which can add a considerable amount to your bill if you are not aware of it - this time I made sure breakfast was included in my reservation.,

Interior and overall atmosphere of the hotel is very good. The room was spacious, clean, and nicely designed. The bed was comfortable. Working area was large enough - wifi worked without problems. Coffee machine with coffee and tea in the room. The bathroom is large enough, clean, and has nice design as well. Breakfast has high quality selection and ample choice. The location is off-centre but for my travel purpose close enough to my work destination within Brussels. Short walk from Noord-station.",positive
We just loved everything about our stay. Would most definitely return and recommend to others.,positive
"There was no hot water on the last day, that was a bit disappointing but we were leaving anyways. ,

We liked everything else. For the 1st time we travelled with a baby so it was nice having a little kitchen in the room and it was clean and all the equipment were also clean.",positive

"Maybe a kettle but good value for money.,

Bed was extremely comfy couldn't fault it one bit.",positive
"The information given on booking.com is VERY misleading. It says the hotel opened in 2018- this IS NOT a new place. In fact, the apartment was very tired-looking: dirty grit and sealant, broken towel rail in the bathroom; blocked drain in the bathtub (standing in water way above your ankles when taking a shower is not a pleasant experience!) and the toilet filled up with water every time you flushed it. Also, on the list of the room facilities there are a few things, which simply are not available in the room: dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer (although washing facilities are available in the hotel), NO BIN in the kitchenette. The Elemis toiletries were a great treat, but we were provided with 30ml bottles of each product (shower gel, body lotion, shampoo and conditioner) for 4 people. The two big dispensers by the washbasin and bathtub were empty and looked like they were never filled up. The kettle was dusty and RUSTY inside! I had to give it a good scrub before being able to use it.I'm not sure what the hotel means by 'hypoallergenic' but feather pillows and dusty surfaces gave us all runny noses! Lastly, the car park. On the website it says: Public parking is available at a location nearby (reservation is not needed) and costs EUR 13.50 per day. However, only when you ASK about the parking, the receptionist will give you a EUR 5 voucher. We went to speak to the shift manager to let him know about the bathtub and the missing bin, he apologised and...it never got sorted. Very, VERY disappointing.,

The location is perfect for sightseeing and shopping. Elemis toiletries.",negative

"The breakfast is not comparable to any of my previous NH experiences. Good bread, but no smoked salmon, not many cooked options... not really worth",positive
Excellent chalet with great facilities.  So much crammed in to the chalet it was excellent use of space and made things terrific for us.,positive

Central location the rooms were studio style ideal for cooking quick dinners as we are travelling to a budget this spas ideal. Staff very friendly and helpful.",positive
"We choose this hotel because it was rated really good. We assumed it will be really clean during corona, but it wasn’t (look at the pictures). Also there is NO AIR CONDITION!!!! We had one little fan for the whole room. The room was also super small. The Pool was very crowded and nobody was wearing a mask at the pool side. The Rooftop Bar was also super full and there is no AC either. We are really sorry that we have to complain about that, but it was really just a disappointment...",negative
"Not a long enough visit,

Good bed and breakfast well positioned for town centre",positive
"Nothing.,

Very nice interiors, all modern and renewed. The staff was overall nice, the breakfast various: all food fresh and delicious. I would have liked some more choice in the salty part (e.g. more types of ham & cheese), but not that big matter. All tasted good and was refilled continuosly and kept in order by the staff. The bed was comfortable, room and common spaces always clean. Easy check in-out. Very close to the city center and to a park. I loved the lounge and the bar nearby! What would make this hotel even more close to perfection would be a gym/sauna...I really missed a fitness & wellness area in a nice place like that! Despite this, for sure with pleasure again in Motel One, five stars anyway ;).",positive

"Location: Quite far from the city center and quite in the middle of nowhere. Antwerp has a nice old city but it is quite small regarding to the metropole. The Hotel is located in the border of the metropole so you need to go through a quite ugly part of the city to reach the old city centrum; The car parking is very small: we didn't succeed to find a place there and very hard to find a slot in the area.,

Very comfortable hotel although a little old (still carpet and old furniture and old colors). An amazing choice for the breakfast (although very expensive). Very nice service with a very friendly and helpful staff.",positive

"Room smelt musty, bathroom sink smelt of sewage, bar at the rear noisy till 3am, double bed was two singles pushed together so slumped in the middle, Wifi was very hit and miss if it was working and room was covered in dust, also found hair in the bed.

"Nothing.,

The Hotel is newly built, was really trendy. Very happy with the hospitality.",positive
"This is NOT the fault of the staff, but a rookie mistake on my part. My partner and I decided to go to Bruges on the first weekend of Lockdown because travelling is still allowed in Belgium. We knew it would be quiet but we were okay with walking, driving, getting takeout meals, and seeing the sights. Unfortunately, we booked through Booking.com and chose the ""excellent breakfast included"" option, as it is slightly cheaper than paying once you've arrived. We didn't know that the kitchen/restaurant would be completely closed (that, in fact, the hotel itself would be closing on the day of our departure) and that room service would not be an option. Bagged breakfasts were provided, and while they had a variety of cold items (pastries, yogurt, fruit, juice, water), it was not worth spending 17+ euros per person per breakfast. I have learned my lesson not to pre-book breakfast but to buy it, if available, on a day-to-day basis. However, I commend the staff for a well-organized layout, easy access to hot tea and a variety of coffee drinks throughout the day, and real plates and cutlery available for guests to use at breakfast or for their takeout meals.,

Very clean; friendly staff; modern amenitiesIt's helpful to know that this hotel is slightly outside of town, and the views aren't much - buildings and a parking lot. However, once you get out of the parking lot and across the street, you are surrounded by the gorgeous scenery of Bruges. It may take 10-15 minutes to walk to the Markt (main square) area, but within two minutes of leaving, you will find that the walk is completely charming!",positive

"Cons- The roof-top bar was booked-out so we could not visit it.- The pool hours only went until 1900, and most hotel guests would be out and about during that time.,

Pros- The room was a great price and large! Our room had a nice view of the street below, was spacious, included an air cooler (!!) that worked very well, and was cute. - The location was not as close as some other hotels might have been to the center of town, but it was near many stores and tram stops. This still made it very easy to travel around the city.- The hotel had a bar/restaurant inside and a pool.- Parking was only $15/day and was directly next to the hotel--very convenient. - There is a cat cafe (!) literally right next door for anyone else who loves cats.",positive
"The rooms were out dated.  The toilet was separate from the washing facilities so you had to walk through the entire apartment to wash your hands. This might be standard for the area, so this may be a moot point.   Our hair dryer was broken and when I asked to have it fixed they told me to go to the lobby to borrow one they had at the front desk.  No one bothered to fix it.  The lobby was locked at breakfast time and I didn't have my key before I was to leave for work (left it in my room for my family).  Would've been nice to be informed of this upon check in.,

Everything was excellent! Good location around the corner from the station and close to Meir. Comfortable penthouse apartment with good shower and bed as well as oven, hob and dishwasher should one wish to self-cater some meals although breakfast, snacks etc. are available for purchase.

"The room was clean, however some of the wall paint was a bit aging. The bath sink was clogged. If you fancy a walk It is a bit uphill from  the historical center (which is walking distance ~20min this is good!). This is not necessarily bad, but nearby (perhaps 3-4 blocks away) there is the red light district, the area however felt safe.,

Room was spacious, lively in nice colors. Bed was OK and pillows were fine. View was excellent,  we could see Atomium. Very good connection to metro and tram. Botanical gardens right next to it. Room had kettle and coffee, chocolatte and tea was refilled daily. Staff was helpful.",positive

"The front desk staff name Martin was shockingly rode and raciest at one point he mentioned to us you should know this is not your country, simply we had questions on check out when we realised they charged us different rate then to our initial booking through Booking.com.
It’s shame for Ramada  to hair this kind of characters.,

Good location,",negative
"Nothing,

The B&B is located centrally in Halle where I was working, it’s close to the shops and restaurants and just across the canal from the train station where you can get trains into central Brussels (15min) and airport (45min). 
Karin is a wonderful host, the breakfasts are delicious, and my room was very clean and comfortable. The B&B only has 5 rooms so there is a nice cosy atmosphere.",positive

everything",positive
"Getting in was a bit hit and miss.,

Bang opposite the station, though there is a canal in the way of the direct route - allow 6 minutes.  For those who don't know it, Halle is a great alternative to staying in Brussels - five trains an hour taking 10-15 minutes and a decent little town.  Les Eleveurs is a superb restaurant and there are numerous decent bars in the centre.  Excellent homey breakfast.",positive
"We had a small issue with collecting our keys upon arrival. The keys were not stored in the place where they were supposed to be, so we had to call the owner and the keys were delivered in 20 minutes. Not a major issue, but I wouldn't like that to happen if we arrived later in the evening.,

The owners are super kind and helpful! Breakfast very good and tasty!

I informed hotel ahead that additional bed is required. They gave me a bed...a cot, baby cot! And thorn duvet with no bedding and pillow for a little one. I was speechles, little one took it on a chin and build herself a tent in a cot. I ""stole"" bedding for her from housekeeping trolleys...she loved it cause she fit and it was 1 night only. There was more ....long story short: I was leaving hotel at 7am...reception was closed! I pushed the emergency exit door to get out...DOOR MARKED AS EMERGENCY EXIT WERE CLOSED! LOCKED! Other, side door were unlocked but realisation that in case of anything....this is a narrow, old, dark building with few floors. There is no safe escape. ,

La Maison de Nathalie is one of the best places we have ever stayed. Nathalie is a wonderful person; she is communicative, helpful and welcoming. Her place is very cosy and clean, the rooms are nicely stylish and there are little very-well thought details in the building which make you feel comfortable instantly. The bed was crazily soft.",positive
"Bar prices too expensive, Breakfast at 24 euros rip off, especially self service, so dined out each day local for breakfast.,

Good Facilities",positive

This place was a real gem! We absolutely loved staying with Francois and Marie. They were amazing hosts and couldn’t have been more helpful. They made us feel at home. Breakfast was truly outstanding! It was a great haven away from a very busy Bruges. Stay there!!!",positive
"There was so much noise! We specifically asked for a silent room and we received the one in front of the elevator, which was making a lot of noise every time it arrived to the floor! We could listen the people in the corridor, and the room just next to ours... We didn't spend a good night at all.,

The bed was perfect.",negative
"A bit of noise from the street, but that is to be expected when you are in the middle of everything.Water pressure in the shower could be better.,

This place is simply beautiful. They made a lot of effort getting it to be this comfortable. Feels like you could just live there. And this location is perfect! Central to everything, loads of restaurants and bars around. I highly recommend this, it is a true hidden gem",positive

It was clean",positive

Breakfast was extremely good and the location could not be better",positive
"Too sensitive motion sensitive lights under the side tables ,

Very helpful and welcoming staff. They kindly offered us a 1/2 bottle of champagne for my companion's birthday and prepared a breakfast tray the day I missed breakfast. The hotel's location is great, walking distance from the beach and Zoute and 10mins drive from the Zwin nature reserve. The hotel has been entirely refurbished and has a contemporary and cosy feel. We had a  very pleasant stay and would recommend Hotel Britannia for its charm, quality and hospitality",positive

"There was a very bright emergency exit sign inside the room that was lit up all night, it was a bit annoying, but manageable! ,

The location was excellent, in the center next to the big markt. The staff was friendly, and the breakfast was good. Overall good experience at this hotel",positive
"It’s clean, nice interior design. Very modern and efficient",positive
"Our room (508) was directly opposite the door to terrace to pool therefore noisy, especially as guests were blaring music on the terrace. Had the feel of more of a hostel rather than a hotel. There was no window in our room so no fresh air, as room backed onto staircase up to the 6th floor to the bar. Due to to this we had no privacy and had to keep the curtain closed. Room then became very dark and dingy and no air circulation. The temperature was highly unpleasant and unbearable. There was a cooling fan in the room but it made absolutely no difference to the temperature in the room and it was very difficult to sleep. Overall it was not a good experience and would not stay here again. Not at all worth the money we paid for the two nights. ,

Room was clean. Bed and pillows were comfy. Terrace with pool was a good option to have but on the other hand only at specific time of day (early morning before the ‘party’). There is a lovely cafe opposite the property which we enjoyed on both mornings.",negative
"I can't honestly think of one negative thing about the place.,

The apartment was spacious, very comfortable and well equipped. Bed was extremely comfortable. Laundry facilities provided free.  Location couldnt have been better.😊",positive
"The stuff were very rude, we stayed for 3 nights no one cleaned the rooms and when we talked with stuff they tends to put the mistakes on us and said we put the sign of not disturbing and that's not true we didn't put anything.
We informed them from second day that no one clean and still until we checked out the did nothing. In addition to that they raised their voices and insisted to put the mistake on us with out any proof.
We regret that we stayed in this hotel
And Will never recommend it to anyone.",negative
Loved it great location,positive

Poor level of interia design of the room. Could be easily improved as it has a lot of potential.,

"If you use the address booking.com gave in gps you’ll end up on the other side of the city.... just go the the train station, use the central station car park, use the right lane, go to the first floor and there you are.,

Once you find the hotel, it is very nice, recommended , excellent food, great location.",positive

Staff were very helpful, good location if you don't mind a walk out of the centre.",positive
"It is a very old building which is ok, but it is super expensive for what you get. We paid 180€ for 2 for 1 night without breakfast included. We didn’t sleep well at all because the walls are super thin and you can hear everything through them. The room is also very very small and the mattress is super soft.,

The location is great. Very central.
We had our dog with which is allowed for 12€/night",negative
"The TV was very limited for English speaking people. There’s no restaurant which was a bit of a shame but not a major problem as the location of the hotel is very close to the Grand-Place which has many places for food.,

It was very clean and the staff were very friendly.
The room was also comfortable and quiet.",positive
"Breakfast, cleaner , the screaming outside the hotel that start 04.00 , and too hot in the rooms,

"Not a comment for the owners of Race & Rooms, but an area to improve the experience further. There are not many places to get breakfast in the town. We emailed Race and Rooms and they booked on our behalf with the restaurant across the road in Pitlane Lodge. We could not get in the restaurant for breakfast at 9:00 in the morning as the door was locked. Would be nice to make this easier and part of the service provided by Race and Rooms. Details including the breakfast time and how to get in if the door is locked, and the menu for breakfast. Minor comment to improve the service for others.Evening meal was booked by Race and rooms in Pitlane Lodge and a table was waiting for us as promised. The food was great and would go back again.,

Stayed here for 2 nights with some friends. Check in was easy, receiving an email with the door code.Nice and warm, which was needed in a snowy Spa!Good size rooms with large TV and clean bathrooms.Great location for the Circuit.",positive

"Housekeeping threw away the paper bag with postcards I bought from Rubenshuis on my birthday. I put the whole bag under the table (not in trash) but found it gone when I came back by 22:00. I have reported to the lobby staff but of course nothing they could do after a long day. The location is close to Brussels Central station but it's up on a slope, it's quite hard to climb up with the luggage on the rocky road. Metro Parc station is closer and on a straight way 3 mins walking distance.,

The staffs are nice, room is very clean and bigger than my expectation, good value accommodation. There are a lot of different restaurants at the street opposite.",positive

"Ground floor rooms are dark and very basic - got a room on upper level which was better but still very basic in terms of appointment. Sewers we’re blocking and smelly during the night. Lots of maintenance needed not least for safety related issues: trip dangers  and dirty outdoors stairways full of bird droppings , Hose pipes across walkways,

Food is good - needs maintenance and upgrading of outdoor areas - not sufficient pool chairs and pool is surrounded by gravel and overlooked by busy parking lot and traffic as well as restaurant area.",negative

Location,positive
"The staff were rude, the lift was too small, the corridors really dark and tripped a few times, breakfast was ok but not worth the money you are charged when you have to cook your own eggs? Rooms need rugs sticking down as they are slippy, fans need to be provided for heat waves- understand it’s not a hot destination, shower too dark as couldn’t even see - like the dark vibe just needed a little more to be safer, coffee should be provided in the room as it was impossible to have one unless the cafe was open or the food area, pillows felt like lumps of cotton wool or bricks. Just wanted a normal pillow. Toilet upstairs on the roof. One?,

The hotel was in a great location, had cool vibes and nice creative installations. I’m essence the rooms were good but not practical. The roof top was beautiful",negative

"Our bed was too soft so we had sore backs in the morning. Room size is okay for a two-night stay. There’s no minibar nor coffee/tea facilities in the room. ,

Contemporary hotel, awesome location, quiet room. Would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a short stay in Brussels.",positive
"- if you re a light sleeper, be very careful! Tram is just in front of the hotel hence the noise.

Close to a tram, close to an area called Louise and so many restaurants around! Lovely comfy bed! Stay with my family and we have nothing to complain! Huge room for 4 pax! 
Basic hotel and i love it!",positive
No Parking and no breakfast,negative
"The check-in and check-out procedure was a bit shaky, but OK. We had some hairs in the jam during breakfast, which was off-putting. The room was prone to noise from neighbouring rooms, which is not that nice during the nights. The dinner menu offers plenty of options, but the presentation and quality of the food was very bad for the  price offered.,

The bedroom was nice and clean, spacious, and had a locker. It looks like the room was renovated not too long ago, giving it a fresh feeling. The location of the hotel is excellent to move about in the Ardennes.",negative
"Hosts were very kind and nice.  Lots of land with animals (dog, some 20+ lambs) roaming inside a fence, very artistically decorated room,  top class continental breakfast, fruit trees all around, nice ambience, and more!",positive
"The staff member at the reception was very rude. We were with a little baby of one month, and even with rooms available, they didn't check-in us by the moment we arrived. We had to changed him in the middle of reception. Very bad experience. The breakfast also was below expectations.",negative
"We are 7 peoples the room has 1 shower 1 toilet it not enough.,

Good location",positive
"Check in process was a bit unstructured. 
Would prefer fresh milk in room for tea and coffee. ,

Rooms were spacious and clean. Bed was really nice, big and supportive.",positive
"Citadines was a great location just near the St Catherine train station, with only a few stops to the major international and central stations. Cooking facilities were good and there were a handful of reasonable “supermarkets” nearby. Staff were really friendly and helpful. One of our favourite places.",positive
"Noting not to like,

All staff were lovely, with a special mention for Sigrid (spelling?).
The room was compact, clean and very comfortable.",positive
Super friendly host and lovely breakfast. Would definitely go back again,positive
"Nothing to dislike all good. lively atmosphere until eleven from the restaurant below, but this adds to the weekend of racing and fun.,

Excellent location and walked to the race track and back every day, and was only 30 minutes to the paddock area. Able to leave car parked up by hotel all weekend for free. Two great restaurants by the Hotel and all had superb and friendly staff. Fresh rolls and pastries sold daily opposite the hotel. We had temperatures of 39 degrees and hotel provided fans without asking, and were live savers.",positive
"Perfect location, beautiful place, sparkling clean, spacious room and hearty breakfast",positive
"The price is still very high but I think that for Brussels you will have to pay more to stay in a decent hotel.,

The breakfast was great and really much better than in most other hotels ++ I have stayed in the hotel before and was not too pleased with the quality of the room etc. but this time I was extremely satisfied and would suggest anyone to stay there",positive
"The room was on the ground floor, it is dark inside and also cold since the room does not get any sunshine inside at all. It is also very small room, could hardly fit inside with 2 luggages. We spent one night so did not make it problem but if you plan to stay a couple of days in Brugge I would definetly not  recommend this hotel. ,

Very close to Markt Square and easy to access touristic locations",negative
"Towels were not changed one of the days stayed.,

cleaness, close to the central station",positive
"the room was too small, too congested for my family group of 6. The room was enough to accommodate 3 double beds, but there was hardly any space to move around for 6 people in one room. To make it worse, only 1 bathroom (toilet and shower all behind one door) meant longer preparation time to get ready. One of the most disappointing room (comfort-wise) I have stayed in.,

location of hotel, proximity to brussels city centre, economical parking charges",negative
"Bathroom.  Very old, require renovation. ( at least in the room we had.),

Parking is not included, you have to pay separately. It was not clearly specified on Booking.",negative
"Breakfast was ok. We were expecting a hot breakfast and we got bread and meat slices ie continental. My wife is vegetarian so she couldn’t eat any.,

We had a difficulty with communication but overall good.",negative
"What a wonderful, charming house! Very friendly, welcoming and caring hosts and delicious breakfast with eggs, cereals, fresh orange juice, joghurt, mozzarella/tomato and more! Lovely garden, too!  It was a shame we stayed for one night only!",positive
"Not at all,

Great Location! Great Receptionist! Great facilities and accomodation upon my arrival. Free parking lot outside the hotel (about 500 fts).Overall, a hoptel with great value and I will definitely choose to stayt again!",positive
"The surrounding area is very touristy and crowded. The upstairs bed was vibrating for some unknown reason for the first few hours, but luckily it stopped just as we were going to bed, so it did not affect our sleep.,

Beautiful flat, very spacious, open concept. Centrally and conveniently located near the Grand Place and shops.",positive

Very friendly service and i was offered an upgrade without having to ask for that.",positive
"As the B&B is brand new there are a few little things that could be tweaked like the shower in the bathroom and an extra toilet but Wim is on the case to sort things as soon as possible. Do leave your feed back and he will listen. ,

The owner Wim will make you feel totally at home and offered us a complimentary welcome drink and served us a fantastic breakfast the next morning. The house is tastefully decorated and features a jaccuzi, sauna and lovely outside garden and relaxation space. It's very close to the endless long Beach. The beds were comfortable and all ameneties to highest standards. A great place to relax and chill out!",positive
Perfect location directly to the racing circuit,positive
"What's not to like?,

Nathalie runs a beautiful guest house.  It is well appointed close to centre of historic Brugge and has been very sympathetically renovated to ensure that guests feel as if they are in a home rather than a hotel.  Nathalie's breakfast is superb!",positive
Clean room,positive
Room smelled badly. Inclined wall right on top of the bed's head. No blinds on the window and the curtains were very thin so the sun went through. No sound isolation - could hear everything from the outside and hallways/other rooms.,negative
"The tv that turns on on its own gets tired very quickly. The breakfast buffet was very carb- and sugar-heavy: lots of breads, croissants, jams and sugary spreads, but few healthy options. There were yogurt and fruits, but it would have been nice to have more veggies for those who want a savory breakfast.Another weird thing: no lock on the bathroom door. Strange.,

The bed and pillow were super comfortable - we slept like rocks.The common areas are very large and nice. The location is also perfect.",positive
"The room wasn't very soundproof.,

I was only here for one night, but I enjoyed this hotel.  It is close to several casual restaurants with good food.  My room was small, but comfortable.  The rooftop bar and sitting area was very nice and gave you a nice view over the city.",positive

"I would like to have some more items like, more towels, a small bench so I could reach the shells (I'm small) and some tea would be nice. But these are small details.I couldn't make the TV and the dishwasher machine work :-(,

The apartment is very modern bright and very well located. There were shops and restaurants and public transport around the corner.",positive
"Lovely room with an incredibly comfy bed. Fantastic breakfast, really great food. Location is great just next to station close to old part of the city.",positive
"Have nothing negative to say.,

establishment, studio, location, staff, etc.",positive
"I was missing an extra power socket in the room. In order to charge a phone one has to disconnect the table lamp.,

The moment you enter the hotel you immediately feel welcome there! Which is not always the case at budget hotels.. Well deserved 10 points for that alone!Very pleasant and professional staff is there to greet you at the reception and provide with all the necessary. Very beautiful lounge. Although we did not have breakfast at the hotel, the breakfast offer looked very appealing.The location is great. Still very central but a little bit aside from the busy streets. Besides, parking on the street is for free on weekdays.",positive
"- Even though we were the only ones using our shower (thus private), it was in the ground floor (we were in the attic) which made our staying uncomfortable since we had a small kid. - Our private bathroom was also in the ground floor. Another bathroom existed in the first floor (below our bedroom) but it was shared.- The ladder leading out of bedroom (in the attic) was steep and not very convenient for a small toddler and a pregnant woman (like I am). - The ""seaview"" characterization is theoretically true but in practice it's just a small portion of sea viewable from a small window in the attic. - Wifi was not strong in the attic where we spent most of our time, when staying in the house. If Wifi is necessary for you, you have to go to the ground floor/public space.,

- Very pleasant and welcoming hosts. - Free parking.- Good common facilities (spacious kitchen and breakfast room and nice/calm terrace).- Proximity to the sea, only 3 minutes walking distance. - Breakfast was good (fried egg, ham/cheese/bread, salmon tranches, coffee & juice, cereals, milk and pastries).- Even though we didn't use them, there were some nice amenities like the shauna and the jacuzzi. The host was kind enough to borrow us a bike for free.",negative

The location was great.",negative
"Nothing in particular, I would said that overall this is a good experience as long as if you don't expect anything extra.,

Overall, it is a good standard hotel with nothing extra, but also nothing to complain about. Excellent location since it is a walking distance from metro station and from the city center itself. Room is clean and comfortable. Staff are friendly and very helpful.",positive

High quality breakfast, especially the yoghurt. Coffee was lovely. Great setting. Pool fab in the heat! Old-fashioned fan in the room was great. English - speaking waitress was lovely.",positive
"Lovely comfortable B&B in a historic building in a relaxed semi-rural setting on the outskirts of Brugge, but very convenient for travelling into Brugge and elsewhere around North Belgium by car. The hosts Francois and Marlene were very helpful and accommodating.  The grounds include a barn and an orchard where the children enjoyed playing with the hosts' dog Fidel.",positive

New hotel, 3 minutes walk from the train station, just up the steps and then straight 800 meters.Fantastic breakfast, fresh bread, 4-5 fresh juices, yogurts of many kinds, prosecco if needed.Good rooms, new, modern, well-equipped.Shower is super, hair dryer blowing like hell )))10 minutes walk from the center.Big and very cheap parking just next to hotel",positive

Location was great and free coffee and tea all day, friendly staff",positive

cleanliness of the property/roomsize of the roomstaff is nice&polite",negative

Very cosy, elegant and charming vacation house,-  well located (between Koksijde city center and the beach)",positive

Great location, good value for money, comfortable and clean rooms, relaxed atmosphere",positive
"Facilities ,

Nothing",negative
"Definitely not worth the price. I have expected a kitchenette (as in ""suite""), but that was not available. While the facility is non smoking, it is clear that this was not always the case - rugs in corridors still smell tobacco. Walls are not soundproof and some other guests may be noisy at nights of Friday and Saturday. We clearly indicated that we are four, but the room only had two glasses (and no plates or utensils). The fridge didn't really work and was not repaired or replaced even when we asked.,

Good location - close to both the center and the railway station (and the zoo).",negative
"Francois and Marleen, the owners, are our friends from now on. We will always remember the fruits we collected from the garden, as they suggested.",positive
"Old hotel! Like traveling back in time.,

big rooms, good breakfast!",negative
"The noise from the tourists in the street and from the construction works (but these are not a surprising taking into the consideration the location in the heart of the city).,

Very new, modern and comfortable.",positive
"We stayed on a side of the hotel with a very poor view, industrial and untidy. If you stay high up the lifts can be a bit inconvenient as there are only two but this is common to all high rise hotels. The parking on a busy day can be challenging but I think we were unlucky with timing as it was fine for the rest of our stay.,

The room and Bed were very nice. Walk to most sights would take about 30 minutes but there are restaurants within 10 minutes that were lovely.  Parking was very easy and good value for money. Staff and cleaners all very helpful.",negative
"Great location with easy access to supermarkets, restaurants. Walkable distance to main attraction in the city centre",positive
Location next to the very select Zoute neighbourhood.,positive
"Refused 4 pm check in, had to wait until 6pm. Had to ask for towels and soap, then only one towel each, no hand towels. Wifi did'nt work at all and despite call to the managers, nothing was done.  Coffee machine not working properly and overflow full of mould when emptied. Communal coffee and tea not replenished. Bins overflowing. Heavy winter duvets in summer. Blinds didn't work. Bathroom fan did not work. Toilet seat broken. Rooms very hot with no air con. Noisy outside at night. Hit with unexpected 18 euro tourist tax on arrival.,

The restaurant downstairs does good pizzas but the beer has been replaced by more expensive 5 euro for a large beer. Big TV.",negative
"Nothing!,

Nathalie is one of those unique hosts who provide brilliant comfort, hospitality and is on hand to give you the best recommendations.

Plus, the breakfast was so generous and amazing! Thank you Nathalie for our great stay!!",positive
"Room was enormous 
Friendly staff
Close to metro 
Great bed 
Stylish well designed hotel",positive
"Insanely smaller than expected. Paper thin walls. Bare minimum accommodations. All things I’m ordinarily fine with, but this was proved the same as other hotels in the area that seemed to have much more generous accommodations. I’m sure it was priced this was because of the location, but I could have used a heads up. I would have stayed a few blocks away for the same price In an actual room.,

Nice staff. In the heart of the city.",negative
Very good location,positive
Cool,positive
Home from home in Central Antwerp. Great self- catering option.,positive
"That we did not book another night!,

From the moment the owners greeted us it was like visiting family! The decor and comfort of the home made us feel as if we grew up in the home. The beautiful fruit trees and scenery of the land made our stay even more impressive! The children loved our stay so much the youngest cried because he did not want to leave. All the children loved playing outside, playing with the owners wiener dog, and seeing the many sheep in the land.",positive
Courtain in the shower,positive
"The spiral stairs were steep and the open plan bathroom was not 100% convenient at night. We could do with few more face towels and clothes' hangers were lacking.,

The property was furnished to the highest standards and had a lovely modern and airy feel to it with contemporary furniture, high ceilings and funky layout, with the bedroom and open plan bathroom upstairs. Two coffee capsules for the Nespresso machine were a bonus.",positive
"Nothing at all,

Very attentive staff. Big luxurious room.",positive
"Room was simple, satisfied my expectations of Citadines but felt a little dated. Common areas are bright and spacious and modern, could be echoed in the rooms as well. ,

Awesome location around Saint Catherine, quaint streets of food and shops to wander close by and walking distance to the Grand Place without the crowds/noise. Great to have Velvet Peck, Farm, and Yyoga just next door as well as a handy supermarket around the corner. Nice view of the canal from my front-facing window and great service from staff.

"I’m a picky person and I really can’t find anything I’d wish to change. 
A makeup/full body mirror would be handy, but not a real issue.,

Nathalie is the loveliest host, she couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful, she went way out of her way to accommodate any needs. 
The property is absolutely stunning, very tasteful decorated and design boutique style, which as a couple of architects we really appreciated. 
Beautiful back garden to sit and relax.
The breakfast was superb, with great quality hams and cheeses, fresh fruits, granola, yogurt, cake and eggs to your choice.",positive
"Hotel is requiring some maintenance (the age of the hotel is getting).Very used towels, furniture very used, not normal at a NH hotel.,

"Large rooms, comfy beds, tasty food in restaurant",positive
"We could have done with a bread knife and a corkscrew!The front room was a little bit noisy at night but that's to be expected in the middle of the tourist area right near the Grand Place. And you do have to be careful on the stairs.,

The apartment is right next door to an excellent Portuguese restaurant run by the same owner, who was very welcoming. The kitchen and sitting room area on the top floor is very attractive, with the old roof beams exposed.",positive
Quite expensive compared to other hotels in the area.,positive

"the hotel was on construction, we didnt know about it. if i knew i wouldnt book it, cos i was with my little son, i dont like he breathes the dusty air in the hotel. the staff seemed very unexperienced. one time she called for taxi, and she didnt inform us about how long the taxi will come, we were outside waiting, and after 15 minutes i went back to reception to ask, and she called the taxi, it took him another 10 minutes to arrive. during breakfast, there was one lady looking after everyone. we had to wait to be served, i think after 20 minutes she came over to take our order. they dont have open buffet which wasnt convenient. the options were very limited, and not the best quality. there were workers on our floor all time, as the construction was going on during the day. they had their industrial cleaning tools and machines on the hall way just left like that. so the money i paid was definitely way too much to our experience.yes, room was nice and spacious. thats the only part i enjoyed.,

the location is really good. within a few minutes you are on the main shopping street, which is the centre of the city.",negative
Really nice rooms. Comfortable beds and a wonderful breakfast. Fidel (the friendly dog) welcomed us upon arrival which was really nice! We will come back for sure!,positive
"Everything needs a makeover: room, bathroom, matrasses.  Breakfast was not up to the standard you expect in such a place: eggs without taste, coffee without taste (nice machines, but quality of the beans questionable), only industrial bread rolls, ... We won't be back,

Nothing really ... hotel needs a makeover, old furniture and bathrooms",negative

I really can’t recommend La Maison de Nathalie enough and we would definitely come back again. We love Bruges!",positive
"Nice clean lined decor in rooms.  Excellent breakfast, and complimentary water station and snacks in lobby.",positive
"1. The ""extremely"" soft bed2. The answer from the staff to my question on the  small list of television channels. I asked if it would be possible to help my old father in his room to see another channel. The proposal from the staff: ""please use a tablet or mobile instead"". How could my father possibly use a tablet or mobile??3. The sewage smell in the corridor4. We asked for a small extension for the checkout time. The regular checkout time was 12:00. We thought the staff member allowed us to extend it to twelve fifty (12:50). Obviously, at 12:50 we understood the staff member kindly accorded us an extension of only 15 (fifteen) minutes. Very generous, considering the room price of 200 Euro/night,

This is a stunning B&B which blew us away. The owners are extremely friendly and accommodating and the rooms are decorated and furnished with exceptional taste.

"We didn't have breakfast, since we self catered in our apartment, but the room downstairs seemed well laid out with a variety of food and drink.  Fairly central to the main sights on foot in Brussels and with garage parking close by, convenient as a stopover for our trip.    Staff on reception helpful.",positive
"No privacy in the shower as it was in the middle of the room, with no screen or shower curtain. Was in a room fronting on to the street of a evening this was noisey",positive
"We didn't get tea/coffee refils everyday (and we only used 1 each/day). The pillows were on the big and hard side.,

The room was spacious and with a nice view over the city. It had everything necessary for a comfortable stay. The coffee/te machine was really good and useful.",positive
"I would say stepping up so high to get into the bathroom. It worked but I always stepped down backwards because the drop was high. It became just a funny thing we laughed about every day. Easily doable. Not something that would keep us from returning. ,

We loved the location and the size of the room. The bed was wonderful. We had two windows so we caught a nice cross draft with them both open. We walked everywhere! The staff were extra helpful and friendly. All the staff. We had breakfast and it was an amazing spread with lots of variety. The elevator was a bonus for us.",positive

Comfy. Excellentocation. Friendly staff. Clean.",positive
Staff were really lovely,positive
"As I said, decaf coffee. Also, the door behind the front desk that separated the front from our room was broken the entire time we were there this in the mornings it was somewhat noisy.,

We did not eat there once we were told that there was no decaf coffee. Very surprising since everywhere else we visited in Antwerp did have decaf.",positive
"Rooms were very warm and no air con ,

Location was ideal right beside metro walking distance to nearly everything in the city",positive
"The pillows were a little too hard for us and we found they made our necks ache.,

We found our stay very personalised, especially breakfast. The hotel was very close to the main squares in the town and Nathalie was very friendly. The bed was a great size and the shower was lush.",positive
"Service in the bar was very poor
Breakfast expensive,

Location - ambience - friendly staff - large clean bedrooms - good shower - taxi rank outside",positive
"Location was great! supermarket and restaurant just around the corner, few minutes walk to Old town, grand Palace, Metro station is just 100 meter away at the property, staff was very friendly and accommodating just ask what you want and they will give you advice, room was bit noisy because were in the road area many vehicles passing through. The room doesn’t have air conditioning, it was summer that time i was there, they only have small fan and it’s not enough. All in all it was great! ,

Perfect location",positive
"Breakfast is a bit expensive and only until 10 am,

The room was comfortable and the bed was really a treat to sleep in. The hotel is located with in walking distance of most sightseeing locations and for those not keen on walking, there is a metro station 50 meters from the hotel.",positive

Very convenient to city center",positive
We found our stay here to be exceptionally comfortable. Everything we needed was provided and our hosts Isabel and Marc were friendly and helpful. The bathroom is the best we have had on our travels in Europe over the last four weeks! There is plenty of room to spread out and relax and my wife enjoyed some happy reading time in the beautiful green chair!,positive
"Having used Booking.com for many years, throughout Europe and the US, it is fair to say that Gastenverblijf Chambre dAmis
is the best accommodation we have stayed. The upstairs studio is beautifully arranged. Light and airy with tasteful decor and great facilities Isabel and Marc are very welcoming hosts. The studio is ideally situated in a lovely rural location yet within easy travel distance to vibrant Tongeren",positive
"Really tired rooms, but acceptable for the price we paid. No air conditioning. ,

The rooms are all very tired and small and in dire need of updating. That said, the location is incredible and the staff are brilliant. Parking is right in front of the building and free for motorcycles; it’s not secure, but good enough.",positive
All,positive
Great location clean and friendly,positive
"You will need a car or a motorbike to get to the market, restaurants and other places.
However, I think the need for your own transportation is standard for most European vacations unless you stay in a more crowded urban area.
This is a very nice and quiet setting in the beautiful farms and quiet country lanes of Belgium.,

Marc and Isabel are great hosts.  
I am a cyclist so the location was excellent to start bicycle rides and  hiking in the quiet country lanes that go through the surrounding farm fields and also to some interesting outdoor art . It was very nice to cycle from the apartment to the Netherlands and other places in Belgium to watch the spring classic bicycle races.
The apartment was very clean and functional and I think it works very well for 1 to 3 people.  It has a nice kitchen with an electric stove, teapot, coffee maker, microwave and cookware.
 The kitchen is well ventilated with the hood above the stove. The large shower is also very nice with plenty of hot water and the skylight in the bathroom is very pleasant when the sun comes through in the daytime.
They have a very nice soft mattress that is good for people with back issues and the skylight with closable shade above the bed it's also very nice.
The dining room table, chairs, sofa and television are great for relaxing.
I was able to keep my bicycle in there attached garage which was also very helpful.
There is also a very nice yard behind the apartment with table and chairs to sit outside.",positive
"Room cleaning had not been done until 9pm, even though we checked in 3pm,..I don't know why.",positive
"I reserved my room, a standard double room. I did my checkin late in the evening and they gave to me the room 112 , the last one available probably. It was a bit warm and I went to the windows to refresh a bit, but they were locked windows, it means just the glass with no possibility to open in any way. I am clausrofobic and I immediately went at the reception to ask for a different room. The guy at the reception told me that they could not do anything as the hotel was fully booked. I asked to have the money back that I have to him 5 minutes before and he told that he was not authorised to give money back. After 10 minutes, and even though he said that he was afraid to call the boss,  finally he did explaining the situation and the hotel manager said : 'the guest can only stay there..or there or nothing, we can change the room only Tomorrow"". I informed again the guy at the reception that probably I would have not arrived at the day after if during the night I had got breath problems. I asked again my money back . And they told me NO. I wanted to call the police but I didn't because it was very late and I was super tired. I slept with the door open. How can you turn your head if someone is talking about health?Moreover at the checkin they charged 100 euros without to show me the payment machine. They just gave to me the receipt once the transaction was made.,

This is a particular hotel, with particular furniture. Clean and in a good position but there is a big BUT. The manager of the hotel doesn't care of the customers, and at the same time the staff follow his/her mind.",negative

"Shower area was very nice,   but there was not little shelf to put soap and shampoo on.    I had to pick them up off the floor.     I am guessing that this detail will eventually be completed.,

Breakfast was awesome - nice coffee machine, great pastries.     Every day I cut a slice of a wonderful loaf of bread,  and put some smoked salmon on it.    Looked forward to breakfast each dayAlso... the renovated rooms are beautifully designed.",positive
"The room was tiny. The price in the room brochure was a lot cheaper than we paid. ,

The staff and the food. Excellent",positive
"Shopping district nearby, really nice cafe upstairs!",positive
"My room faced the Rue Royale and was noisy with the window open (there is a tram just outside).  However, the sound insulation was very good when the window was closed.  If I had really been unhappy, I'd have requested a transfer to the part of the hotel that faces the Rue de Ligne, which is a very, very quiet street.,

The hotel was at the edge of the Upper Town, but stll within easy walking distance of Centraal Station (10 minutes or less) and the Grote Markt/historic center.  Decor was very chic, especially in the public spaces.  Rooms were on the small side but I was perfectly comfortable.   Reception allowed me to check in at 9 am after my overnight flight because they had a room available.  That's not always possible but it was very kind of them in this instance.",positive
"Was Gewoon, As Always Perfect !!!",positive
"Swimming pool, is not a swimming pool. Hotel was promising a bike, but at arrival they said bikes are stolen! And there was no alternative or refund given.,

Great parking facilities with EV charging and very smart and spacious suite.",negative
"The directions to the hotel have been shared before & my suggestion is the confirmation email could include more specific directions for walking from the station. Yes it is possible to get lost within 200m! We don’t need big signs as it is a UNESCO site, just clearer directions. ,

Although the place was sparkling clean, the bar cosy & it was quiet, hands down the best feature of this hotel is it’s staff, from the manager to the wait staff. They were beyond helpful, which seemed to come from a genuine place rather than a job requirement. Thanks!",positive

"I always bring food when I stay at the hotel when I come for work. The hotels have a common seating area or restaurants. The hotels  always let me sit and eat my food there. I always travel alone I like to sit and eat where there are people so that I have some interaction with the guest. The restaurant/ hotel workers told me to go eat it in my room. They where not very cordial or helpful. I’ve stayed at 100 hotels I’ve never had any hotel service this cold. If they treated me like this how do they treat other paying guest. I won’t stay at this hotel any more. I asked the receptionist if I could have the receipt she told me some bull story she couldn’t do it. Every other hotel I stay at give it to me on check in. Does everyone working at this hotel have a stick in there butt. The Aloft and Ramada and some hotel that made me itch while I was in bed always treat me never nice why can’t this place get some customer service.,

I liked the industrial look of the apartment the raw cement.",negative
"Didn't have the opportunity to stay long this hotel as we checked in quite late and had to leave early due to travel plans.  Check in was easy and the person on the desk was very helpful.  My room was excellent, it appears the hotel is in the process of refurbishment.  Breakfast was very good, great selection.  Parking was a little tight due to the building and the vehicle size we were travelling in.  Would definitely recommend a stay here and would return when back in Leuven.",positive
"The steps to the rooms on the third floor were steep and would be problematic for people with infirmities. It would have been good to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room and we did have trouble in finding the pre-booked garage. A small printed road plan with clear directions would help.,

I booked The Old Tom as I had stayed there about 20 years ago and it is perfectly placed in the main square in Ypres with excellent access to local facilities as well as the Menin Gate, the Cloth Hall Museum and many other locations of interest. The staff were very helpful in an understated way and the breakfast was fine. The rooms were clean with good views over the square  All in all, we really enjoyed our stay.",positive

They publishing did they ofer bicycle  but then they told me the reception that I am not lucky the bicycle need to be fixed I explain to them that it’s not about luck it’s about service.In terms of cleaning really really poor I would expect That they will collect the left over from the previous guests. so  let’s say it was really not Exceptbel.  Bad bad bad experience Jam hotel Bruxelles Never again!,

Absolutely nothing",negative

location, friendly and very helpful staff, ambience",positive
"The hotel is a little dated and in need of an overhaul. It is not a quiet hotel as any noise travels up the central stairwell so early morning activity in the kitchens woke us all up at 6am.  It is priced too highly for the facilities and decor that are offered.  If it was 20% cheaper it would have received a different rating - eg an 8 or 9. That said, the location is perfect.,

Location was exceptional, right on the market square. The staff were friendly and the stay was pleasant. Breakfast was fine.",negative
"It's a brand new building, and some final touches have been made quickly, so the bathroom lock was not fixed properly for instance, but this is a detail. Furniture is kea style, could be more original but for this price, it's excellent service and equipment.,

very nice flat well equipedwe appreciated the lounge with a billardBed is good, and they have some special elements making you feeling at home like a plaid from Donegal on the bed.Nice shower",positive

Rooms are still quiet , ok and have everything they should have... start to be a bit outdated mais renovation should start soon",positive

"The bed pillows were 4. Two really big ones or two small tiny cushions. Weren’t able to get comfortable! Also they provided coffee pods but no milk. Really annoyed also they took €50 as a holding deposit which I am still trying to get back two weeks later!,

The room was stunning. Huge and felt like a proper hotel room not a dodge motel. The bed was so comfortable! The pillows.. well I’ll get to that. Towels were thick and luscious.",positive

We were pampered by a bottle of champagne and chocolates which contributed even further to the romantic atmosphere that welcomed us on arriving at the place. Very easy to find and allows for pleasant trips for enjoying the picturesque nature around.

The location is exceptional. On a foggy morning, walking through the maze of these wonderfully preserved medieval buildings, you would not be surprised to find a character from a painting of Vermeer walk past you. Try to get a room with garden view. I can not think of a more soothing view for when you wake up or go to bed than overlook a medieval garden.The breakfast is varied and plenty, the staff excels professionally and is very caring. And do leave your number, in case you forget something. I did - and was promptly called by reception that I had, indeed, forgotten my slippers. Oh - I forgot the bar.

"Staff are not overly friendly, but ok. I strongly feel that if you stay 3 nights or more that a clean should be included and not an extra cost. We stayed for 5 nights but I felt to begrudged to pay for a clean when I feel this should be included. Even if fresh towels were given that would be nice.,

Loved that it was a large bed, my husband and I really struggle in a standard double now. Kitchenette was great and everything there that we needed. I feel that sugar & salt/pepper would should perhaps be included though. Loved our peaceful room over the courtyard.",positive

As this was a present and booked on my card it was not with them.   I was not happy that they had to pay for a gift that I had given them.

"Breakfast option too expensive. A bit too confusing to understand breakfast.,

The rooms were quite warm 24.5! and we could not turn the heating down. We had the window open but then you have the noise from bar downstairs, not much but so that you notice.  The hotel is near European parliament and the natural history museum but a 25 mins walk from the old town. We were here on a Sunday and the worst thing is that the restaurants and cafes are not open around that area that day, so be aware. We ordered hotel food which was excellent, even for vegetarians, and delivered to our room. The bar serves outside on terrace and that was nice too. But it's on the street, not a cute backyard. Be aware if you have kids. The breakfast was confusing. I had to ask 3 times and was still not quite sure how it worked. But bottom line is it's 25 EUR per person for a takeaway breakfast. I think in Covid times they could just do a basic 10 EUR menu with coffee, croissant, juice and some fruits and yoghurt. Not anything complicated. We didn't have it in the end but had breakfast around the corner at a cafe outside. The staff were welcoming. Peculiarity includes that they'd rather you go to your room and dial 9 for everything. Perhaps it's a cocid measure. They don't want you to ask by reception. 9 works, they transferred us to the right person each time. Service was swift. So I'm happy with the service.",positive

Very close to train station - ideal as i was in Antwerp on public holiday. Restaurants open around station area. Hotel was excellent. Laundry room which was free to use was an added bonus. Very quiet and comfortable,positive
Coffee machine in the lobby.,positive
"Nothing,

Keys were available when we arrivedA really comfortable bed and modern apartment.",positive
"Breakfast was limited (also Corona related I guess).,

Great value for money, nice rooms, super friendly staff.",positive
Centrally located hotel with city center just 15 mins walk. Very well planned and spacious rooms. Breakfast was also good!,positive
"They made me wait during the check in until 4:30 pm although it is saying 3pm and I arrived morning. And the lady kept saying after hour and I could see they keep giving the room immediately to who ever comes after noon and she kept saying today is sunny what should we do :/ and keep note that I told them I will arrive in the morning and I'm ready to pay half day. ,

The location is great and near metro",positive
"During the breakfest there is very limited space. I have to always look for a free seat which is little bit annoying and time consuming. However, I see that the restaurant works with provided place and the staff cannot do much more.,

I appreciate a change in breakfest offer, there are boiled eggs. However, if you could offer scramble eggs, I would be totally happy.",positive
"The staff required a 50 Euro safety deposit (which in itself is pretty unusual), and there was some confusion around returning it.The hotel is within 20 minutes walking distance of the city center, not too convenient.,

Fabulous breakfast, great bed (wider/longer than usual, extremely comfy). The hotel's underground parking was pretty convenient, if a bit too cozy.",positive
"I thought at first that a mini bar should contain more than 2 little bottles of still water but it was so easy to fetch some drinks from the bar or use room service so no worries. Also a little bit more expensive than similar hotels but worth the money!,

Brand new hotel slightly out of the city center (but at the central train station), which makes it ideal if you are more of the kind seeking relaxation rather than bar and pub adventure. Everything is in mint condition and the staff is very friendly. We booked a superior room which was simply stated ""superior"". A large cosy room with an extremely comfortable king size bed and excellent pillows. We slept like babies! In addition the sound proof room was so quiet we started to assume that we were the only guests in the hotel :-)",positive
"It’s quite noisy with the trans running right outside our room ,

The quirkiness",positive
"There is no door at the shower and no space at all in the room.,

The hotel has got a beautiful garden, it is clean, is located in a very quite area and it is close to the center.",positive
"Everything met expectations.  It isn't 300-400 Euros per night, so if you book set your expectations accordingly.  Request a lower floor if you have trouble with stairs.,

Great location, lovely patio and the staff were really great. I was travelling with my 14 daughter and the staff we're very polite and approachable.  Morning breakfast on the square was the best!",positive
Very well thought about rooms and common spaces. Very friendly staff and great location.,positive
"Warm water supply.,

The location, value for money, exceptionally friendly and helpful staff, impeccable wifi.",positive
During the night we woke up because of noise/music outside.,positive
"The air extraction from the bathroom was disturbing to fall asleep, as it didn’t seem to go off and was rather noisy. Otherwise everything was perfect!,

Coffee corner and water available at own will. Eco-friendly philosophy is very Important for them as is for us ! Friendly staff , good deal for nearby parking .",positive
"Could be little bit more choises for a breakfast.,

Very nice experience, perfect and  artistic creative rooms, everthing was amazing.",positive

The hotel is close to the city, just a few minutes walk",negative
"Because of covid a lot of the facilities were closed,

The rooms were perfectly clean and the roomservice menu was delicious",positive
"The bed was a little too hard for us, but that’s personal.,

Very welcoming host. The place was brand new, super clean. Everything you could possibly need was there.
Town of Eupen at walking distance with nice restaurants. Hoge venen at driving distance for hiking.",positive
"All in all it was great! The female staff is amazing! The only negative point was that the gentleman working on Friday night and Saturday night was a lot less friendly compared to the awesome ladies working during the day, who were always ready to help and making sure our experience was the best. The man at the reception appeared to be in a bad mood both nights and not very warm to the guests at all. He wasn't very keen on helping or answering questions. The contrast with the staff during the day was very big. Another thing is that the air-conditioning or the cooling option in the room didn't do its job, which happened the first time we visited MIL as well. We had to ask for an extra ventilator for the second night, which they luckily sent up to our room immediately and that made a difference. ,

The hospitality (the female staff like I mentioned, they are amazing!), the atmosphere, the location, the coziness and the cleanliness.",positive
Everything in the hotel is new and very clean. Great design in the rooms and in the common areas. The breakfast was rich and with quality products.,positive
"Great location, short walk to city centre. Nice places to eat close by.",positive
"Bit of noise from the lift. Only one room key given and my husband came back after me and couldn't get in without the key,

Very clean and modern room, very close to the center. Car park behind the hotel very reasonable.",positive
"From a hotel of that standard I was waiting more of a guest-focus small attentions - such as turndown service, small complementary goods, bottled water. I mean the hotel and the room were definitely ok, but I felt I was missing that ""something more"" that makes a place really special.Also when we asked at the reception about moving by car and parking in the street, no one mentioned the LEZ registration that was needed, it would have been a useful information to receive,

I think price was quite convenient for the room we had : it was really big, equipped in a quite comfortable way. Bathroom was big and the separate toilet made it quite ""homy"".The location was also good - fairly near to the city center but still easy to park in the street (we were by car)",negative
All was wonderful! Thank you!,positive
"Unfortunetaly there is no Air Condition!,

"The couch bed was quite uncomfortable for my son. Also, the movements from the neighbours above us (walking, showering and toilets flushing) was quite loud (we stayed on the first floor),

It’s close to various tourist spots and among a variety of good restaurants.",positive
"The stuff is so nice and helpful, especially a gurl6 with black hair but i can't remember her name. The location is very good. You can walk to grand place and to brussels central station. Clean and nice hotel.",positive
"It took 3 requests to get a new light bulb fitted in the WC!,

Lovely big room with comfy bed and an excellent shower room. Pleasant decor and nice layout with separate areas for the desk and a dressing room. Very close to tram stop which made getting around very easy. The area is very quiet, choice of bars or restaurants approx 15 mins walk away or a short tram ride. Supermarket nearby if required.",positive
"We didn't have a reliable Wi-Fi connection in our room. Only in the reception and dining room on level 2.
We agreed to not have room service regarding collecting our towels but there were no hooks or anything to hang our  towels to dry.
There was nothing to stop the shower water from going onto the drying area and toilet! No screen!
There didn't seem to be any internal sound proofing from revellers who kept us awake for quite a while.
As with most hotels,  the breakfast was cold.. e.g. eggs, uncooked bacon.
. ,

We were pleased to have been upgraded... our room was lovely and spacious. Our bed was huge. It was new and modern and very clean. The bed was really comfortable.
We were very happy with the bar area... lovely ambience and great staff.
Good choice of breakfast food... nice coffee etc 
Liked our big panorama windows in our room. All in all, mostly pretty good!
The train station is very close and the free shuttle service to town is great.",positive
"-no air-conditioning for the hot weather-no fridge in the room (which is really basic)-uncleanliness of the rooms, there was still hair in washed bedsheets and cornflakes on the floor when we checked in.-no ventilation fan in the bathroom which made the room so stuffy and smelly-customer service wasn't really helpful, they were careless,

nothing- the price we paid for for a  hotel did not meet a three star hotel expectation at all. I would never stay here again. ( please stay away). The photos shown vs reality of the hotel doesn't match too.",negative
"The room needs a makeover and if I'm not mistaking there are already plans to do that.,

Friendly and helpful staff, nice bar and restaurant with good food.15 min walk from the city centre and a bus stop to Gasthuisberg, Central station just in front",positive
"The mattress on the bed kept slipping off the bed.,

The meals were delicious.",positive
"No English instructions for appliances, air conditioning not functioning correctly, parking knowledge for disabled people not good, bed not comfortable, dishwasher fell out of fitting when tried to open,

Staff attitude great nothing too much trouble, breakfast was lovely although at 15 euro's per person a little expensive, complimentary tea,coffee, milk only on first night,",negative
"Although the hotel was empty and we paid for a king room, we were first given a standard room on the 1st floor. After questioning, we were given another room (exact the same with a bigger bed). The room had no view and there were some humidity marks on the walls and the blinds were dirty. ,

Good location, staff was friendly, bed was very comfortable.",negative
Great flat in a wonderful location. The owners are extremely nice and helpful. We'll definitely come back.,positive

The location of the hotel was great, next to the metro station with many restaurants and bar around. The bed was also very good.",positive
"Nothing ,

Everything",positive
"Room facility is okay except that the bed and pillow are too hard it made our whole body hurts in the morning. Parking lot is super small, could’ve been bigger since guests hotel have to pay for that. I would suggest them to also replace the room key to card. Current key is too heavy and big to bring in the bag.,

It’s a perfectly location hotel. Close to metro/tram station. 15 - 20 mins walking to Antwerp Central Station. Staff is very helpful and friendly.",negative
Staff was awesome and helpful. Would definitely book again if I'm in the area.,positive
"No air conditioning, and in a sketchy part of town.  Parking was 15 euros a day paid to hotel on top of room fee.  Restaurant and down statues bar were never open to use and pool was loaded with children so we couldn’t use that either. ,

Staff was nice",negative
"The room is starting to look a bit old and tatty - needs a refresh, re-paint.  Room was also over priced.,

Size of the room was great. As was location, food, and view.",positive

Great location , coffee , staff were so helpful Sergio especially, great food particuy the mussels !",positive

Very friendly staff and very nice hotel. 
All the details are very nice really love it!",positive
Very clean and nice staff,positive
"This is the first time I saw that the toilet was in another part of the room and the wash & bathtub in another room. You can't just get in to the bathroom expecting to do all your activities in one place.,

The place was good, friendly staff and clean.",positive
Good location near to the centre of Brussels but it wasn’t noisy. Good size room with comfortable bed.,positive
"Only thing I didnt like was that they was no iron/iron board in the room and when requested it took awhile for us to receive it but apart from that everything was great.,

Firstly I loved the welcome we received from reception especialy Grace she took care of us very well and recommended things to do in the city. I also loved the junior suite we stayed in, it was amazing.",positive
"Difficult planning of the room, lack of tumbler switches, toilet is a very very small separate room. Wifi is working badly, always loosing connection.,

Good location, with parking nearby, big room with nice design, very comfortable bed and microclimate, big TV.",negative
"There was no air-conditioned! I was so disappointed because we visited Belgium in Summer and we were quite sweating in the room although at night it was A BIT chill (there was a small fan tho), but still it was so hot inside the room. When we opened the window for the air to get in there were some noises from the cars and garbage bins and other source of noise. I just hope the property informed the customers about this. I understand it’s cold during winter, but I also hope they understand it’s hot during Summer. But overall it was fantastic!,

I love the ambiance!! Amenities are fabulous! A great place for everyone! It has an overlooking view of the city from the rooftop! My niece loved the swimming pool :-)",positive
"Small windows, so can feel a bit closed in.,

Nice location, good clean room, very friendly, helpful and informative staff. Comfortable stay over a weekend. Thank you!",positive
"good location ,  the manager was very helpful. rooms were clean and comfortable.",positive
"My room that I booked mentioned about cooking facilities / microwave etc. But nothing was available. It was not clean, dust could be seen and felt everywhere.,

Not much",negative
"The only thing that I can point out is that at check-in I was told towels would be available at the entrance of the pool, while there were none. In the dressing room there was a piece of paper on the wall explaining that they do not do this anymore and you have to bring one from your room, this is no issue for me but this could be told at check-in.,

The pool and gym were very clean and spacious. Even in times of COVID-19, there was a nice management of the pool and gym so everyone can enjoy them. The air conditioning was super nice to have and was on before I checked in so the room was already cool. The staff was always super kind and helpful.",positive
"Location, friendly  staff, very clean.",positive
Excellent location. Really good service.  Easy access. Nice view from the rooftop. To be recommended,positive
"The bed was comfortable but really hot - even though the room was not particularly warm. A tea towel for the kitchen would have been useful ,

The location is fantastic with lots of restaurants and a short walk to the historic centre. Room was large, clean and comfortable and the staff/reception was great. Handy to have a kitchenette",positive
"I felt like the room was not a true representation of what I had been lead to believe on booking.com,

The decor and the lobby made the hotel feel like a luxurious one. It was super clean and the staff were very friendly. the location of the hotel was just a short walk from the city centre and was next to a great convenience store and lots of restaurants",positive
"Air conditioning,

Everything",positive
"The room was amazing and clean, the location is quite nice, 15-min walk to the city center",positive
"No AC! If it’s hot weather do not stay. On a very busy street with cars and regular trams running late and starting early. Windows when closed are great and you hardly hear the traffic but if you need the windows open don’t stay as you won’t sleep.,

Funky quirky deco, nice breakfast. Pool is good to cool down in. Not for swimming and the rooftop bar has great views of the city",negative
"Room was a bit oldish and worn out. Currently construction works. But we were compensated by free parking. ,

Great Breakfast",positive
"A simple old fashioned hotel , but in an excellent location for the Menin Gate and the central square - an easy old world charm",positive
"Waking up at 7:30 because of the hotel renovation. They were destroying the two rooms next to mine.
Too much noise from the street.
An advertising placard from the hotel with two strong lights right next to the window illuminating the room all night. 
There is no hand soap. Some showers flood all your bathroom. 
Sometimes you have water in the fridge, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you have flip flops, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you have a towel for drying the dishes, sometimes you don't. Etc.
Sometimes you find a dirty oven when checking in, sometimes you can find the dishwasher machine with dirty dishes inside.",negative
"The only thing missing was any kind of food service. But that is not their fault. It's a pandemic, after all. I just wish that had been clear when I booked my room, because my booking said that breakfast was included. It was not. :-/,

I can't say enough nice things about the staff at this hotel. To a person, they went out of their way to provide exceptional service in spite of the COVID-19 constraints. They truly went above and beyond. Also, it's a really nice place! Great bedding, great toiletries, etc. I particularly liked the shampoo, and I have never said that before about hotel shampoo. ;-)",positive
"Nothing, was all good !

Very clean, team is welcoming, good location",positive
"I was booking a room at ~23:00 online from the road. In particular, I needed a parking. The selected Accor Hotel disposed of one. At 23:30 I get a call from the hotel saying I would get another room in another hotel in Brussels - to do some, please come to the initially booked hotel. It was already difficult to find the hotel I have booked due to endless construction areas and one-way-streets. The new hotel was in the pedestrian zone and did not dispose of a parking. It took me 25 min to get there (constructions, one-way-streets, walking ...). I spent another 30 min to bring my car to a public garage and was in bed at 01:00. The bad rating is due to the fact that a room was offered with a parking and and the end I did not get it as booked. The employees tried to do their best.",negative
"We had a nice stay in the appartment. It is very well located, right in the city center. The parking is nearby 3 min walk.",positive
"Breakfast must be international.,

Staff specially at reception Mr ILIAS . Very helpful always .",positive
"Not happy the amount I paid was not inclusive with breakfast,

Everything",positive
"Should be better marked from the street. You reach it only through the public parking garage first floor. ,

The location is great. Inside old town it’s hard to reach every location by car and to find a parking lot. This hotel is close and in walking distance but outside and reachable by car. Great and bright rooms with windows from the floor to the ceiling. Spacious bathroom. Very kind staff good breakfast.",positive
There is no air con and no fridge,negative
"Initially I was put in a room  without air-conditioning (I didn't know this hotel had such rooms because I always had air-con on previous stays here).  Temperature was 37C - 34C during my stay (which was for studying and an exam, so I was in the room most of the time) and not even a fan in the room.  After I complained I was given a room with air-con which made a huge difference.  I really do like this hotel, but with a caveat: in the summer you MUST insist on air-con or book elsewhere.  Also the wifi drops out more often than it should I think.,

Staff are excellent - really helpful.  Gardens are beautiful and peaceful, backing onto the World Heritage Site (Great Begijnhof Spanish Quarter).  Location very good for me as I was sitting an exam in the university.  I enjoyed my stay after the initial problem of air-con was sorted.  I've  stayed here before and would stay here again, and would recommend it to friends (but... air-con is a must because the Belgian summer heat can rival Spain, which is great if you like it hot and you are sight-seeing)",positive
"Stairs were steep and no lift we had a difficulty with one of our colleagues whose mobility is poor. Maybe our fault for not checking this out. ,

It was convenient for the Menin Gate and Museums. Staff were very friendly and helpful",positive

Nice lounge!,positive
"Breakfast is too expensive; You can easily have a better, cheaper breakfast nearby in town. The styling of the hotel is a bit outdated.,

Staff is very friendly and sweet. The hotel is clean. Location is nice, center of the city is easy to reach, if you like to walk it is only 20 minutes, if you don't, the tram is nearby, or you can rent a bike or electric scooter. It is a quiet neighbourhood and feels really safe.",positive
"Could not locate tge property easily,

Food was very good",positive
Hip and cool.,positive
"The bar service was a little slow.,

The bed! It was so comfortable, as was the bedding. The Begijnhof is also exceptionally beautiful.",positive
"When we arrived on the Tuesday night we were informed there was no breakfast available on the Wednesday as the restaurant was closed. That was fair enough but a little frustrating especially as there was no tea/coffee facilities and there was no prior warning. The breakfast was very limited. As a vegetarian with a wheat intolerance I had very little.,

The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and comfortable. Great location.",positive
"Me and my husband had a great time, we enjoyed our stay! The pool was amazing.",positive
"Visited during Valentine's weekend in a due to Covid-19 restricted context (social distancing, cerfew at 10pm, closed restaurants) . 
- Especially in these times amazingly welcoming staff answering to every single request. Impressed by their relentless efforts and attention for detail to make our stay absolutely perfect
- I even forgot to finalise the booking of a special dinner menu with them beforehand and they still managed to make it happen last minute only 1 hour time (thanks for having my back here).
- Location in the middle of Ixelles. Great neighborhood for shopping and restaurants. (takeaway ofc) Close to Brussels City center.
- Rooms were spotless and bed very comfortable
Definitely recommending this hotel for anyone wanting to stay a couple of nights in Brussels and stroll around its lovely streets! Also during a global pandemic 😉",positive
"Prices too high, room was half done as some plugs didn't work and the hungs for the towels fell on our feet. There were builders Makin noise from 10AM to 6PM, Sunday's restaurant shuts.,

Members of the stuff really nice, specially the girl from Galicia, and meals were delicious although super expensive. Good location",negative

Staff were very helpful",positive
"The only downfall was that the iron in the room didn't work.,

The bed was super comfortable and the bar was lovely, hotel was quiet even though it was busy which meant we got a great sleep.",positive
"The lift is tiny, struggled to fit two people with luggage.  No air-conditioning in the rooms made the stay really uncomfortable during the heat wave.  The small desk fan really didn't help.  The hallways have a slight hostel feel. It's about 10-15 minutes to the city centre, so not super convenient, had to take Uber or public transport.,

The décor is cool.  The restaurant looks nice albeit pricey and the rooftop bar area is great.",negative
"I would have liked fresh bread for breakfast, some days it did not seem fresh. Not so much selection if arrived for breakfast later rather than early.Room decor was dated (brown and dark).,

It was a lovely hotel. Location was perfect. Great atmosphere and lovely beer. Bathrooms were very clean and lots of towels if needed. Wonderfully relaxing place, beautiful garden. Very clean. Polite and very helpful staff.",positive
The bloody noise from outside as they started building show stands at 2am and never stopped,positive

Very disappointing management of the situation by the staff.Could have been an acceptable stay given the circumstances.Turned out bad",negative
"Less choice for the breakfast due to sanitary restrictions but it’s not their fault. The buffet is still very good and healthy!,

Room, bed, breakfast, staff, fire place",positive
"The room facilities and finishing were very good, and the daily cleaning service just as well. The staff at the reception were polite and super helpful both in their ordinary duties, as well as when I needed to print the boarding ticket upon my return to pick up the baggage, as I had some problem on my smartphone.",positive
"An extra towel rail in the bathroom will be good.

We like our room facing the court yard which is nice.  
Everywhere we want to go is within  reach and there are lots of restaurants and cafes nearby.  The neighbourhood is nice too.",positive
Very good breakfast. Also we liked the interior and fast Wi-Fi,positive
There were no restaurants nearby!,positive
"The views this hotel down as it has large windows(for the view ) that just look out onto the waste land or road. 
Also I find it annoying when we are trying to reduce plastic waste and still hotels insist in supplying plastic bottles and toiletries in plastic. Everything is wrapped on plastic still. For free water would it not be easier to have a jug in the fridge ? ,

Very nice clean hotel, lovely big rooms, comfy beds and delicious breakfast. 
This hotel is not in the centre it’s Nextdoor to the train station (no noise though) - it’s a lovely 15 min walk to the centre through the park which was fine even with kids .",positive

Lovely hotel - quiet, clean and very comfortable. The garden is a beautiful, peaceful place to have a drink or coffee.

There’s plenty of free parking on site and the breakfast is good, although a little expensive.",positive
"Nothing i can think of until now!,

Clean and comfortable room.Breakfast was okDid not use the pool so ni comment",positive
The breakfast exceeded my expectations.,positive
"Bathroom was not clean! Beds are hard and we had a room on the corner of the hotel. It was very noisy and loud due to construction works on the building that started early. We where not informed about this. The road next to the hotel is very busy and you hear traffic all night long. The hotel parking garage charges you €27,- for one night parking.,

Breakfast is just fantastic!",negative
"Everything was perfect. The location is great, the staff was nice, polite and helpful, the apartments was very clean . We had just one night stay with a child, but if I am in Belgium, I will sure stay in this hotel.",positive
"I think paying for breakfast might be a better, it's a bit hassle to go upstairs pay and come back. Also variety of choices at breakfast was not enough, it might be definitely better.,

I've liked pretty much everything about the hotel. The staff, character and the location were simply excellent.  I would definitely stay again . Hello to Yasin at the reception desk.",positive
"The parking facility. Locked in completely and had to rearrange half the garage enable myself to get out with only mm to spare. That at a rate of €20,- per day is completely out of range.,

Got a fair choice staying in the booked room with large balcony or switch to a bigger room with smaller balcony at the same rate.",positive
"Great value for money, close to city center and reasonable parking fee.",positive

The location was perfect, the price was fair and the staff were incredibly helpful.",positive
"Some of the staff were just cold, we had some disturbing experiences. The guy who banged on our door thn didnt even say sorry or the guy that called our taxi while leaving to the airport. These 2 guys should change their career choice. Truely unfriendly and unfit for hospitality.,

Large, spacious rooms. Location",positive
"There was a 15 minute delay with checking in owing to a computer problem. However, this was only a very minor point and could happen at any hotel. ,

The location was brilliant, located just 5 minutes away from Bruges train station, yet also within easy walking distance of the attractions in the city centre. 
The hotel is very modern (only around a year old) and, as a result, is very high spec. The champagne at breakfast was great too!",positive
"There is a lot of noise in the street (police/ambulance/garbagetrucks). This wakes you up at night or very early in the morning, even when you are a heavy sleeper. The rooms are not well ventilated, but luckily you can open the window. It just takes a little time for the dull smell to go away. ,

The location is in a nice neighborhood, there are many restaurants/lunchrooms within walking distance. It was a nice place to take a walk in the evening. The staff is very nice and helpfull. The rooms and the pool were clean and the rooftopbar has a nice view!",negative

Kindness of citizen",positive
"Didnt like the fact that I paid hotel 45 days in advance. Whole amount. I know it was non refundable rate, but first time in my travel life I have to paid before check in. So please dont repeat it was non refundable. 
So anyone who book via booking will pay right away, what can be crazy if you book 90 days in advance. Expecially if you stay longer and your company is paying. 
Other Hotel offer discount for early book, and in this Hotel you will pay as soon as you book (if you choose non refundable rate).
Not nice. Managers sould think abiut this kind of move. I understand it was non refundable, but it is just crazy to make me pay so many days before check in.
I will arrive again, because I liked Hotel, but please change this policy. ,

Great breakfast and great gym/sauna/pool.

It is located next to the EU parliament and next to a train station so that is very convenient for traveling. It is central enough but not in the middle of Brussels so it is quiet. Mathieu at Front Office welcomed us well and there was also a Tunisian concierge who always greeted us. In the F&B, Sandra was always a nice host and of help.",positive

The owners offered plenty of excellent advice on take away food (due to the pandemic many places were closed) and even prepared a lovely dinner table for us.

"Room temperature was a bit difficult to regulate (fan / thermostat didnt seem to make any difference),

Modern and clean hotel with small-ish but nice rooms. Very comfy bed! Rooms are quiet, very good insulation despite the central location of the hotel. Breakfast was good and the bar is very stylish. Located right in the middle of tram stops. If you didnt book breakfast, there's a bakery within 50m. Staff was very friendly ad provided city maps, advice etc.",positive
"We had to order and pay for our breakfasts for the two days in advance, 15 euro per person. The breakfast was very poor value for money indeed. No choice of cereal, just corn flakes in a plastic tube. The cheese slices curled at the edges, no fruit. Just orange juice (no choice), cornflakes, roll with some ham and cheese and coffee. 15 euro!! We have stayed in Yores hotels before so know that by comparison this was VERY poor!  On the last morning, there were no cereal bowls or cereal - we had to ask for some. The stairs to bedrooms share access to the cafe WC!  The door was always open with a constant spell of urine etc emanating up the stairs. The stairs and bannisters were wobbly and insecure. Both bedrooms had curtains which did not close properly due to missing hooks. The carpets needed a good clean. Two of our party were in their early 80s. We were on the 2nd floor which they could manage okay but there was no light up the final three steps - it was broken - and though we pointed this out it was not fixed.Paid staff were friendly but the owner was not - no welcome or enquiry as to our stay. The whole stay at Old Tom was a big disappointment.,

Location was central.  Bed linen and towels were clean. Cafe was nicely decorated.",negative
Hospitality and service was impeccable.    We look forwards to returning.,positive
"Even if breakfast is not included, the owner nicely provides croissants in the morning plus coffee or tea self served. Area is easily connected with many public transports, and 15 minutes walk from the Cathedral. Rooms are nicer that expected, and brand new (a nice terrace not shown in the photos)",positive
"Minibar could be filled with drinks not only 2 mineral water in cans. ,

Friendly staff. Easy check in check out. Clean rooms, nice bath rooms, big rooms with lots of space.",positive
"Not any item about this to say, all was wonderful and fine.,

From arrival to departure you're in a great place, safe and confortable. We enjoyed the calm and the nice accommodation. The owner came introducing himself and was very kind to offer a drink.",positive
"I didn't like that you can not charge things to your room. As a business traveler it is more convenient to be able to have access to all the hotel offers (restaurant, bar, etc.) without having to worry about carrying cash or cards on you.Also, although there is a workout space available at the gym next door, it does not open until 08:00 which is 2 hours later than I like to exercise.,

Good people. Nice atmosphere. Value for money. Good location.",positive

Good room - fairly big and clean. The hotel staff were helpful. Located near a tram stop so easy access to the city. Good breakfast",positive
"Very well located, excellent breakfast, extremely comfortable",positive
"1) The designated fire escape from the room was an old, rusty, vertical ladder that was accessed by climbing out the bedroom window; 2) The banister running up the stairs was insecure; 3) The bathroom had been recently refitted but it was cramped, there were exposed wires next to the sink where the electrical socket had come off the wall and the shower wasn't cleaned thoroughly; 4) Towels and bed linen were threadbare and mattress was old and unsupportive; 5) Door to the room jammed and door handle was coming off; 6) the room decor was very old and shabby, as was the furniture; 7) We were woken up at 05:00 by doors slamming downstairs,  this went on for at least an hour (the bare walls and floor in hall and stairs amplified the sound). I could list more but I think this description is enough to illustrate the poor condition of the accommodation.,

Location, right on the Grote Markt.",negative
"Everything was just perfect,

Katrien and Steven are kind, warm people and go to all ends to make sure you feel more than comfortable. Rooms are cozy and lovely. We loved our weekend in Ieper and our stay, the breakfast and the hospitality was truly exceptional. Highly recommend!!",positive

"The shower partition glass does not cover sufficient area to avoid splashing water on the bathroom floor.,

Friendly staff, clean premises",positive
"Nothing. Everything was absolutely wonderful!,

The interior of the building made a great impression on us. The photos reflect the nature of the place in 100% - everything fits together in every place. We were positively surprised before we got to the facility - the host clearly explained how to get there and where to park. On the ground floor, right after entering through the beautiful, large door, we could use the living room, where we could relax with a welcome beer or coffee and feel like in a small cafe. Delicious breakfast is served in the same room, options for vegetarians and vegans were a nice touch. The host is on site practically all the time and is very helpful - full of professionalism. The rooms are on the floors, there is no elevator but that only adds to the charm of this magical place. Both the room with a balcony overlooking the street and the room overlooking the garden are beautifully decorated, clean, with comfortable beds and an equipped bathroom. Fast WiFi throughout the building and the proximity of a tram stop (literally 10 meters from the building) are additional advantages of this place. Thank you for your hospitality!",positive

"The bathroom's motion sensor made it difficult to use the shower. Showers were taken in the darkness because the sensor would last very little. There was a bad smell coming out of the bathroom.,

Breakfast was too expensive, even though it is a buffet kind of breakfast 20 euros per person is definitely too much, you can go in the city center and eat in one of the amazing patisserie there located. ,

This hotel provides all the services you may need during your stay. Located just 5 minutes away from the city center, it is in a good position, just near the train and bus station. The staff was very helpful, the room had a lot of space and was cleaned properly.",positive

For sure I would recommend this hotel.",positive
"I am never disappointed with Old Tom. I enjoy staying there, and appreciate it for being a small well run hotel.,

I have stayed at Old Tom on a number of occasions over the past 25 years, and will stay there again when I next visit Ypres. For me Old Tom is perfect - excellent location, staff and restaurant. The restaurant has been redeveloped over the years and is very ""light"" and has a good feel about it. The accommodation remains the same as it has always been, and although some may consider the bedrooms to be ""old"" I think of it as querky and very fitting for the building and its history. The bedrooms are comfortable and clean and have everything needed for a short stay. If you are looking for a 5* hotel experience then go stay in a 5* hotel. If you are looking for a friendly, small, well run, comfortable hotel that serves very good food and is ideally located on the town square, then Old Tom is perfect. I shall continue to return.",positive

"(These things were very minor and didn't affect our stay at all, I read some of the bad reviews here and luckily we didn't experience anything near that bad. Maybe we were just lucky?)We drove here using a van and could not get a parking spot in the hotel, the van was too big. However, this was easily solved as there are many public parking spots around.Tea and coffee are only provided in the lobby and not in the room. You have to buy tea and coffee yourself if you want to have it in your room (or go down the lobby to get it and go back up to your room again).,

The staff were super friendly and very helpful! For 6 people, we booked a studio apartment (1 bed & 1 sofa-bed) and a standard room (1 bed) but upon checking in to the hotel they gave us 3 standard rooms instead! We were lucky there was an empty standard room and the staff was really kind to have offered us the room.

"I really liked that it has sauna and pool. Also Front desk supervisor Catherine was extremely nice. I had an issue with a booking.com, so she helped us to solve it. Was busy at the front desk and she is great multitasker. She was around staff member and at the same time with us and also served customers on the phone. She supposed to be manager for sure!!! Breakfast was nice also.",positive
"The hotel is just very old and run down. Tiny room, third floor up rickety stairs, couldn’t get the tiny TV to work. Bathroom ok, but tiny. Pillows dreadful. There was a sort of window, but just looked on to buildings. This is a very budget and basic OLD place.,

The staff were very helpful and pleasant. The location was excellent, right on the main square in the town.  There was parking available in the square outside the hotel (paid separately but not expensive)",negative
Fabulous hosts - recommended to all our friends. The best we have stayed at by far :),positive
"A brand new accommodation,  decorated with taste and love. A beautiful room, comfortable bed, good coffee, and a very friendly host. At 5 minutes walking distance from the old center and opposite the Begijnhof; perfect location!",positive
"For me no improvements needed, just keep up the standard. Very good breakfast.,

A very nice hotel, clean and comfortable, with excellent staff.",positive
"I wondered if our room (which was decided off from the one next door by sliding pocket doors) was as private as if there had been a wall instead. At times I could hear the next door floorboards creak, but that is always a feature of old buildings.,

The style of the property mixes contemporary with traditional is a harmonious way. The staff were friendly and spoke English fluently. The car parking was safe and adjacent.The breakfast was delicious and kept us going all day.",positive
"No restaurant - I gather there has been a court case brought by the University to stop competition from their own restaurant next door - which was of course shut during our stay,

close to centrewell maintained comfortable",positive

The room was lovely. The bed was so comfy. I had came to Antwerp for surgery and needed to rest up for a couple of days. The staff couldn't do enough for my friend and I as we couldn't really leave the room. They were absolutely fantastic. So kind,positive
"The iron in iron room was not water-spray.,

Central good location with nice and quiet room.",positive
"The bathroom was not too clean, the room was cold at our arrival. There were no carpets which made it feel even colder.,

The location was good, the hotel is in a small square with nice restaurants and very close to the city center with all the attractions.",positive
"There was plenty of choice for breakfast, hot and cold , cereals, juices, breads, pastries however anything hot went cold very quickly when it hit the cold plates...they need a plate warmer!It would be handy if staff seated guests, as every morning the breakfast room was full and people were left to look for their own seats and ended up asking for help. There were lots of families looking for larger tables of four and 6 and some of these were occupied by couples and we even had someone ask if they could share our table, and there were three of us. Some forethought is needed when the hotel is busy to accommodate breakfast seating. We left our room at 10.30am and when we returned to our room at 3pm...it had not been cleaned, so we went downstairs to have a drink and returned at 4.30pm and saw that the ""Please make up our room"" card had been removed and assumed it was ready, however upon entering this was not the case, the bed still needed making, towels needed replacing and bins needed emptying...we decided to give them another 30mins and upon our return the cleaners were still in the room. It had rained the whole day and was still raining and by this time we just wanted to rest and get into our room. We explained that we had already tried three times to enter our room and had been waiting since 3pm. They said five more minutes...so we ended up waiting in the hall and finally after another 10-15 mins the room was ready, unfortunately the soap had been taken and not replaced which was an inconvenience, but it was our last night and let this pass. I understand that at peak times this might happen and if potential delays to room service had been communicated to us we would have planned our day a little differently and made plans to return to the room at a later time.,

The hotel is newly built and quite modern, good for tourists and business travellers located right next to Brugge station and public transport.We ate in their restaurant the first night and while the menu is very limited, we were not disappointed...our steak was done to perfection and the meal was delicious. Breakfast itself had great variety and value for money. We had a family room and it was spacious, modern and clean and handy to have USB ports beside the bed and in the phone. Towels and Toiletries were plentiful and ironing board in the room was great! Parking was literally just outside the front door and very cheap and remember to have the hotel validate your parking ticket during check out. For three nights parking it cost us just under €10.00. It was approximately a 10 minute walk into the centre and took a little longer if you chose to walk through the park. I would recommend this hotel and stay there again.",positive

WHEN I ARRIVED THEY HAD NOT EVEN REGISTERED MY RESERVATION AND I HAD A ROOM ON THE STREET. I COULD NOT REST IN THE MORNING BECAUSE OF NOISE STARTING VERY  EARLY.,

I HAD BEEN THERE IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND HAD BEEN FULLY SATISFIED. THIS TIME MY EXPERIENCE WAS DISAPPOINTING. STILL THE STAFF AT THE RECEPTION WAS VERY KIND.",negative
"Lack of information and personel. No person in the hotel in the morning at all, so no breakfast available. no one to ask for anything. Could not even get a cup of coffee and no facility in room either. Could only just leave the keys and depart. If it calls itself a hotel there should be some hotel service. Expensive for the quality of the room and service.,

Location only",negative
"The reception was very friendly. Good information a nice beer and good company. The Rooms where big, clean and very nice. The location is very central and in a beautiful house.

"Nice clean rooms, friendly staff, perfect location and a good breakfast",positive
"Sadly we‘ve had a really bad staff experience which put the otherwise amazing stay in a very bad light.In the morning we met the first staff member of the hotel (weve had an online check in). She only spoke French without any word in English or any other language and was really angry and harsh because we couldnt speak french. She acted quite rude and asked us very unpleasantly that we would have to leave the room earlier than the original check-out time (10.30 o‘clock) because she had to clean the rooms for the next guest.,

The room was simple gorgeous. Amazing Jugendstil and a lovely combination with a modern bathroom.The CheckIn via Mail was super easy and convenient - everything was explained very well.They organized a parking space for as which was super close to the hotel and perfect to find and park in.",positive

The hotel itself is a gem. the small perks make a massive difference. The staff was always super nice. The pool table is a really nice touch. The room is not massive but really comfortable.

"Mould in the bathroom, limescale on the shower head - sprays around and not particularly good shower pressure. Comfy mattress, but the duvet was lumpy (how can you even achieve that?!) and not warm. Hair dryer shuts down after 5 minutes of use and you have to wait for it to cool down to use again... if you have long hair like me - it's a problem.,

Military soldiers heavy armored passing each hour leaving the feeling that you in a war area. We arrive on Sabbath and anything on the streets in radios from 2 km was closed.  Additionally its a tourist groups hotel where guest arrives by buses and can be very noisy.  The price for that quality and service was too high. I'll not recommend that place to anyone!,

None of the staff were confident enough to tell them to keep the volume down in the breakfast area.  Also at check-out very early in the morning when I was obviously rushing to catch a train the male clerk in reception insisted on asking me how my night had been and my stay in general.

"Only one bad experience marred my otherwise wonderful stay: the staff member who was serving breakfast on my last day was extremely rude explaining to me that check-out was at 10h30. Although it was still early, she started speaking to me loudly and fiercely in front of all the other guests the second she saw me for the first time, telling me I would have to hurry up because she was very busy.,

This is an astonishing Art Nouveau house, beautifully renovated and decorated. The common areas are extraordinarily beautiful and the rooms are as comfortable as can be. The breakfast room is open all day long, and you can get coffee, tea, refreshments, and food anytime you want. The owner was exceedingly kind when I checked in. The place is not very central, but there is a tram stop right in front of it which gets you into Brussels city centre in no time.",positive

Katrien and Steven ,Our hosts, were so kind and helpful and made us feel so welcome. They went to a lot of effort to give us a huge amount of information about where everything is in the town and what to see.. also there is a fascinating link with the history of Ieper in that Steven’s own grandfather who lived at La Porte Cochere was a stone mason and with his brothers actually built the Menin gate, and the lions on top and many of the allied head stones ... he had all sorts of amazing photos of Ieper before, during and after the building of the city after the end of the war.The B&B itself is elegant and beautifully decorated and very comfortable.. the rooms are large and the bathrooms likewise .. well equipped and with everything you might need ..plus the bed was VERY comfortable and large!! Location couldn’t be better.. moments from the beautiful heart of Ieper and all the eateries and shops and the incredible Cloth hall where the museum is , and the Menin gate. All this and yet really nice and quiet at night.Breakfast was excellent with eggs and meats and cheese , and lovely bread and Steven’s home made jams!! Thank you SO much Katrien and Steven for being so lovely, for the great chats, and for making us feel so very welcome .

Parking at the hotel on the weekend was reasonable, though difficult to find, but the midweek daily rate was very high. The restaurant choices near the hotel were a bit limited during the weekend, as it is mainly a business hotel. We also missed printed information in the room about hotel facilities - room service, restaurant menu, pool hours, etc.,

The bed and bedding were very comfy. We enjoyed the pool and sauna facilities. Had such a nice time we decided to stay an extra night! The woman at the desk who arranged our stay was exceedingly pleasant, patient and efficient!",positive

very good location. Fair price. Big rooms and helpful staff",positive
"There was nothing not to like.  We arrived at check-in early and our room was ready.  We spent a lot of time exploring the city so we didn't have much time to use all of the facilities as we had planned.,

The hotel was in a great location in the city in a great spot for restaurants and cafe's.  Getting around by tram and foot were easy.  The staff were friendly and very helpful.",positive
"There was mould in the bathroom above the shower. Quite a bit. Like it was never treated.
The sofabed was not very popular with our crowd. 3 of the 4 who slept on it didn't like it much. I personally slept fine.
No decoration at all in the rooms.,

Quiet, excellent value, nice staff, central enough location, plenty of restaurants and bars in the neighborhood, across from a metro station, parking available.
TVs in each room, two separated rooms in the family room, equipped kitchen...",positive

All fine",positive
"It would be good to have a dishcloth to use in the kitchen area and a broom , as the room is not cleaned everyday. The duvet  was too heavy and hot in current weather conditions and a extra sheet would be a good idea.,

The location is good- opposite a metro station with excellent connections. We’ve stayed in a studio which was adequate for our stay.",positive

Excellent breakfast",positive

The secret of this hotel simply is the staffThey are incredible , if you have a any problem just call misss Lidia ( as i remember)Location 8 mnts walk for brussel noord train stationReally i loved this hotel even room service the beautiful old lady she helped me alot",positive
"Breakfast was understaffed but those who were working flat out did their best. ,

Location and staff excellent! Thank you for a wonderful stay.",positive
"Only one laundry in the hotel, has to walk from one building to another to get to the laundry. not enough washing machines.,

Close to two metro stations, do choose the one closer to the hotel, because it’s difficult to carry luggage on the stone roads. Very convenient to restaurants! Small kitchen had washing machine, water kettle as well.",positive

I like to welcoming staff at reception and specially Melissa ! She was very helpful and friendly.",positive
"Receptionist reprimanded me for filling up small water bottle before I retired for the evening. But he was happy for me to fill up a plastic cup instead. This makes no environmental sense at all, and is rather petty given that the room charge for two nights was 300 Euro.,

Very convenient access to metro and local shops/restaurants.Complimentary hot drinks and filtered water in reception",positive
Breakfast could have been better.,positive
"My room was on the top floor which was good as I’m guessing that rooms on the lower floors could be quite noisy at the front of the building. Requesting a room at the back and high would be wise,

Excellent location, very close to Metro, shops and restaurants.Relaxed and comfortable accommodation.Friendly and helpful staff.my room",positive
"Pillows - hard as a rock.  That’s it really!,

Breakfast was good, and this place suits us very well.  Perfect location and house has great style.",positive
"Noise from the next room occasionally ,

A beautiful old typical Belgian town house close to the tram stop.",positive
"Any complaints were only some personal preferences,  so not worth mentioning,

We truly enjoyed the welcoming and friendly hosts Steven and Katrien. Steven's direct family link as well as the building's link, complete with photos and stories of the rebuilding of the cloth hall, the cathedral an Menon Gate  were a unique and much appreciated bonus. All their recommendations were excellent.  The B&B has been wonderfully upgraded and maintained. Breakfast was of course excellent.",positive

Very good location, shop, restaurant and take-away are all around. The host is very nice person. The apartment itself is in very good conditions and also very clean. It looks like living at home. I will book it again when I come back to Minsk.",positive
"-,

Very friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable hotel for exploring the surroundings. Good walks and cycle tracks nearby, both in the woods and along canals. Breakfast well organised in the Covid period, a couple of decent restos in the village bring dinner to the hotel. Wellness/jacuzzi a bonus after a day’s outing.",positive
"Nothing - loved it! ,

Beautiful, historic house so close to Ypres Centre. We had a room on the top floor, very spacious and clean with the most wonderful bed! Really lovely, welcoming and informative owners who gave us lots of interesting stories and personal family history relating to the area. Plus tips of where to eat, drink and visit.  Lounge with TV, teas, hot chocolate & coffee for residents was a nice touch too. Thoroughly recommended!",positive

"Clean rooms, hotel receptionist was truly helpful and nice, we’ve got a lot of helpful info about Perwelz and its surroundings",positive
"We really loved staying here. The only thing (and we did know this in advance) is that with the B & B being in the city centre there is only street parking (limited stay (we think) outside the property but free parking was about 5 minutes walk away. We would have no hesitation to stay here should we go to Ieper again.,

Steven and Katrien were extremely good hosts and looked after us so well. They were informative and extremely friendly. The two cold beers on arrival were very welcome (after a long hot drive)! The property is beautiful and so central to all the sights in Ieper. Breakfast was great with a very good selection of meats, cheese, jam, breads, croissants and copious amounts of coffee. Property is also only 10 minutes walk from Menin Gate.  A lovely restaurant A L'Envers (recommended by Steven and Katrien)is in the same street - we had a superb meal here and it is well worth booking in advance (extremely popular even on a Monday) - DO MENTION that you are staying with Steven and Katrien.",positive

Excellent breakfast. The kindness of both ladies.",positive
"Great architecture and lovely view on the Albert Channel. The Entertainment electronic, beamer, Soundsystem, Apple TV was great. Recommendable place to be.",positive
"It was tricky to find it at first because only a small sticker (4*1 cm) on the door indicates that you’re at the right place. Other than that everything was just perfect.,

The best accommodation I’ve ever had in Brussels! Renovated room, stylish look, comfi bed, good heating system, fresh breakfast, Nespresso coffee always available, location is excellent, friendly, helpful and flexible staff.",positive
Clean and comfortable,positive
"Nothing to complain about.,

Very nice place, very friendly staff and owners. Managed my restaurant reservation, my transportation in the area, everything. It gave me that feeling of the top hotels concierge...for much less to pay ! It will definitely be MY PLACE if my business starts with the enterprise we visited nearby. And next time I plan to stay for more than one night, to explore the surrounding area and enjoy even more (I have to try the sauna next time).",positive
"We were made to feel very welcome. Steven and Catherine were very helpful in suggesting an itinerary and restaurants. The hotel is really well situated in Cantrell Ieper. Although there is no parking with the hotel, street parking is very easy - no problem at all. Lovely breakfast.",positive

"Double bet but two single duvet sheets - annoying and inconvenient 
Quite loud noise from road outside 
Room wasn’t as modern as expected for the price of the accommodation 
An ok location for Brussels sightseeing - an uphill walk from the centre ,

Walk in shower which was powerful
Clean rooms 
Mirrors for getting ready 
Nice modern bar area",positive
"the shower head's location in the bathtub is not very ideal, sprays water out of the tub.,

hotel is located close to the city center, room wasn't very fancy but it was clean and fair enough. Bruges is magnificent so you will be out roaming most of the time anyway.",positive
"Nothing,

Spacious roomsExcellent location",positive
"From the description some of the apartments have AC but ours did not. Since it is summer, it was warm especially at night. Keeping windows open is quite noisy even at night. Apart from that we enjoyed our stay.,

Superb location!!! The apartment is right in the city center. Cafes, restaurants and grocery shops (including a small one which is open 24/7) are 5 mins walk. 
Apartment is modern, clean and neat, has everything needed for a long term stay (kitchen items, shampoos & shower gels, washing machine and dishwasher etc). Very nice place and a very nice host :).",positive
"a bigger television would have been nice.,

the breakfast was delicious. The receptionist was really nice and helpful!",positive
"I can’t think of one thing to dislike!  My only recommendation would be for anyone not able to manage stairs, to request a lower level room.,

Exceptional stay - extremely helpful and pleasant hosts, seemed nothing was too much trouble.  Wonderful selection for breakfast.  The room was very spacious and clean.",positive
"Apple TV was available, but I was not given permission to install Spotify or HBO Go on it and the preinstalled apps were not the ones I use.,

Everything was great. Nice design, full of extras. There is even projector in case the TV is too small for you. Personnel was super nice.",positive

This property is perfectly located with fantastic hosts - It felt like home :-)The breakfast was lovely and the location for this part of Ypres could not be betterWould highly recommend",positive
"Nothing to dislike. ,

This hotel is a little gem. Very comfortable, quiet and relaxing. The breakfast was excellent. I will definitely stay there again, when I on business in the area. It is also somewhere I could take my wife for a nice relaxing break. I would like to give a special mention to the staff, who were extremely helpful, during and even before my arrival.",positive
"Breakfastroom is not in the same beautiful stile as the rooms are but serves perfectly for its purpose.,

Roomstyling very beautiful, Staff very friendly. We could park the car in a private place. They gave us a card so we could use public transport without fuzzing about a ticket first.",positive
"Old and noisy HAVC System ,

Very Friendly And helpful staff",negative
I thought that the price of the breakfast was excessive for what it was,negative
"The breakfast was okay, not really something I would opt for every day for my stay as it lacked variety.,

The hotel was good in terms of cleanliness, the location(everything is nearby walking distance), the hotel has 24/7 bar, huge waiting/lounge area so you can come early or check out early.",positive
Central to everything. Restaurant meals and breakfasts great.,positive
"I only stayed one night, when I got up in the morning found the shower didn't work. I had to leave promptly so couldn't have a shower. I complained to reception but their response was simply that I should have rung reception and waited for a technician to repair it. There was no apology. ,

Good location, central but quiet apartment looking over a courtyard. Apartment well equipped.",negative
"Nothing but bed could be improved.,

It was great place stay in Minsk and owner is very helpful for eveything. For sure I'll consider here as first for my next stay.",positive
"a little expensive for a single room,

friendly staff, good breakfast, clean room. decent hotel!",positive
"This B&B was by far the best we have ever stayed in, great hosts, beautiful house and fantastic location",positive
"Unfortunately this quiet and beautiful place is out of the city center, so you need a car if you want to go to a restaurant or to go out for a walk. The Herentals city center is just 5 minutes by car.,

I am italian and I usually travel 15-20 days a year in Belgium.In 4 years of travels, this was the best room I have ever had. Indescribable comfort, it is perfect to relax yourself!Very quiet, the view on the canal is beautiful and peacefull.",positive
"In house parking price could have been more guest friendly, otherwise everything was fine,

The overall art nouveau atmosphere of the house was splendid! Also the breakfast was proper, fresh and ready upon our request at a rather early hour:-)",positive
"Doors not very sound proof. The cleaning lady came in twice without knocking in the morning while we were sleeping (at 8 am).,

Short distance to the European Parliament. Good breakfast.",positive
"the rooms are quite old (and it's not evident from pictures), strange policy to preauthorize 50 euro upon our arrival and they justify it as a rule of all NH hotels, even if you paid all the money online!,

the rooms are big. not so far from the center. not really looks like a 4 stars hotel.",negative
"Nothing, good value for money,

Location, close to many restaurants and accessible for many business centers as well. The staff was very helpful also. Breakfast was delicious.",positive

Nice modern room, very comfortable beds.Excellent breakfast and very friendly staff.",positive
Friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast. Good advice. Bike rental.,positive
"The bed ia great, nice big comfortable room and nice professional staff!",positive
"Motel one is incredibly central, 15 min from Brussels Central Station, 10min from Cathedral and Central Square ""Grand Place"".The place feels brand new, the ground floor lounge is very nice.The bedroom was very small but very comfortable.Only small ""not so great"" comment is about check in and check out time, it is a very large hotel, and we had to queue more than 20 min to check in and check out too. Maybe more check in counter could be an idea to pursue especially as everything check out and check in is concentrated between noon and 3 pm. Otherwise would definitely recommend as great value for money.",positive
"Bathroom very worn down. Breakfast for 12 Euro was a rip-off. ,

Good location. Friendly staff. Comfortable beds.",positive
"Excellent location, friendly staff, brilliant facilities (complimentary tea and coffee) and very clean",positive
"I’m visiting Minsk quite often. That was my best experience. Lovely host, great location. It was way better than I expected. Looking forward to come back at stay at the same place! 
Thank you very much!",positive
Fabulous staff who really looked after us well. Very modern hotel with great facilities in a quiet location but within an easy walk to the centre.,positive
"Nothing not to like,

The owners were so welcoming and informative, their knowledge on the local area and history was excellent, nothing was too much trouble, they spoke excellent English and entertained us with local stories and generously shared their local beers on the terrace",positive
"Not that I know of.,

The place is amazing though not very central. Having said that I was there for a work meeting so can't complain. The facilities were above my expectations and the owner was very helpful. I was served with a wonderful dinner and breakfast. All in all, a very nice place to stay alone or family.",positive
It was simply a great time spent in Brussels. The owners are very willing and forthcoming people who make your stay to feel like home - and feel really the good old Brussels. Thank you very much!,positive
Great location without it being bang in the centre of town but close enough to walk to. Lovely staff and service.,positive
"They took 45 Euro for  breakfast when you dont book breakfast in advance, which is around double the price when you book in advance. 20 Euro for a breakfast is already to much even if it is ok. I made the mistake that I did not asked for the price for the breakfast. So I took the risk to get tough questions from my company how I can decide to go for a breakfast for 45 Euro.   :-(,

Hotel has a nice style with different pieces of art in each room.",negative
"Room was on the small side.,

Super charming and cute spot - great vibe overall. Nice addition of free coffee and tea, and beautiful little courtyard. Room was well equipped (though small), and staff were very kind. Loved the toiletries they provide.",positive
"No normal tea bags only ones with funny flavours. Only very small cups designed for expressly coffee,

Spacious room with lots of windows. Good air conditioning comfortable bed. Quite room. Good breakfast.",positive
"Breakfast was good and included in the price.  The silly thing is I assumed the eggs would be scrambled and they came out fried.  Delicious but I should have clarified what eggs I would like.,

The hotel team are great, answering every question and nice and polite at all times.  The rooms were spacious with netting to keep out the flies and good curtains to keep out the light.  Love the honest box for the coffee in reception, happily pay for good coffee,",positive
"Even though the brasserie next door has some options and a great terrace, the location of the B&B can make it difficult to get alternatives for dinner. Decent restaurants, some with delivery services (e.g. Bella Ciao), are available, but it costs and can be complicated to arrange. But that's rather minor if you order well in advance.,

Comfortable and clean rooms, friendly service. The terraces of the brasserie next door look directly into the green. COVID-friendly thanks to the spacious rooms that allow taking/bringing meals (including breakfast) indoors. There's plenty of parking space.",positive
"Unfortunately, No mini fridge w/drinks, no phone and no coffee machine/electric kettle available inside the room. Don’t know if they have room service but I always go down in the bar to get my cold/hot drinks.,

The 7th floored hotel is welcoming and cozy with a lounge bar nearby the reception. Staff is efficient and kind. The location is 7min to the train station, 10min to Grand place by foot and from there you can already go in every tourist spots. My room is always tidy and clean. I love the restaurant Floyd’s infront of the hotel. I recommend this place and would definitely come back to stay.",positive
Hotel in the city centre.  Near the bus stations.,positive
Everything great and very nice staff,positive
The only thing is on 5th floor & don’t have lefts to carry up on 5th floor that was pity :( but the rest was perfect I hope they can do something abt it in future,positive
Great room and facilities,positive
"Nothing,

We loved everything about it -  the décor,  bedroom and facilities, the breakfast and above all else the welcome we received from Steven and Katrien. We have already recommended it to friends and would definitely stay there again.",positive
"Spacious rooms, great hifi/TV equipment and nice view on the river.",positive
"In my opinion a small change I wish for is more separation between the bedroom and bathroom, and more soundproofing, but we recognize this may be difficult for this particular space/architectural plan. It was still ok for us. We would absolutely stay there again.,

Across street from tram in a beautiful local (non-touristy) neighborhood of Brussels. Very hospitable owner family. We like staying in places with local character and this place has it, yet the rooms are modern and very clean. Good bathroom and shower; comfortable bed and linens. The price is right.",positive
"Disposable sheets; they are uncomfortable, static and not sustainable. We already read about this in the comments, so we brought our own sheets and put them around the duvet and the pillows. We also think the amount of towels was too little for the time we spend here. Especially because we used one as a carpet in the bathroom, where the floor was very cold.,

We loved the small, cozy cottage!! It had a nice fire place (you can buy wood in the small village), comfortable bathroom with such a good shower !! The bed was very comfy, allthough we brought our own sheets, because we read about the disposable sheets provided. Nice surprise was the beer Luc gave us, but also the Dolce Gusto coffee maker which provides a good cup of coffee. Make sure to bring your favorite cups! Hiking trails are right in front of the cottage, so don't need your car to get to a starting point.",positive
"Parking prices are a little high.,

Lots of space to park, room service available 24hrs, lots of things to do in the hotel aswell as around the hotel. Bus stops accessible as soon as you step out of the hotel to go into the city centre and to access the tourist spots",positive
Everything was just perfect.,positive
Everything was perfect. A home away from home.,positive
"Something that was not so disappointing because everything else was great-the view from our room was on some construction area.,

Hotel is new, rooms are clean and quite comfortable. 
Restaurant and breakfast are good as it’s expected in this kind of hotel.
Parking area is right in front of the hotel. It’s public parking with enough space and very reasonable price of 3,5€ for 24 hours.
Hotel is about 20 mins walk to the city centre and it’s very nice walk through the Minnewaterpark.",positive
"A fan should be provided in the rooms in the hot summer.,

Nice hotel in convenient location for exploring Ypres. Can walk to many bars, restaurants, sights, etc. Very friendly and helpful owners, gave good advice for sight-seeing. Simple breakfast due to current restrictions. Very nice and clean room with comfortable beds. On-street parking right outside hotel.",positive
"The TV cable was not working but that was due to the provider, but we use the time to rest without distractions so it was not that important.,

The host was super nice and was interested in knowing our needs, breakfast and food very nice and organized despite corona. The room was spacious, comfortable and very clean.",positive
Super clean and spacious enough for the cost. Rooms are basic but have what you need. Staff were very nice and helpful.,positive
"Spacious room, close to old city and parking/station, excellent breakfast.",positive
Great location for Xmas markets. Great room for the price with everything we needed. Walking distance to main town centre shops and lots of attractions. Great cafes and restaurants on the same street.,positive
Nice and clean,positive
We booked the hotel for activities in Valenciennes and didn't know what to expect in Peruwelz. It turned out to be a wonderful and relaxed stay. Rooms are spacious. Staff are more than polite and help wherever they can. From there it only takes 2.5 hours to get to Paris.,positive
"Extremely friendly hosts, there was no need to visit tourist information as Steven provided maps and suggestions of what to see in the time available.  Location is fantastic, very close to town square.  Breakfast was actually far more than we could eat.  As the weather was so warm a fridge was stocked with bottled water in the hall.  Lovely terrace to sit out in the evening.  Only possible improvement would be small fridges in the rooms to keep any drinks or food purchased cold.",positive
Great atmosphere. Clean and cozy room with great view. Delicious breakfast.,positive
Paul is an excellent host. The great view of the room  on the garden. The  integration of the new realizations in the older ones. The place is well connected by tram 3 and 4,positive
"The floor was a bit cold. However heating facilities were more than sufficient to get the house warm. A carpet could help =).,

The location was located right in the middle of the Ardennes. You could start your hike from the property.",positive
"Nothing - just be aware it is a 45 minute walk from bus station if travelling from Brussels Charleroi,

Good size room for short stay with tea making facilities and mini fridge which was a bonus! Pool and gym facilities included, I even attended a Bodypump class at no extra cost. Will definitely return on my next visit to Brussels!",positive

Really lovely property in the heart of Ypres. Parking was easy outside of the B&B. The owners gave us lots of help with sightseeing tips. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful.,positive
"All good,

Chilled and stylish",positive
"The B&B was located conveniently next to a metro stop, so we were able to be anywhere in the city within minutes. Paul, the owner, had already loaded tickets onto a metro card for us, so that we could immediately get to our sightseeing. Breakfast was simple but very tasty and we were made to feel very comfortable.",positive
"The best place we have ever stayed.,

A quit house with all the facilities. Best for energetic childrens to run over and play in large garden. Excellent view over the entire village. The host Mr. Like was so welcoming and friendly. Suggest for people who wants to have their own time to relax.",positive
Nice Hotel all around,positive
"Loud party in hotel basement till 1AM could be heard all the way to 3rd floor. Staff was good about changing my room but they should not host super loud parties in this facilities because of the proximity to rooms and no sound proofing. Also the location of this hotel is poor. Very low end area, few shops or amenities.",negative

Everything ; the styling, the comfort, the staff, the hospitality, the breakfast and the pool table. The location could be considered a bit far away from the mai attractions but a much safer location. Caroline was very helpful and so sweet, many thanks to her.",positive
"Our view was over a construction site.  Not that this was a problem and it will one day be something more attractive i'm sure.,

Very good location. 5mins walk from train station to the hotel and 10mins walk to the scenic spots. Staffs are nice and friendly.",positive
"Nothing!,

The studio room had a kitchenette which was very well equipped. The reception staff were all pleasant and helpful. The location was perfect for the Christmas markets.",positive
"I booked this apartment 5 weeks in advance, and at that time I had a lot of options. I only wanted two things: 1) a place near the train station and 2) air conditioning. This apartment advertised both. Imagine my surprise when I got there and the air conditioner was broken. The apartment owner claimed to not have known it was broken, but somehow I figured it out in 5 minutes. You better believe she charged me a premium for having an ""air conditioner"" too. I complained to Booking.com and the apartment owner told them that she would have it fixed first thing in the morning. Never happened. All I can say is if you claim to have certain amenities, you better have them. I was deceived/lied to, and there's nothing I can do about it. This bad review doesn't compare to my hot and sweaty 5 days in that dump, but it's all I've got.",negative

"I chose this hotel because of the pool (I filtered and this one showed up) - since I'm 7months pregnant. But a note near the pool said the water in the pool was too cold to swim in, because something was broken. A lady overthere said I could go in at my own risk.There was no note/email upfront or a small briefing when we checked in. Which would have been kind.Therefore we couldn't enjoy a swim. I shared this with the lady of the reception during checkout, but her only response was: ah yes it will be fixed next week. But what's that helping me? No apologies or something.. Normally I wouldn't have cared too much, but now since it was the reason of my choice it wasn't nice.That's the only minor. Besides this, all was well. Just bad luck I guess.,

Room was perfect. Beds were comfy and seperate which we requested for with ny friend.Starbucks coffee. Clean hotel in general, nice ambiance.Location nothing special but a lot of busses that go to the city centre - also walkable if you enjoy a good walk.",negative
"The coffe machine did not worked, one bed light was broken and the whole system of lightning of the room was very bad, and no handmade painting can fix that.,

Superb location in the centre, with parking opposite the reception. The owners advised that we could park in free carpark nearby, but we chose to leave it next to the hotel.

Nothing was too much trouble...we hope to return.",positive

Helpful and friendly staff, the room was clean and comfortable",positive
"I really liked the location of the property. It’s exactly where we wanted to be right near the buses and train station for daily trips out and also near to the square with shops and restaurants. I thought the rooms were incredibly nice for a 3 star and didn’t expect as good as it actually was! The beds were comfy, the bathrooms were clean with hand wash, body and hair wash along with nice other additional things such as shower cap and shoe polish. There were a fair amount of plug sockets in the room which is always a handy and a fridge which I’ve never found  in other hotels of 3 stars - at least back at home. The staff were very friendly always greeted us when leaving and entering throughout our stay and the WiFi was really good too.",positive
"The photos  of the appartments that appear in Booking have nothing to do with the reality. The place appears plenty but is completly the opposite. We booked an appartment for 4 adults and the space availiable was really small. For example the wall was 20-30cm from the foot side of the bed, making going to the other side of the bed to sleep  quite uncomfortable.      A few days after we booked i,t we asked for an extra bed but they never said that puting the bed in the hallway (that was the only spot it could be placed) we wouldn't be able to move around the place. Additionally it was not in the appartment and we had to ask it again (arriving late at night).     The blankets had hairs on them.,

Very nice location",negative

"There is no guest staircase!  If you are at all claustrophobic, this is not the hotel for you.  Access to all rooms is via a lift (elevator).  You can ask to be given access to the staff emergency staircase but this is also very enclosed and includes a walk down a narrow corridor.  And the car park is deep underground.,

Staff were extremely pleasant, helpful and attentive.  The room was very comfortable and clean and we had a lovely shower and bath.  Breakfast was an amazing choice - everything you could want was there,  The location of the hotel is perfect for seeing all the city centre sights on foot.",negative

When we went to the reception late in the evening administrator refused to call the manager, as was too late!!!! So for the hotel personnel is acceptable to bother guests late in the evening, but not the manager!,

I liked the hotel facility, location, cleanness, room was very convenient for a family, swimming pool.",negative

Beautiful historical building with comfortable charming rooms. Welcoming guests with a Belgian beer is a nice touch.  The owner, Paul, was extremely nice and helpful.

Great little hotel right in the heart of town. Owner was very friendly with lots of local information. Very relaxed stay and great breakfast",positive
"The only negative thing I have to say about this hotel is the lack of staff. I have been here 3 times for the past year and there is always a long line at checkin/check out with only 1 or 2 staf members available to check in. Also hand out maps for tourists who feel the need to ask every single detail cabout the city. Staff members shouldn't take time to explain this while there are a lot of people waiting to checkin.,

Overal this is very nice hotel for 1 or 2 nights. The beds are clean, the design of the hotel is great and the bathroom is very nice. Mostly happy about the late checkout which only costs 10 euro's an hour up to maximum 3 pm. Checkout starts at 12 pm, so that's only 30 euro's more.",positive

This B&B is located in a very beautiful house, which on its own is worth a visit. The b&b keepers are very friendly and accomodating. The rooms are spacious and modern but with respect to the old features of the house. The tram is right outside the door which will take you to the city centre in 10-15 min.",positive

"Our room didn't have a mini fridge, but it was not that big of a deal. My mother cannot have gluten, and while there were some gluten-free things at the breakfast, she said there was not enough there that made her want to pay the price for breakfast. But for non-celiac people, the breakfast is a good value.,

Comfortable room with a wonderful deep bathtub, which you don't often see in Europe. The complimentary coffee and water in the lobby were much appreciated, as was the ability to buy beer, wine and snacks. The staff are all outstanding, and there are many thoughtful touches that put this hotel above many in this price range.",positive
"Toilet in room would take 30 minutes to ""recharge"". I told the staff but it wasn't fixed.Location is a 10 minutes walk from, well, basically anywhere. Still good, but not great.Also - very hard to find the hotel as there are no external signs and entrance is practically via a parking.,

This is a great hotel. Starting with the lobby area which is very nice and smells so good. Then the room is spacious with an interesting painting on one of the walls. The TV is very large and there's a coffee/tea maker plus 2 bottles of water for free. The bathroom is modern and very clean. Breakfast is amazing. Anything that you could possible want is there.

Great option for family with kids.,positive
"The room was extremely small so it was difficult for 2 people with suitcases as it left little floor space. One side of our bed was extremely uncomfortable, but when I notified the staff they removed both our breakfast costs from our bill, which was really appreciated. If this hotel had a jacuzzi/ sauna it would be fantastic.,

The decor was really nice and homely. Beautiful smell throughout the hotel. They had a fabulous Christmas tree and Christmas decorations around the hotel. It was really clean and they have a pool table, garden chess board and coffee area with a fire, which was great if you just wanted to relax at the hotel.

"The sofa bed is very hard, after two nights both me and my husband we have hurting backs. The studio was just enough for us and two little kids, cannot imagine to be there with older kids or four adults (no way!). The appartment building is quite old (the smell in corridors...) and mainly H.U.G.E. - a bit scary to imagine if something would happen in one of the other xy hundreds studios...,

Communication with the manager was perfect, he did the efforts to communicate in English. He was kind enough to wait for us even though we had a huge delay due to the terrible traffic jam. The appartmenet is 3 minutes walk from the beach!! It was nicely clean, perfect condition with all neccessary equipment (4 pieces of everything at least). Very good price + possibility to save another 50 euros if you clean yourself (which we did). Parking  for a car not higher then 1m75 included!",negative

"We did like it a lot :-).,

We had a very nice stay in Bed and Breakfast Augusto. No effort was too much. The hostess gave us a warm welcome and served us delicious Italian food and wine.

"The only thing that wasn’t a down point for us but perhaps worth knowing, the stairs are very steep, especially up to the third floor. Might be tricky for anyone with any mobility difficulties.,

The house is great, really spacious bedrooms, good facilities and lovely bathroom. The place was really clean with plenty of towels and even a washer and drier and space to hang things. We (6 adults) cycled to Bruges from Dunkirk and it was the perfect place to stay. Very handy having a code for the door instead of keys. And the owners were very good with communication.

When we arrived at the hotel we were asked to pay an extra €50, €25 per night for the dog. If we had known this before, we would have chosen a different hotel and used the money towards a better hotel.,

"I can honestly say I didn’t have one grumble, other than they were fully booked after we decided to stay a second night in Ypres, meaning we had to find alternative accommodation. ,

The property was incredibly close to the main square. All the staff we encounter were very friendly and helpful. I was traveling with a friend by motorbike and we were able to park our bikes right outside the front door. As a weird twist of fate I had stayed in this same building about 16 years ago on a trip with Army Cadets when it was under a different name, and didn’t realise until I was standing in front of it. I’m so glad to have re-found this little gem of a location and will definitely be aiming to go back with my partner! 
Breakfast was lovely, a standard continental set up, with fresh cooked eggs, bacon and toast if desired. 
It’s not what I would describe as modern inside, but it’s clean, functional, the staff are friendly and the showers were hot. What more could you want!?",positive

But we were hardly in the hotel and it was just for the weekend so we didn't mind as much.,

Really great location, really good price and a 24/7 bar! It's literally 5 minutes away from Grand Place and right behind is the cathedral which is HUGE! Staff are super nice and friendly and the area is quiet and very safe!Bed is super comfy - we slept like babies!",positive

We loved this place.  In a trip that was over a month, this was our favorite place.  It's like staying with your favorite aunt and uncle who love to spoil you.  The room was lovely, bathroom the same, bed extremely comfortable, could have been in a very fine hotel.  Free parking under the house, very convenient, especially in Brugge.

"-We were woken up by contractors banging and drilling at 7.30am in the morning of our final day. The noise came from the room next door and continued for at least 70 minutes in total. It felt like they were in the room. Absolutely  unacceptable. -Secondly, I booked for two people and was given a family room. They made up the room with the sofa bed open and made up for 2 children (which of course we don't have). -No staff gave any hotel or city information. -I also would say the walk to town is a little far - especially if it's raining. -The view out the window was of train tracks and construction mess.,

Nice and new facilities. The bed was amazing and breakfast was good. The staff wished my partner a happy birthday, which was a nice touch.",positive

Hotel is not located in the center of the city and most probably not that good for romantic couples who wants to go out of the hotel and immediately see the beauty of Bruges, however if you are ready to walk 10-15 minutes to the city center - it's just great. Also it's near the train station, so for people travelling by car or train it's perfect choice.,

The bathtub was nice and big, but if you like to shower, you might not like the 4th floor as you can't stand in the tub due to slanting of the roof.,

Great staff, they were extremely helpful in time of need, knew the town inside out, very patient, respectful and cheerful. 
Also great location, and has clean cute rooms.",positive
Friendly host. Great breakfast. Perfect location.,positive
"The view,

Very nice, clean and comfortable. Great for being close to the train station and an easy walk in to the old town. View from the room was terrible, but not really why we chose the place and we weren't spending time in the room anyways. Breakfast seems a little over priced, but was good!",positive

"It was harder to find than expected, as the sign for Radisson wasn't clear anywhere and when we stayed (end of Dec) the hotel looked like it was on top of/surrounded by a building site. This should be made clearer upon booking/there should be clearer directions when you get closer to the property.,

Easy to get into the centre of Bruge. 10 min walk.Room was lovely, comfortable and modern. As was the bathroom.Good bar area for a quick drink in the eve.Staff were helpful and friendly.",positive

The friendly welcome and helpfulness The breakfast was perfect. Thank you,positive
"Not a good location in winter time. You need 10minutes to walk into the town and if it is too cold -it usually is- it feels too far to walk (and too close to get an expensive taxi). A mini bus taking people to the town every hour or so would be perfect.. Bad location in general, bad views all around the building but thats ok.
The bathroom could be cleaner. There was lots of long hair on the floor and in the shower..,

Very nice hotel, beautiful clean and spacious rooms, very comfortable bed, very polite staff, perfect parking right outside with only 3-4 euro per day. We would have tried their breakfast but 40euro for a couple per day is quite expensive. A very good experience in general, we would recommend it.",positive
"The hotel has excellent location - walking distance to the city centre, but also nearby metro station.",positive
"Breakfast is overpriced, and charged per person even if a double room.Later checkout costs an extra €10 per hour even if room is freeOverall room price is too highCleaning could be more thorough in the rooms, rather than a quick 15 minutes",negative
Position and cleanliness. Staff friendly and helpful.,positive

I had a car, so the in house parking was very convienient.It costs 3.50 euro to park the whole day.",positive

The stuff at the reception are super nice and efficient. The location is good and you can find many restaurants nearby.",positive

Modern room, close to metro",negative

My favourites: delicious breakfast/brunch in the room + high quality bath products.

The room was super cosy and the breakfast, or should I say brunch, was delicious and varied! 
Great bath and very good quality (and smell) bath products! 
Amazing stay and localisation, not far from anything and at the same time isolated from the crowded areas, which is all we wanted. 
10/10!",positive

The room was very comfortable and a great location for an early flight. The transfer to the airport was very welcomed. The hosts provided great information on food near by. I also forgot some items in the room and the hosts ensured they got back to me!",positive
"The building, like many in the city, is quite old and the rooms are compact, and the floor of our upstairs guest was musical under their footsteps. A minor inconvenience at best.,

The best part of our stay was the gracious and personable service provided by Paul Asselman. He was exceptionally helpful before we even arrived by arranging parking, and offered wonderful advice on seasonal attractions and dining not impacted by COVID. He personally made us a delicious breakfast each morning and delivered himself. Our stay mirrored the best parts of staying at a B&B without feeling as though you are a lodger in someone’s home. The location was very convenient — a quick and picturesque walk got us to all there is to see in this beautiful, historic city.",positive
"-,

Beautyful b&b. Thank’s for owner Paul for the late check in.",positive
"Fantastic location, well equipped town house. Very clean and comfortable. Our host was very helpful in recommending restaurants, sites to visit etc. 
would thoroughly recommend it for two couples or a family looking to use Ypres as a base - and would return ourselves",positive
"I have to make a serious complaint about our stay in this room. The bed was full of bedbugs. The 1st morning we saw a spot of blood on the bed sheets and asked to change our sheets. It didn't cross our mind that something was wrong about the bed's hygiene. On Monday morning my husband got up with some spots/bites on his right hand and on his forehead. Yesterday morning he got up with many more bites on his right and left hand as well! We had to check out immediately so as to catch our train, therefore we didn't inform the receptionist on 5.40 am that we left. Since we arrived at our homeplace, we visited a doctor the same afternoon and the diagnosis is bites by bedbugs...We are really frustrated, disappointed and it's the 1st time that something like that happens to us! It is really concerning that in Brugges of 2020, Belgium, there are bedbugs in hotel rooms that are highly visited from all over the world.

Reception is always friendly, host is there for you when you need something. Very recommended",positive

"The shared bathroom is in another floor, and you can only access the bathroom using a very step staircase not suitable for old people. There is no external info indicating that this was a pension. In reality that's not a pension but a particular home, where you ""live"" with the owners.",negative

"Everything was over our expectations. Nice place, perfect host. Unforgettable stay.",positive
"-the bathroom in our room was separated from the sleeping part just with a curtain (no real wall). Although the curtain was thick and you couldn't see through it this solution was making us feeling a little bit awkward. Beside this issue everything was perfect and i definitely recommend this place.,

- very helpful host, lot's of useful information to share with guests- transfers to and from the airport - perfect stop for a night, when you have a flight next day-delicious breakfast with lots of choices - in general clean and comfy place",positive

Location is pretty good. The city isn’t that big,  bit the hotel stays close to good restaurants and other attractions 
Staff was very friendly and helpful",positive
"I failed to fully read the property description.  The price is good... and there is a lot written regarding all the ""Facilities"" at this location that makes you think it is a first rate property.  However... it was very disappointing to me.  I did not read the description... and I was shocked at the shared bathroom.  Not only do you share with other guests... but you also share with the on-site resident.  There is no ""casino"", no coffee maker in the room, only hand towels - no bath towels, the room smelled of Fabreeze… so I wondered about that... unsecured parking on the street... both wardrobe and closet were full of junk, one wooden chair, creaky floor, host has friends over in the downstairs kitchen and you can hear them from your room, no buffet, no ATM, not 24/7 person on-site, no shops on site.... it is simply an old house with some empty upstairs rooms that are rented out.  The furniture is very old, simple, and basic.  There is no desk for your laptop to work... unless you use something in the common area.  If you want a cheap dry roof over your head... it is ok.  If you want anything more...,

The internet worked.  The mattress was hard.  The location was good for me.  The price was good... however... You get what you pay for.",negative
"Stairs were a little steep,

Could not do enought for you. Went out of their way to give advice on things to see and do. House is very clean and well presented with everything you would need and more. Will be back.",positive

Beautiful house in the heart of the town. Careful attention to detail and the owner is very knowledgeable about the history of the town and places to visit.,positive
"There is no kettle in a room. No laundry service,

Breakfast is good. Very fair price",negative
This is charming hotel efficiently and skillfully run in the quietest street off the grand place.  Parking outside on a Sunday was easy.  The owner is very careing and is very guest orintated.  Room is on the ground floor and helpful for our accumulated luggage.  A good place to stay to vist the town and the surrounding WW1 places of interest.  All very straightforwrad and hassle free.,positive

Great house with superbe service and a really enjoyable breakfast.,positive
"The accommodation is a few minutes away from the airport. The owners pick you up from the airport and drive you back for your flight which is, in my view, fantastic. The place was nice, clean and quiet. The breakfast was very good. If I ever needed to stay in Charleroi again, I would definitely choose this place.",positive

If you go on saturday or Sunday it’s imposible to get there.,negative
"Stairs were very difficult for my elderly mother.,

Very comfortable property in an excellent location.  Plenty of space for our party of 5.  Fred met us on arrival with lots of local information, and met us again before departure to (in our case) return the required cash damage deposit. The property had everything we needed plus extra touches. Note that there is a long flight of steep stairs to the living space, and another long flight to the bedrooms.  Difficult for people with mobility issues.",positive
Close to center,positive
"Toiletries (soap, shampoo) has “gone down” in standard since last visited the hotel (Hermes to Lanvin) and the default toiletries welcome pack (cotton buds; shower hat; etc.) was not supplied on this occasion.,

Warm welcome and sincere farewell: staffs were welcoming and doing their very best to ensure the stay was a good one. Special thanks to Mariano and Tula.The very best at Sofitel and Le Louise particularly is definitely the quality of the bed...",positive

The bed in our allocated room was excruciatingly uncomfortable. On our second attempt this was satisfactorily resolved",negative
Host's kind availability to provide car ride to the airport for an early flight was crucial and highly appreciated.,positive
Great place. Nice and local to all the sights and Paul and the team are very helpfull,positive

"still huge restrictions because of Corona. (beginning of June 21) No room cleaning, no breakfast buffet, reduced hospitality... but it’s not their fault, it’s the rules ,

all nice",positive
"Nothing,

The location was excellent. The house overlooks the surrounding valleys with fields and villages, making for charming views. Plenty of hiking opportunities nearby. The house is part of a bigger farmhouse complex and is very atmospheric. Privacy was absolutely guaranteed though, with the seperate garden and sauna. The pictures do not do the property justice.
Would definitely come again or recommend friends and family to stay here!",positive
Comfortable stay. Breakfast is included in the price of the room. Free wifi. It was a good overall experience.,positive
"Pillows lumpy ,

Owners were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was good",positive
"The only thing I can comment on is that there wasn't tea and coffee making facilities in the room which was a little disappointing since after a long day and a shower it would be nice to have a drink in the room, but still highly recommend.,

Theo on reception was very nice and efficient. Hotel decor is lovely and breakfast was very good",positive
"14.51 h we arrived, and the room should have been ready at 15.00 h, but we had to wait till 15.30 h, with a commend: „your room should be ready“. The room was not ready and its just not nice and a bad feeling to see how people left the room that we should sleep. Then we had to wait again for ca. 20-30 min. 
Tea, sweaters, and milk didn’t get filled up after our consumption the next days. 
Fitness room is a joke - just to tick a box in the USP-list and to get bookings. 
Breakfast 17 € - really???
Check-out was a long queue and again waiting necessary. ,

Location & Layout & RoomDesign is great",negative
The location was prime!,negative
A very interesting cultural experience. Meet the 2 owners and you understand the history of Belgium and why the 2 regions don´t fit together. Thank you for the kind hospitality Rudy.,positive

Lovely choice at breakfastBeds were really comfortable and they were able to provide a travel cot and bedding at very short notice, late at night on a saturday. It was much appreciated!",positive

"Requested a bath on forehand, but wasn't possible when we arrived.,

Good hotel, were flexible with breakfast.",positive
"As we needed to bring our own bedlinen, it would have been good to know in advance that the duvets on the double beds are about 2x2m. Other than that everything was excellent.,

Very lovely house with big garden in serene setting. The picture almost undersell it. Host was very nice and generous with checking in and out times. We would highly recommend a stay.",positive
"It is a good place and the room size is good, as well as the bathroom overlooking the main street, including the supermarket and shops. It is good for the room price, area and cleanliness, and there is a bus station near it as well as the most important characteristic of the reception staff very well in dealing with customers and nice",negative
"Nothing, all good.,

Friendly owners, good location, good value.",positive

Location couldn't be better - right in the center of the city.  The room is very clean, the bed is comfortable. Great value for money.",positive
"It’s a proper business hotel. And away from the city. Not for families. Understaffed and I complained about my coffee machine not working 3 times but no one came to check. No way to call the reception or room service from the room and not even a bottle of water is complementary.,

Clean and decent",negative

Thank you!",positive
"The breakfast area was busy and a little congested based on the small room used for the buffet style b'fast and the access to it. The method of cooking boiled eggs was not effective. I put my eggs in for 15 minutes and they were still uncooked after this time and had to be thrown away.,

The breakfast provided a good choice.The lady at reception was very friendly and helpful.",positive

No porter service. Nobody will assist you with your luggage. Uncomfortable to carry bags through small  stairs on the way to the elevator.

The hotel is nice, nothing special, but comfortable bedding, small cozy room, fresh furniture. 
Good location, just next to a hypermarket and to a gas station,  that works 24/7, where you can buy tea, coffee and pastries any time. 
Good breakfasts. 
The area around the hotel is green, there is a river and lots of greenery.
In general,  I enjoyed my stay.",negative
"Extremely well situated and lovely comfortable rooms, Iwonie, the owner was very welcoming and helpful. We intend to return next year. Would unhesitatingly recommend.",positive
"Only drawback was that there was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. This was unusual for this standard of Hotel.,

Decor of the lounge area was very designerly.",positive
"The hotel was not well indicated and with construction going on poor to find, no signing.Towels were not clean.Staff was not educated on the bar, we ordered a champagne and got a white wine in champagne glasses...Parking is not private but public and payment can be due at hotel.,

The bed was very good, and the staff was helpfull.",negative
"Unfortunately too noisy for me. The rooms and windows should be sound proof. I have no desire to listen to people's amorous activities at 3 AM after coming home from the bar. The breakfast is also sub-standard for the amount you pay for it.,

Close to the station and centrally located. In the middle of old town,  which is great",negative
"The host was very polite, helpful.. made us very good breakfast in nice glass veranda.We appreciated great communication with the owner and quick and comfortable airport transfer. Great place for overnight stay when you travel early morning or late night. Thanks a lot!",positive
All good,positive
The Queen Astrid is located in a great location close to the main square and the Menin Gates. Actual property is modern and very clean. Host was great and saw to all our needs. Property is ideal for family and another couple or two couples.,positive
"Mould on the wall of a recently refurbished room (?). Room difficult to access with a buggy. Very unpleasant staff member at the breakfast. Snapped at my partner for our room number and generally gave off terrible, stress and bad energy as she stomped around the restaurant. Also the buffet breakfast area is too cramped.,

Pleasant check in experience with a nice lady. Nice, big, refurbished room with view of the sea. We seem to have been put in a room a bit removed from others because we were travelling with a baby so that was nice and made it less stressful for us.",negative

Nice hotel, excellent loctation",negative
"In Minsk all the best👍,

Everything is very nice❤",positive

"The queue for checking in could be more well-devised.,

The location and quality of the room (particularly for the price) were both quite good. The bar downstairs is also very nice. Overall, it was a good experience.",positive
Did not like that you had to drive through a car park to get to the main entrance of the hotel. The side entrance is a little too dark,negative
"The bed was the most uncomfortable bed that I've ever been slept. It was a double room and there was two different mattresses that merged. The middle of them was like an endless hole.
The room seemed clean but then unfortunately we found a boxer belongs to some previous customer.,

Location is really nice, it's easy to walk everywhere.",negative
"I liked everything,

The owner were very helpful",positive
"A wonderful hotel & a wonderful helpful host, would definitely come back!",positive
"Lots of parking is available near the property but at a cost. We did have a problem with the front door as we'd left the key in the lock on the inside and by mistake closed the door. There is then no way to open the door so a locksmith was called. We were deducted 70Eur from our deposit to cover that cost. However, ther owner did on a Saturday night deal with the whole situation without any fuss.,

Very high quality accomodation right in the heart of the town next to the catherdral . The location couldn't be better, walking distance to all the attractions, bars, restuarants etc. Friendly owner was just around the corner for any help.",positive
"I missed a good shower, our room the shower was not working good, we had to wait for hours to fill the bath with a little bit of water with the right temperature inorde to take a shower or a douch.And the breakfast was always the same dish no change.,

"Being always fully booked, I had to queue for around 20 min before the check-in (it was a Friday).The staff had nevertheless the nice idea to serve us free juice while we were waiting. Perhaps a larger check in counter would help.,

MotelOne is always a safe choice: 4-star hotel standards just without superfluous services (meaning no in-room services or minibars, no big desk, etc), but a very nice lounge bar in the ground floor instead. Super-comfy bed, excellent bathroom and quiet environment. Located very close to the central park of Brussels, next to the Federal Parliament, the Royal Palace and not too far from the EU area.",positive

The house was situated in a fabulous location, right next to the centre of Ypres.  Plenty of room, very comfortable and all the facilities you might need.  A special mention to Freddy, the owner, couldn't do enough to help make our visit to Ypres special, a gentleman and a scholar!",positive
"We got given a room that looked onto an internal fire escape.  There was noise from an air con unit all night. A fight outside our bedroom at 3-4am which apparently is okay for hotels! Got passed round 3 staff in the morning when I tried to complain about broken sleep and my daughter being upset by the screaming.  Told to wait over 2 hours for the owner, but had to be out of room in 1!  It was awful.  ,

It was perfect. We are both students and wanted a cheap getaway at new year. I'll be honest, we only went for Hotel Fevery because it was cheap. They could have charged far more. The staff were all lovely, and we even got given a free map with various sights pointed out to us. We even got given a box of chocolates for New Year!Breakfasts were lovely.

The charming and multilingual Paul hosted us in his lovely hotel. Our room was spacious with a fabulous bath and comfortable bed, perfect after spending a day exploring the old town of Bruges. The location was perfect, just a short walk to the centre. Breakfast was exceptional with many options including a perfectly boiled egg and we loved the special surprise for Australians! High quality, organic complimentary products to use in the bathroom, which were also available for sale.",positive

Lots of thoughtful extra touches: the patch on the mirror that didn’t fog, 2 towels each, and the breakfast was a feast. In a quiet street with a picturesque stroll to the busy middle of Bruges.

"No one helped me with luggage in check in and check out i had to bring them and i had a kid so i actually needed help. But in the way out the receptionist called someone to  get me a taxi and take my bags to it. 
In the restaurant there was a really angry waiter whom when I called him to request something talked back to me in their language and it was obvious it wasn't a good thing what he said .. he said it while walking by me without even standing or looking at me it was really rude .. other guests at the restaurant saw this and unfortunately I couldn't understand a word but gladly other waiters were helpfull and nice.  
Limited orders for room service they only had about 5 options but gladly there were restaurants all around the hotel.
,

The reception staff .. all of them were super nice and helpfull .. It would have been great if the room service guy who answers the phone was as nice as them.

A lovely little house, very well designed and the location couldn't be bettered - literally 2 minutes walk from the Cloth Hall and the Ypres and In Flanders Field museums.  You don't need to use a car at all unless heading out of town to see the military cemetries or WWI battlefields.  Lots of restaurants within a couple of minutes walk too.  Very comfy beds and all you need for a weekend or even a week.  Extremely clean too.",positive

Location",positive
"Asking me for my room number when I borrowed a sewing needle, not changing towels and sheets on demand. Small things that as a European customer are a bit difficult to understand.,

Great value for money. Staff is fine but a bit special, Belarussian style. For example, cleaning crew wouldn't change my towels but argue about it. All in all very good for it's price",positive

"the check-in was extremely slow since they had the wrong name for me - this was probably a Booking-com error.  The name the hotel had was John Wilson Clarke (from USA) - while I am John Douglas Clark (from UK).  The booking ref. no. was correct, however.  But it was frustrating at the end of a long day to have such a delay on checking in",positive
"Good breakfast, beautiful park near the hotel.",positive
"Nothing to complain about,

Stayed at this lovely bnb for a weekend getaway and to also explore the WWI sites. Everything was lovely - the bed is super comfy, the staff very friendly, and the breakfast excellent!

Good facilities, quiet surrounding, luxury boutiques very close",positive
"Great location, lovely staff, excellent breakfast",positive
"The wide windows need to have black out blinds so to have less light coming in from outside.,

It's a modern hotel and rather new. So it's well maintained and in a relative quite corner of the city centre. I have no complaints :)",positive
"Yes there is the covid and this is a special situation for everyone, but it does not provide all excuses: - breakfast: no restaurant room so they deliver it to your room...except that i never had mine, because the guy at reception told me that he was alone to do reception and deliver breakfast in rooms so he can't do everything at the same time. A big scandal in my opinion. - bed and seats are 20 years old, Awful noise when you move in the your bed (the metallic part below the matrass)The called themselves ""Luxury hotel"" but only the price is luxury, for the rest....,

Basically nothing?",negative

"The plastic cover on the beds seemed to retain heat? ,

This was an amazing hotel that had more of a bed-and-breakfast feel then just a normal hotel… Paul the owner is a one man show who helps with breakfast, serves you as you eat, and as far as I could tell is also housekeeping and runs everything else as well! He helped us by calling taxis, calling in reservations to restaurants and giving us some great suggestions! We very much enjoyed our stay and the thoughtfulness of the owner Paul and his staff and will definitely stay here again if we ever visit!",positive

"I spent an excellent and comfortable stay, the necessary arrangements have been made regarding covid restrictions. Warmly recommend it.",positive
"Have to say, I don't normally write hotel reviews but felt like I had to with this one. So much could have been better really and it wouldn't take much..We had a deluxe double room but it was so basic. All the basic amenities were missing. There was no safe, kettle, pictures on the walls, the towels (and I don't normally notice things like this) were so thin and small, literally wouldnt use these on my dog! The air con doesn't really work. There were only 2 hangers in the room, when we asked they gave us 2 more but when we said 4 between us might not be enough the manager said there were more coming next week - fair enough but the total of all these things just made us feel like the standard wasn't quite good enough for the £589 we paid for 3 nights I couldn't believe we were made to pay not only for hot drinks but for hot water..!! 2 euros 50 per cupWhen you walked in the room, ive never felt this before but it was a disappointment and have to say as it was our first time in Bruges/Belgium let down the holiday a bit. There's no pictures on the walls and nothing in/on the units - it just feels a bit basic. We didn't sample the breakfast so can't comment on that. The bathroom was small ish - smaller than the pictures but nice enough The hotel interior on the hallways or the floors definitely needed a bit of an update, I'd read reviews on here which said that but didn't expect it to be so prominent - its noticeable and overall you just feel like it wouldn't take much to update these things but money must be being invested elsewhere?,

Location was good - you are only a few mins walk from the main shops/restaurants and right by the Interparking t'zand so extremely convenient. The parking only costs 8 euros overnight so thats great and you literally come out of the parking and the hotel's on your right Staff on reception were friendly and often happy to chat, but often refused the most basic of requests, such as making us pay 2 euro 50 for hot water (we'd bought our own tea bags and milk)",negative
"they have a tiny stairs to go to the rooms, this is uncomfortable if you have heavy luggage,

the hotel is close to the train station (10 to 15 min walk) and center of the city (5 min walk)",positive

The location was great. A couple blocks walk to St. Bavo's cathedral. The room was comfortable and secure. Good bed and shower. The staff was excellent. Room cost was reasonable for that location.",positive

"We got two private rooms for us and our kids, unfortunately, the bathroom was outside the rooms and there was no separation from the stairwell unless you locked the doors, which would mean locking our kids in. The doors are thin and the other tenant partied until 2am, along with the restaurants right outside. The host was not super responsive to my questions about parking.,

The beds were comfortable and the location, while loud, was close to the downtown. The TV was great to pull out while lying in bed.",negative

"The mattresses were too soft and the heating in the room was not working properly, we had to use the additional. Also after every shower we had the puddles in the bathroom, the water was running alongside the glass and was going underneath. The sealing was not working properly. Moreover, we missed some glasses to drink from and kettle to make a tea or coffee. Maybe more hangers would be better to have. We only had 3 in total for 2 people.,

The hotel is great value for money. Our bed was very comfortable and the rooms were clean and just what we needed after a long day seeing the sights of Brugge.

Also it was very sweet when we saw a present for Christmas in our room.  So I would definitely stay in this hotel if I come to Bruges one more time and highly recommend this hotel for staying.",positive
"Our bedroom faced the car park, on first floor just above the entrance so it was a little noisy in the evening with guests standing outside or smoking outside. Smoking should not be allowed so near the entrance of the hotel. 
Summer can get hot so air conditioning would be a plus. ,

Clean, professional, modern yet with character, efficient staff, well kept property, food excellent, staff friendly. Bed confortable, the pool was a great surprise. Kids friendly. Nice playground just opposite the hotel. Our room was on the small side but fit an extra bed for a child. It was all very cosy. Bedroom well arranged.",positive

"We were somewhat disappointed with our room, which did not meet our expectations. We were given a very big room but it was not as cozy as we had expected. We later realized it was the wheelchair access room, which doesn't really explain why the room has very little decoration and there is nowhere to put your bathroom essentials. We will return but we will make sure we get another room, as this one doesn't meet the expectation of a boutique hotel.,

The hotel is situated in a small town. Though its is on the central square, the rooms are very quiet. It is warm and cozy hotel and it is quite wonderful to watch the snow outside even from the indoor swimming pool. The Spa facilities are beautiful and spotlessly clean. Breakfast is superb with lots to choose from. We chose half-board and dinner was excellent!",positive
"Hygiene was bad. Fungus in the bathroom, blower was clogged. Lot of dust on the towel heater. Several long hairs on the ground. Floor in the badroom should be replaced. Clearly no attention to details.Next to this, there were lots of drunk people walking past the hotel at night, I would recommend bringing earplugs.This is what could be expected from a 6.0 rated cheap hotel, not a hotel with this price and rating.,

Location is nice, next to fairly priced parking garage and walking distance to the entire city centre. The room itself was spacious and had three separate beds. Personell was friendly.",negative

I stayed here for 2 nights on a girly trip away with my mum and it was fab! 10 min taxi ride from the Eurostar and about a 10 min walk right into the centre of the city. The staff were lovely and the hotel was very nice! The rooms were great, everything you need and super comfy beds. You don't need to buy any travel whilst staying here as so close to everything. Highly recommend this hotel. Also let us keep our bags here all day after checking out. Oh and the bar is great too! 5 stars! :)",positive
"The host's were so lovely and so helpful! We were given a map and lots of advice upon check in as well as friendly conversation. The location is nice and quiet and only a short walk to the centre. We advised the host's that we would be checking out very early on our last day so we could organise payment and they gave us a bag of breakfast provisions to take with us on our train trip. Was such a sweet surprise. Thank you so much for a lovely stay, enjoy your next trip to Adelaide!!",positive

It never fogs up!  The breakfast was good with cold cuts, crepes, egg, lots of bread, juice and coffee.  We would recommend it!",positive
"We have stayed in the hotel before, this time there is nothing negative to mention.,

"The check in was very late, after 3 am",positive
"My only niggle is that there was no kettle in the room, this may be a local rule. I don't know. Tea & coffee was available for free in the reception area and there was a very comfortable lounge in which to sit to have your drinks.,

The hotel was cosy and warm. The welcome was the same.  Paul the owner was very helpful and the rooms were spotless and spacious when compared to chain hotel rooms. The hotel is located in a quiet one way street within easy walking distance of the market square.

"Not exactly that I didn't like it - but it was confusing for me to understand how to use the garbage can - it was divided into two parts per recycled and non-recycled garbages. Since I haven't had such cans in my apartment - I always forgot how to use it properly.,

It was the best 3* hotel which I have ever visited. The accommodation was perfect. The owner was so kind, hospitable and supportive. The liked the breakfast - fresh bread, pancakes, butter and jams. The thing which I liked the most was the bed and the USB charges near it - it is untypical for the hotels but so useful!",positive

"There was this strange smell in the studio that seemed to be coming from the bathroom – closing the door of the bathroom did help though :-),

Good value for money. Private car parking which was secured with a gate at night. Stayed here to participate in Liege-Bastogne-Liege. Since we finished late and were too tired to go anywhere, the night shop next to the studio was very efficient to grab ourselves some food! We had a sofa bed and it was actually okay (we slept in beds with matresses that were much worse).",positive
Walking distance to city centre,positive
Paul is the perfect host and we were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived. We were given many good tips and experiences to consider during our visit. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute slow walk to the center but this means it is nice and quiet and you get to see some other parts of Bruges that you might not have seen. I have stayed in many hotels in Bruges and this is one I would go back again to for sure.,positive

Also monday and tuesday the restuarant is closed, one of the reasons I go to that hotel. pitty.,

could not have breakfast, I had to check out 1h before breakfast",negative
"The building is showing its age - the facilities are a bit old but nonetheless clean and in a good state. My room was a bit chilly overnight but the duvet was very warm.,

The location of the hotel is ideal. Being in the outskirts of the centre of town means that it's very easy to get around. It's a 10 minute walk from the train station and also 10 min away from the main tourist attractions. There are also plenty of lovely restaurants and cafes nearby. The staff members went out of their way to make my stay pleasant. The room was lovely and clean. The bed was so comfy that I snoozed my alarm 2 times in the morning before I finally got up.",positive

"I did like the good communication upfront my stay. Everything the service, the breakfast, the size of the room and the furniture was fine. I was also surprised by the thought-out concept behind the B&B.I also liked a lot the type of B&B allowing you to see an architecture that is different from standard hotel chains. And not to forget the breakfast that is excellent, Since I was on business not enough time to enjoy.",positive
"Some negative: The breakfast area can be very crowded. The room is small. The cover of the bed is short (for tall guests). No coffee-tea facilities in the room.,

After I had settled in, I asked the front desk if there was anything to eat as I had not eaten since earlier in the day and I was told that they had saved a meal for me from the dinner meal which had been served earlier that evening.  The food was delicious and they even had a cold beer for me to go along with the meal.  I will definitely be staying at the OK Ogonek when I return to Belarus.",positive

"Staff at breakfast made us feel rushed even though we arrived 30 mins before breakfast was finished. We would recommend going earlier for breakfast as at that time there was limited selection as it was not being restocked. 
Light sleepers should be aware that the internal plumbing can be heard when the toilet is flushed/shower started. ,

Welcoming staff at the desk were lovely. Family room was a lovely size and split so that it felt like you had your own section. Lovely view of the river and parking directly opposite the hotel.",positive

"Although most of the room was clean, the floor in the room was filthy! There was muddy shoe prints and dirty footprints all over the place. I don’t think the floor was cleaned in the last few guests in that hotel when all it would need is a mop.
Also, there was no air conditioning in the room, only a fan. The fan would only give you cold air if you stood next to it , but not from lying in the bed as it has to stay at the front of the room with a plug. This made sleeping in 30 degree heat very uncomfortable and the room was so stuffy ,

The property was very close to the city , about a 5 minute walk to everything and most of the busses run from beside the hotel. 
The train station was also 2 minutes on a bus or 11 minutes walk.
We ate in the restaurant and the food was excellent. They have a 3 course menu with a drink for €20 for guests. 
The staff were lovely",positive

"We had a great stay in a very comfortable, self-catering chalet in Bloemenduin. We didn't want a busy park with late night entertainment this year (after staying in a bigger and noisier park last year) so we were delighted with the peaceful, friendly atmosphere . It is a small, quiet park with lovely staff and if you're looking for a great base from which to explore the Belgian coast its well worth a look.",positive
"The only one problem we had. Shower has no door)) so it was a little chilly to take shower and a lot of water was spreading around during any head washing...,

About 15 minutes' walk to the (free) shuttle boat going to the Ostend side of the harbour and about 20 minutes' walk to a long, beautiful and empty beach (Bredene).  Supermarkets (Carrefour/Lidl) are a short drive or about 15 minutes' walk.  Free and easy parking - we didn't need to use the car for our entire stay. Helpful owner provided maps and tips.",positive

Very friendy hostess!Very clean!",positive
Excellent WiFi.  24 hour bar. Good sized rooms. Superb staff. Close to the grand place square. Excellent hotel.,positive
"Everything was pretty good. I cannot point to something bad. Perhaps double check that the location is what you are looking for. While centric, nothing exciting nearby and we used the car for most of our activities.,

Breakfast was a nice surprise. The food was fresh; our kids loved it. I also found it pretty good bargain. While COVID, we were able to sit only outside. However, it was cosy and nice. Super well done.",positive

The breakfast, the view on the river, the food around",negative

"The apartment is big, cozy and really clean. It can easily accommodate a couple or small family and it includes everything that is necessary for a nice and comfortable stay.",positive
"There were no tea or coffee-making facilities in the room and a hot beverage at the bar was three euros. It would have been good to have this option to have a tea in our rooms with teabags bought from the supermarket at a lower expense,

Friendly staff and an amazing location nearby literally everything you would want to see or a metro stop that can take you there for less than a few euros. A 5 minutes walk down the road brings you to Grand Place and hundreds of restaurants and many many other main sights branch off of here. Breakfast at the hotel is also phenomenal so be sure to go down hungry and fill your boots.",positive

"We didn’t really meet the owner and we had to text him in french as he doesn’t speak English for getting or leaving the key. Also I have to admit that checking in at 15:00 is quite late so maybe the owner needs to rethink of that.,

It was close to Dinant’s centre and the studio was huge and clean with all the facilities. It accommodates 4 people for sure+ a baby.",positive
Good localisation for our purpose of visit.Anyway convinient bus connection to the city center.A lot of space; the only problem were hilly stairs to bathroom and master bedroom,positive

This is a fabulous apartment in a superb location. Accommodation is clean, spacious, bright and equipped with everything you need and it’s super close to lovely bars and restaurants , the free ferry to Oostend and exceptional beaches.

Would definitely stay here again.",positive

"The room was hot when we arrived, but we were given a fan straight away when we asked.  The room was on the ground floor so we didn’t feel that we could have the window open at night- It was very clean.,

"This location is on the new side of Ostend on the docks. You can reach the town by car. A tip, do not drive into town but use the Railway station parking at 1,5 euro per hour. It is brand new, easily accessible and avoids the drive into town. Alternatively take the boat across. The apartment is brand new, design, parking in front of the door (free). The extra bonus is that this lets you discover the dunes (Fort Napoleon), quiet extensive beach and pure nature of Bredene. At the end of the beach promenade on which you can cycle (free use of 2 bicycles) there is a surfers bar for food and drink. For kids, below the Fort Napoleon, there is a huge playground in the sand, the biggest I have ever seen.",positive

"Very bad experience in staying in this hotel! Not recommend to anyone!
I stayed here for 8 nights, I pre-paid at a time before my Europe trip in July 13, it’s expensive but thought it’s my birthday trip, I didn’t care much about the price. (I stayed in 4-5 starred hotels in my trip from Amsterdam. Rotterdam all the way to Antwerp Belgium) But the total experience with this Les Nuit turned out very unpleasant and even a nightmare.
Here are the stories, for the first 5 nights I was arranged in a dark green room, big bed is fine, like a museum with worn out & old facilities and so-so hygiene,
1. A worn out hairdryer with very awful screaming sound when powered on in the mid night in the empty “museum room”, imagine that. (changed after complain next day)
2. A Tiny shower room/stand without door (separate from toilet). Water splashed all the way outside the tiny shower room and became a big area of watered floor after showers although showered carefully; The small shower head never can sit still in the shower head holder. During the 5th day morning shower, it fell off the shower holder finally and like a sprinkler, water springs all the way up to the ceiling and to wardrobes in the room, my dry hair all wet! After reports to the staff, I got a better bright yellow colored-room instead with a glass doored shower room/stan and bath tub for the rest of my stay (3 nights)
3. The bath tub walls found dirty with skin dirt when trying to use it in the second room. Told them then they clean the next day!
4. Mosquitos found in Both rooms and biting during sleeps. Didn’t tell them but I left the dead big mosquito I killed in the room and stuck  on the tissue, and left on the glass table for them to see it at my last day!
5. Small flying bugs found at breakfast area and the seats are dirty with small pieces of food left over.
6. Last and the worst---bad, rude, arrogant and hostile  attitude of the woman staff who for check out service at my last day.,

Ok location for shopping but I not really into shopping , it needs around 20s min walk to the the central station and 15 min walk to the restaurant area",negative
"It was extremely dirty, we had spider webs in the room, sticky floor, stained decorative blanket, the towels provided had holes in them and what seemed like black mold on the sealing near the shower.",negative
"Quiet location, nice and cosy. Accommodating hosts who made us feel welcomed.",positive
"It has no AC, you are forced to open the window, but: the hotel is facing a very noisy main street, it's so much noise you won't be able to sleep (includes tractors passing and churches with their bells). I had the bad luck to be facing the street of the Sheep yearly festival here, with a mega loud party, drunk teenagers fighting next to the window at 3am, plus neighbors talking next to my window at 8am on a Sunday (with the window opened, otherwise it would be too hot).Our receptionist barely spoke English, but we kind of managed.You need a car to find a restaurant, and no regular buses pass by this small village,

Hotel has a very comfortable room with a good shower, very clean.bed was super comfortable. Parking next door is not a problem. Supermarkets close by, gas station as well",positive
"Location, comfort, hygiene",positive
"Perhaps the view from the window could be better :) But that's not a big deal.,

New hotel, clean and incredibly well located (100 m from the train station, but at the same time very quiet). Standard but sufficient breakfast (sweet and savoury). Free coffee/tea.",positive
"Cold temperature in the room. Little mould spots on the ceiling of the bathroom.,

Great location, near the city center",positive
"Everything is already written by the other reviewers:- something should be done with the navigation to the hotel: maps show an absolutely wrong address in the middle of the field. Uber driver didn't know where to go so we were looking for the hotel for almost one hour instead of 15 min drive and had to call to the reception twice. Needless to say that Uber doubled the ride price after that journey :)  If you are coming from the airport I would recommend taking the taxi offering transfer near the arrival gate - at least they know the location of the hotel.  - water smells and tastes with iron which is quite unpleasant.,

The hotel is located in a pine forest near the airport. Staff is friendly, they allowed me to arrive around midnight and organized transfer back to the airport. The price is very affordable, for less than $15 I got a triple room.",positive
"Needs private toilet ,

Interior is good. Staff are very friendly",positive
"The welcome and particularly the boss was not so nice and in bad mood.Matress and pillow are too strong, and there's some noise (probably from a fridge located outside or in the kitchen) in room 101.Nobody asked us if we were happy of the room and service during checkout...,

Perfect breakfast and the breakfast staff was very pleasent, particularly and old dame who was in charge or that task. The place is great and it is easy to park and eat something.",negative

Dinner was a little variety, but did okay. Bed is not perfect, but can’t complain. Very comfortable, I would stay there again and again.,

Comfortable, hot water, clean, Good value for money",positive
"The hotel's entrance was under construction.  There was no temporary sign, so we has a ask a construction worker how to get into the hotel.  There was construction noise that started shortly after 8am.  When we checked out and mentioned it to reception we were told that there was no construction happening at the hotel.  The hotel has closed there restaurant/bar/teraace.  There is basically only a breakfast room with a small reception desk and a small bar(not able to sit at it).  The rooms were very tired.  I have stayed there twice and have always enjoyed there property and have recommended it to other but will not be staying there again.  I was extremely disappointed!",negative
"The hotel lacks soul and the rooms and decor  are tired looking and outdated. Tile floors in the rooms make it cold and unpleasant. In fact, heating was off and the room freezing when we arrived, which definitely doesn't make for a welcoming feel. And about feeling welcome, there's a warning at every wall or in the lifts or at breakfast: hospitality does not in any way seem to be on the owners' /managers' minds at all. Towels are washed out grey or yellow, rather than white. The mattress felt like cardboard and foam blocks serve as pillows, preventing a good night's sleep. Breakfast was meagre with low quality cold cuts and cheese, old bread and a lady (owner?) shouting after you where stuff is, therefore not allowing for a quiet, relaxing breakfast (it's not included anyway, so you're better off going somewhere nice). Having travelled a lot, we had a laugh with how bad the hotel was and we only stayed 1 night, so it was doable. But it baffled us how a place like this can have 3 stars. ,

The hotel being situated on the river side, close to the cute old town really is it's only good point.",negative

"Twin bed room for a single man! Very soft matress ,

The staff, location and the bathroom was big and clean",positive
"We stayed in a budget room we twin beds. Our beds were very tiny it was hard to sleep both for myself (165 cm height) and for my 182 cm partner. It was also cold in the room but was ok after we got an additional small heater. The breakfast was so-so.,

Location is very near to the airport, so it was convenient for catching our early morning flight.",positive
"The room was not nearly as big as the booking.com site said it would be (about 21m2 and not 32m2) - so that made our two nights somewhat overpriced. We did not ask for another room, as we wanted to go out and have dinner, and the room though a lot smaller than expected, seemed fine enough.The loud music and the warmth at the breakfast room, apart from the price (€25,- pp) made us having our breakfast somewhere else.The air in the hotelroom was very dry, we had to drink water during the night not to get a very dry mouth.,

The warm welkome by the receptionist, who at 20:45 hrs, offered to book us a table at a nearby restaurant which prooved to be a very nice and warm welcoming one. The bed in our hotelroom and the shower, also were very good.",positive
"The pillows were a bit strange and uncomfortable - they seemed to be made of blocks of foam. The windows had to be propped open in order to let any air in (although being directly on the street was a bit noisy to have the windows open anyway). There was dirt in the corner of the room when we arrived, but otherwise the room and bathroom were clean. The bathroom had no window or exhaust fan (and also no candle or air freshener) and plumbing is very loud if you are a light sleeper. Plumbing can be heard also when other rooms shower or use the toilet. Also, the hairdryer did not function well and the water in the shower took about a minute and a half to finally become warm. The check in staff is a bit unfriendly and the website says they speak English, Spanish, French, and Dutch. We tried English, Dutch, and Spanish but only French was actually possible. The website also says checkout is 11:00am, but it is actually 10.30, which is quite early in our experience. Unfortunately, our room was one of the rooms that did not receive a wifi signal.,

The view was wonderful and the location was excellent. Overall, this is a very, very basic room in a great location on the river for a decent price during the summer high season. Free parking within 50-100m was a nice bonus.",negative
"Nothing!,

It is a quality hotel. The room was spacious and provided with good quality furnishings - and excellent towels. It was very good for a stopover and I will visit again when passing. It looks as if there are several walks through the Ardennes from the small town if you were stopping longer and it is close to Luxembourg for cheap fuel!!",positive
"It's quite a commercial hotel. Even though it is close to the central station, expect a trek to the hotel if walking there with heavy luggage. No tea/coffee making facilities in the hotel.,

The location is as central as it can get. The staff were also efficient. Best part has to be the 24x7 restaurant cum bar serving customers through out and possibly the only place in Brussels catering like this perhaps. The courtyard is great as well as the lobby.",positive
"Very new hotel. Clean, nice, confortable.",positive
"Bathroom very poor bath was under a sloping ceiling which means that the shower hose is unusable as you cannot stand and the water pressure is so low that it would take forever to fill the bath. ,

Good location, in old town and above underground car park. Good eating and drinking options nearby.",positive
"Nothing that I could think of.,

Great place to stay and relax. Very close to National Airport Minsk, the administrator of this place was very helpful and helped us with taxi both ways. There's a nice restaurant where we had a good dinner at pretty affordable prices. Very fresh & healthy air - the property is located in the pine forest. Very good experience overall! Highly recommended to stay especially when you have a layover in Minsk airport, as we did.",positive

"The room design was a bit idiosyncratic, shall we say -- there were no doors between the bedroom area and the bathroom, and in fact neither the shower nor the very small toilet(!) had a door. I'd never seen the latter and some couples (including us) might find it a bit off-putting. (Note: this may not be true of every room, I suppose.),

"Rooms felt generally tired and in need of updating. Nice design, but felt like it had been made using cheap materials. The bed sheet had a rip in it, the towels were small and didn’t smell fresh, the faucet was rusty and there was dust everywhere.

"Breakfast could be improved. Considering the price (10€) and the fact that the hotel has a restaurant kitchen, I was expecting something better. Not a big issue in any case, although a good breakfast would be important since there's not much around and the rooms do not have a frigobar.,

Good place to stay overnight or longer. The owner Massimo is very kind. Large and clean room (n.5), easy access to all you need. The hotel restaurant is good for lunch and dinner, not expensive at all. Parking is easy and free around the hotel. I do recommend.",positive

The problem is that it is a tourist-only building and the quiet time is not respected. This way we had hard nights to sleep.

we just got to dinner and we need to take a shower before bed",positive
"The table in the kitchen was not clean, lot of the facilities are very old. We had to pay 25 euros extra for the bedsheets. The soaps and shampoo that are in the room are old samples from other hotels that are not useable and dirty. So don't forget your bedsheets and your shampoo!,

A great host thank you! He met us on the street at 10pm and helped bring our things to the apartment. The property was so clean - absolutely spotless! It was a lovely little haven to enjoy at the end of the day. It had a very nice atmosphere with the mezzanine and with sweet bird and cherry decorations. He even left us some beers in the fridge which was a lovely welcoming touch. The photos don't do it justice!",positive
"A bit isolated. No air-con. Restaurant closed.Was not advised that there was a restaurant fairly close by if I  turned right out of the hotel.Instead I turned left into Asse but could not found anything until I made a large and time consuming detour and eventually found the restaurant I mentioned above.,

I cant say that there is much to like about the place.It's fairly clean and basic, but good enough for a one night stay.",negative

Anna was so kind to wait for us to check in as we hit a bit of traffic and took a wrong turn getting to the apartment (not the property fault).  Glad there was parking also!  The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for the weekend (even a washer and dryer downstairs). Loved the fact there was an elevator and we had a floor to ourselves especially when travelling with children. Spacious accommodations and safe area. Plenty of restaurants and grocery store within walking distance. There was documents provided on recommendations for restaurants and detailed instructions for the home. Will return here when coming to Brussels!",positive

Brilliant value for money, rooms are nice enough for the price and are clean. The hotel downstairs is very nice (looks like it has been refurbished) and the staff were outstanding. We had a glass of wine and have been given small bowls of crisps and cheese with each order which was a nice touch. We didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment.",positive

The bedroom has dark curtains but to the left and right a small stripe of light comes into the room. I personally like the curtains you find in some hotels which cover the wall with windows completely.,

Arnoud is a fantastic host. Very hospitable. I really liked the place. It has a separate kitchenette where I could cook my pasta. The beds were good (comfortable but not to soft). You have your own entrance. It was really clean and tidy.  The highway is very nearby, but inside with windows open you don't hear it. Real fresh eggs and juice for breakfast. Good suggestion for pizza delivery (actually Arnoud ordered it for me). And a very nice Orval beer after my run.",positive

The hospitality was really nice. Good looking building, never felt like a normal hotel. Loved the gesture from the staff gifting a hotel branded mug to all customers.",positive

Peronal was friendly and helpful. The room was clean. The location is just perfect.",positive

Cheap, works ok if you don't mind camping and you like a bath for a change",positive

Breakfast was good, the hotel has a really good quiet location. The staff were very nice and helpful to us! The room was clean, the beds were comfortable.",positive

The hotel is a palace in Place Fontainas, just besides the Moeder Lambic. So it's cool to crush there after some nice beer sessions. Staff is cheerful and gentle.",negative

breakfast was provided, but i was not hungry before i left. i decide to eat on route.",positive
"Typical Belgian breakfast. It could be a bit more varied. Besides, I have no remarks.,

Very nice staff at reception. Comfortable and well-furnished room. What is always important is a clean and spacious bathroom.",positive
I was amazed by the design and good management by the owners. The house is equipped with everything you need. And it is very cosy and relaxing.,positive
"Fortunately only spent one night at La Chaumiere. Am sorry to say that the negatives outweigh the positives. Arrived after a 600 km drive arrived only to find roadworks prevented access to hotel. Workmen suggested return 2 hrs later but finally after staff remonstrated with workmen we gained access to hotel. Had booked family room for 2 adults and 2 children. Attic room up 2 flights of stairs (no lift). One side of landing room contained Large double and single with small box room other side of landing and bathroom off. Rooms very clean but rather tired. Fortunately I was able to negotiate stairs despite being disabled, but anyone with greater disabilities or mobility issues would struggleThe restaurant menu was fine but not suitable for an 8 and 10 yr old. No child options. Having travelled to visit relatives we were OK as they took us to restaurants that had child friendly menu. The room was described as having tea and coffee making facilities and mini bar. Tea and coffee provided but no milk and minibar was an empty fridge barely cool. Single beds lumpy and more put you up that anything elseThe bathroom sink waste did not work so running water only and partially used toiletries were available with a pre-used (ie wet) face cloth (ugh). Towels were provided but again rather tired. The shower attachment in the bath barely did the job and useless. It felt as though room not prepared properlyBreakfast was very basic, however coffee was only available by the cup and had to be requested for refill. Despite 4 requests for hot water for tea non arrived.The hotel might be ok for a travelling rep but I would not rate it as the 3* rating. I have stayed in B&B in area at smaller cost. Perhaps the issue with the breakfast was due to a limited grasp of English or possibly because the staff had attention on breakfast tv. On the whole disappointing, not as described, and sorry  but when returning to area later in year will not be booking La Chaumiere.,

Not much",negative

The room was warm and cosy. The bed sheets were bit thin and i believe not that clean. But apart from the qualification of hotel. This hotel have the best receptionists in Brussel. So kind, warmhearted, understanding and helpful. Best of Brussel!",negative

Claudie is a great host and her place is quiet, clean, well stocked for eating in and is a 15 minute walk to old town or a short €2.50 euro bus fair. An Aldi supermarket is at the end of her short street. She sent very good instruction for getting to the rental. A bonus is that with the apartment’s set up you can get cross ventilation (wind movement) to control the temperature. I would stay with her again!",positive

"Nothing,  if complaining about this place must go to another and pay more,

Claudie is a perfect host,  good communication,  friendly,  helpful without being pushy. The location is quite perfect if you like to stay a bit outside city centre. .  Supermarket Aldi in about 300 m,  strolling  alongside the railtracks towards Namur railwaystation (1,5 kms)  you are close to the city centre as well.  Parking along the streets nearby tbe property is only 3 hours with blue parking card,  150 m further u have P+R Saint Nicolas,  combined parking and bus towards city centre for 2 or 3 euro full day. The room,  we were in was called Inez,  it was just enough for the 3 of us. Amenities OK.  People complaining about the noise here,  go away,  drive 20 kms more and stay in the woods and stay there lonely !!  We are very satisfied and look forward for a next stay !!  Merci Claudie et à la prochaine  !!",positive
"The hotel is tucked away at the top of a very narrow twisting lane but the room we had was right at the top of the building and it was virtually impossible to stand upright due to the sloping ceilings. The bathroom was shared but I knew that before booking.,

The peace and quiet and breakfast was nice but a typical continental one. You were able to use the coffee machine and kettle in the kitchen if you wanted a drink.",positive

"Arnoud is a friendly and welcoming host. The room was lovely and warm and a very comfortable bed. It’s on a lovely quiet road not far from Bastogne.

Bed was okay, happy with two extra pillows as standard  and there was a nice bath.",positive

"Just a couple of small things really; would have been nice to have had tea and coffee making facilities in the room.  Also a mirror over the desk in the room to do makeup would have been good instead of having to stand at the tall mirror! Felt the breakfast buffet option at €9.50 per person was very expensive and the bar prices for beer and gin again very expensive.  I know this is in keeping with prices in the city but really put us off spending any extra money with the hotel.,

The location was fab, no more than 8-10 min walk to the shops, bars and restaurants. Hotel was located in a fairly quiet location so didn't hear any noise from outside or other residents. On site car park was handy and secure, you do have to pay extra for this but was worth it knowing the car was in a safe place.  Plenty of lifts to all floors and although the hotel is big, never felt crowded or full.",positive
Excellent service good food,positive

Great value for money, friendly staff, easy underground parking, so close to everything in Antwerp",positive
"The only ""little"" thing is the tramline, it is just beside the hotel. The noise is not bad and it stops quite early in the evening and doesn't start really early in the morning. But you can hear it pass by, but bot much. So all in all, it didn't bother me, but I did notice it. But on the other hand, it is easy to get around, when you your tram pass by the hotel :),

Breakfast was fantastic as was the dinner menus that were offered during the weekend. There was a parking possibility available and I also could put my bikes in the garage of the hotel (possibility to charge your e-bike if needed)!",positive

4/ service in general + respect of COVID rules.",positive
"The hotel doesnt have a telefone in the room for a wake up call to be made. They had no adapter for international people that forgot it back home and need to charge their laptop and mobile. Most importantly, the sheets and quilts were not clean. I was scratching when my skin touched a bit the quilts. Moreover, the place is not sound proofed and eventhough i requested a room further back away from the lift, the noise was still evident, hearing people fighting and having sex. And also, the tv doesnt work well and there are 3 red lights that keep your eyes partly awake when there is complete darkness,

Its good to be in the centre of brussels, just next to restaurants and shops and close to the metro. Its also great to have an elevator and tv and breakfast availability. The staff are helpful and nice and ordered me taxi. They had good shampoo and wahsing liquids available.",negative

Everything was great. The bed was comfortable. The room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was a big buffet.",positive

The mattresses were too soft for our liking, but then again that is a personal preference.

Location is great, with a bit of luck you can get a parking spot on the Casino’s parking. But otherwise situated perfectly. 
Breakfast at the Nelson was good too.
Nice open plan apartment.",negative
Quick efficient checkin. Good value for money paid. Great room. Very close to St Pieters train station.,positive
No frills and very efficient. Location fab.,positive
"It would have been nice to have vegetarian options at breakfast. Dining in temporarily not possible. The internet connection was somewhat unstable (one of the rooms completely outside range).,

Great location, most beautiful scenery, the gardens are lovely. La maitresse-de-hotel friendly and accommodating - we found really great options to dine out at her recommendation.",negative
"It can be seen that the hotel is not new, it does not affect the comfort, but still. The ponds are very small and uncomfortable.,

Small hotel, looks old, better pictured than in real life. We stayed 1 night. For 1-2 nights this hotel is great, or if you are on a tight budget. If you are going on vacation, you better choose a more comfortable hotel. We liked everything, but it is clear that the hotel is already ""tired"". In any case, we were completely satisfied. The location is great and the staff are very friendly. The hotel is quiet, you can't hear the neighbors.",negative
"Excellent breakfast, clean rooms, super nice staff",positive
"The location was good, a few minutes walk from the Grand Place and the Manneken Pis but not very close to any metro station. The hotel room was a little bit expensive and you don’t get a free breakfast.,

The room was nice and comfortable, the staff were helpful, you have pretty much all you need",positive
"The stuff are too friendly, room are comfy and clean and the location is easy to reach and central",positive
"So expensive. Small room (not the same as the pictures).Good location next to the main station.",negative
"Small room, no fridge,

Friendly helpful staff, handy location, clean modern room",positive
"The floors a bit thin in the sense that if there are people in the room above you, you can hear them a bit.The TV is really an old model, but again if you go there it is not to watch the tv :),

Nice room and enough for one person, the bed was comfy enough, taking into account that i am 1m90. The decor is not very modern but still clean and the bathroom has a nice size. The bathtub is good enough also. Overall for the short stay i had there it was really nice",positive
👍🏼,positive
"We were expecting the cabin to be next to the water instead of right next to the entrance and the parking. ,

We loved the cabin, it was well equipped, clean and spacious. People working there were really nice and helpful.",positive
"Might have just been unlucky myself but the right shower handle was broken, so very little and only cold water. Due to timing couldn't ask to fix it or change room that same morning (when I tried to shower). 
There was no receptionist in the morning to check out so I just left the key on the desk as I needed to leave in a hurry.",negative
"For the breakfast, there were eggs and bacon, but saucages would have been nice. There was a fruit salad, but in really top-rated hotels one would also find slices of water melon; the frequent tramway passing at the street is an advantage for the location, but a disadvantage for the noise.,

Extended breakfast buffet with cereals, wide variety of bread and toppings; clean room with complementary bottle of water; very good location near the sea side.",positive
"The rooms were extremely small and cramped. 2 people in a room is pushing it. The bathroom was acceptable but the shower tended to leak everywhere. The rooms were clean upon arrival. ,

The location was good, close to Grand-Place and easily accessible via the 3/4 line of the Brussels tram",negative
"Nothing,

The HYGGE hotel can definitely be a home away from home. My stay there has been perfect: the room was spacious, incredibly clean and plenty of all accessories I needed. The staff (present 24/7 at the reception) has been super friendly and available for any request I had. The hotel itself has a great hygge style and the location is just perfect: right in the heart of Ixelles, near to all nicest spots of the city (by 10-15 mins by walking) and well connected. Once I’ll return to Brussels I’ll definitely stay at the HYGGE hotel again. I thank all the staff for the great stay I had.",positive
"An electric kettle would have been a great addition else everything else was super+,

Location was great , a super market across the road,  Paul's at one end, a 10 min walk to grand place! The location was ideal . U weren't in the bust noisy centre yet a hop and a skip away to all the action!",positive
"Large room, excellent breakfast, helpful staff. Appropriate COVID measures were in place. Thank you!",positive
"Bothering from one receptionist about the masks, panic and spreading rummors of covid situation as a dramatic,

Terrace in front hotel",negative
Nice place at the River. Nice cottage.,positive
"The room was a bit noisy - I could hear people in the other rooms and in the streets.,

The room was comfortable and cozy, even better than I expected. The staff was very friendly and the location also did not disappoint! :) Very happy they made an exception and let me check-in before 3pm. Overall good value for money! I'd stay there again!",positive
"The room was very hot due to very good weather and the duvet on the bed was too much. Would it be possible to have the option of a sheet in very hot weather?,

Having a private parking was a plus and the location, 50 metres from the beach was excellent. Our room was small but very clean and the level of cleanliness and anti-virus procedure in the hotel was great. The young lady who checked us in and out of the hotel was very friendly. Breakfast was very good in a very pleasant room.",positive
"Our room was in front of main street so it was very noisy. We did need to use ear plugs in order to sleep good. Our bed was supposed to be a big one but instead it was two single ones placed next to each other, which start to separate every time you move. The sink in the bath was very small, so every time you have to wash the water was streaming down the floor.,

The location was just perfect. It was on a walking distance from most major attractions in the city. There are plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops nearby. It is also very convenient to go back there after walk in order to take a little break and continue. The room was clean and looked pretty much the same as on the pictures.",positive
"Beautiful and quiet, great location. Friendly staff.",positive
"Rooms were clean, but in need of a refresh.,

Restaurant Les Caves du Chateau was very good.  Dinner was delicious and breakfast was a great way to start a busy day.  The owners/managers were very friendly and helpful.  Bathroom was large with good heating.  Bedroom decorations could use a refresh, but the chateau has lots of character and is located in a small, picturesque village in the centre of the beautiful Ourthe River valley.",negative
"The carpet had a stain and the breakfast wasn't what we'd expected. There was also some miscommunication when picking up our breakfast in the morning. That was a bit unfortunate. ,

The beds were very comfortable and the shower was excellent. There was enough parking.",positive
"It’s called international but lots of instructions and orders, none in English. Was shouted at by a cleaner for my little one using the toilet when she was cleaning it but I had no idea what the sign she had put up said.  Very loud karaoke on until late at night. ,

Location wise, it was beautiful.",negative
"The shower did not have hot water, unless you turned it on for 10 minutes. The employee told us this was because the hotel was almost empty.
We booked a room with a double bed (2 person), but got 2 single bed with a double mattress on top, and two single bed covers. Not really romantic.
We woke up a few time at night, because of staff shouting and slamming doors.
We had to pay an additional fee of 5 euros for city tax, which we were not aware of. ,

The hotel is located in the city centre and the central station is just a 5 minute walk. The employee at the desk was friendly.",negative
"The breakfast-buffet has to be organised in a 'coronaproof' way. So be it, no problems with that. One female member of the staff behaved as the client were toddlers: six - six!! - of us got a very loud, public scolding because we 'sinned' to a detail of the very vast set of rules. Me too. It was not intended, and in no way - no way, even not covid - I appreciate it to be reprimanded as a client, loud and clear, by a member of the staff - just because I touched my piece of bread in a way that she didn't liked. A breakfast is the start of the day. It should be joyfull. (The others members of the staff ware very, very kindly - I want to stress it. But these one person was in charge of the organisation of the buffet, so she was important. And and she behaved like an old-school nun towards kids who had to obey, and nothing more.,

Good rooms. Friendly staff (one exception). Very good location. Excellent 'value for money'.",positive
"very small room; very little light and fresh air, the window exiting in an interior space; no space for luggage,

Position, cleanliness, elevator, renovated",negative
"I didn’t like that the the 5th floor did not have AC and it’s not advertised on website that only certain rooms have it. Because we got there in the middle of the day and the room was smothering hot! Also rooms don’t have a fridge we had things we need to put in fridge. But the staff was nice and let us use the hotel fridge. Oh and the shower although very beautiful is like a death trap. When it gets wet it’s super slippery and hard to stand on. Had to put a towel on the inside of the shower to avoid busting my whole body on the ground.,

Love the location very close to many restaurants and shopping area for high end fashion. The hot very clean and the decor was pleasant to look at. The staff was very helpful & friendly.",positive
The restaurant provided really nice food and excellent service.,positive
"Loved almost everything there,

Everything was perfect. And I will always choose this particular hotel whenever I want to relax from home. Big ups guys. U always have my recommendations. Keep going",positive
"Read the description more carefully. This was my first time in 8 years using booking.com that there was a charge for bedding. I saw no price listed in the description, so I overlooked this fact. Apparently, this is a common practice in the Ardennes. That said, the staff were understanding and helped us out and made us feel welcomed.,

Beautiful setting along the river. We made use of the kitchen and felt like we were at home. Staff was friendly and welcoming. With the windows closed, it was silent inside.",positive

"Very friendly check in, hotel in a great location for the lovely beach. Coffee/tea facilities in bedroom.  Very clean and breakfast very good.  Super friendly staff.  Would stay again.",positive
"The room is old and the facilities are kind of broken. It’s newly painted so the room is full of the bad smell of paint, which really made us uncomfortable. The most important, the hotel may not be clean. All of us got herpes on our body especially on feet, hands and arm. This really annoyed us.,

The location is pretty good, really in the city center, close to many attractions. All the staffs are nice, polite and willing to offer help.",negative

Friendly and helpful staff, comfortable bed and good showers.  Excellent location.",negative

Great design, lovely communal spaces, very nice breakfast",positive
"Absolutely nothing,

Self catering with a fully equipped kitchen. Supermarket within walking distance. Very clean and comfortable.",positive
"Parking not accessible after reception closes. Leading to paid street parking. Despite calling and checking if the third bed was a real full on bed it turned out to be a foldable bed after all. That was most disappointing. There were quite some musquitos but as the walls were dark coloured it was impossible to chase them down. Room comfort was alright but less than expected.,

Great breakfast. Served at the table.",positive

Water in the bathroom was almost cold, tv was not working, air condition did not have a remote, so it was not possible to adjust it.
Rather expensive. ,

Comfortable beds, possibility of paid parking.",negative
"Lift was tiny and shuddered, a bit worrying.,

Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was superb.",positive
"The radiator took quite a while to start warming up the room and since the temperature was very low, we were cold for a while; that could have been remedied.,

The location is perfect, it is very much in the city centre. So it's great to access all the sights around there. It's a cozy place and is value for money",positive

Very hospitable personell. Quiet yet central location. Nice size on the room. OK breakfast.,positive

This was our second visit to the Ambassador - it's ideally placed for travel to/from UK via the channel tunnel. First-class breakfast, great location close to seafront, secure parking and a warm welcome. Restaurant was closed on the evening of our stay but the owner directrd us to an Italian restaurant on the promenade. We'll be back next time we visit Belgium!",positive
"good location, friendly staff, realistic price",negative
"The place is incredibly beautiful. Once you enter the hotel reception, you just want to take photos of everything. The staff is very nice and helpful. I stayed at the hotel for my boyfriend’s birthday, and they ask me if I wanted to let a birthday card at our arrival. It’s a little detail that makes all the difference for me.",positive
"Window blinds aren't thick enough to make a complete dark at night,

Clean, well kept and modern. Rooms are small and with basic furniture but with nice tv set and the bathroom is nice and recently renovated.",positive
"Our room was on the 1st floor (no elevator), which was not ideal since we visited with our toddler and had a stroller. Wish we would have been assigned a ground floor room instead. ,

Nice room, friendly staff, great food and beer. 
Loved the beer vending machine. Tasty breakfast! 
It takes about 10 min to walk to the city center. 
Easy parking across the street for 5 Euros per day
Would stay here again for sure!",positive
The accommodation was excellent and very stylish. Everything was perfect would recommend to anyone,positive
"Breakfast wasn’t too great, but in light of restrictions during my stay it was ok,

Hotel staff were very helpful, efficient and friendly.",positive
"All was great , but I expected a nicely furnished room room . The TV set is very small.,

The bathroom is large and very clean, beautifully decorated  ( better than the room itself)
The breakfast is exceptional,  with home made  products and fresh croissants . 
The wines could be tasted from the own cellar in a cosy ambience.",positive
"Nb This was the Novotel next to the Ibis). Long hall walk from elevator to room. The queen size mattress was no longer even. The carpet had spots on it. The breakfast was a not very interesting corona-takeout with mostly sweet stuff. The worst thing was that my styling tool did not work in the shaving-only plug in the bathroom. It worked in another plug, but there was no mirror. Very useless for a woman who likes to style her hair.,

(Nb.This was the Novotel, next to the Ibis that was closed due to the corona.) Parking, checking in, elevator to floor was a short excursion. The room was spacious, well designed and practical. There were some nice toiletries present, and the towels were good. The restaurant/bar area is spacious and light with a wall of windows onto the terrace. The terrace and its little outdoor bar is equally open en comfortable. The large, enclosed garden with nice green gras, shrubs and trees surrounding a large pool with poolside seating is a beautiful paradise in the industrial area. The cocktails are generous and the food is really good. TV channels included Classic 21 and Arrow radio.",positive

Lovely rooms and great hosts. Perfect place if you visit the circuit or want to relax. There was enough parking and the Wifi was working great. Really enjoyed my stay!,positive
"The air system of the spa bathtub wasn't working. No coffee machine or boiler in the room. It was stated in the room description that some soft drinks will be available in the fridge but there was nothing. The TV offered very limited channels selection. ,

The room is amazing and very spacious. The steam shower was very relaxing. The bed was comfortable. We appreciated the late check-out at 12h.",positive
"Room, Breakfast and location all exceeded our expectations!",positive
"The property was quite far out from the city centre and restaurants and other shops, etc. Public transport in the area was often unreliable but that’s not the properties fault. ,

The staff were incredible. Could not fault them what so ever. We had to cut our stay short due to needing to head home to Australia early because of COVID-19 outbreak. The staff helped us so much with anything they could to make our experience better. Thank you! 
Also- Our first room had a broken window, they moved us straight away. The rooms were clean and tidy.",positive

It is very nice people, very kind and helpful...",positive

Location: a 7-min walk to the Grande Place",positive

Very warm welcome, spotless clean and overwhelming breakfast",positive
"- Our door was knocked by the cleaning lady for cleaning 3 hours before our check out, which was a bit annoying.- Shower has a window to separate the shower area from the sink, but no doors included. Once you start showering it is highly possible that you will end up with a wet floor- A small fridge/bar in the room would be a nice addition (it is not a negative thing but yet would be nice)- No tea/coffee in the room, and no water boiler,

- Helpful reception staff- Air conditining- Comfortable room- Easy access to the rooms- Very good location: 2 mins to the Royal Palace of Brussels and 10 mins to the center by walking- It was very nice for us to be able to check in earlier than what is mentioned on the website. (we checked in 30 mins earlier)",positive
"The bedroom door is the outer door to the courtyard so can be noisy with people standing around smoking and chatting.,

A non-typical room design which makes a difference when you travel as much as I do. A comfortable and big bed also makes a great difference! Very nice.",positive
"Latest standard rooms, all new. Very friendly owners. Best breakfast. 
A perfect choice",positive
"AC wasn't heating the room more than 20.4 degrees and that's cold sadly. Took 2h to heat from 20 to 20.4.
Other than that all ok. ,

Spacious room, next to airport. Fast check inn and out.",positive
"Smell of smoke inside (in all rooms incl. entrance, hallways and restaurant). Dusty surfaces everywhere, unclean floors. Shabby and dirty bedlinen and furniture in rooms. All of this is not in line with the price for the stay.,

Old couple run the place, they are friendly.",negative
"The rooms were as expected, but a bit over time, which you could der in furniture. 
The hotel is outside the City, which wasnt a big Deal , so WE could save City Car Tax, but a huge Problem was the Public Transport. The Bus fromm hotel is only every hour, the Tram about 2km feetwalk. ,

Late Checkout on sunday Till 5 pm., Good price, helpful stuff.",negative
"It wasn't possible to turn off the air condition. A very little negative part about the breakfast were the scrambled eggs, which didn't taste quite fresh, but were still eatable.,

Nice room, it very clean and quiet. The breakfast was very good and the stuff was friendly. So everything a hotel needs:D",positive
buffet excellent,positive
"The bed was quite uncomfortable, it was a little too cold and for the price it was surprisingly cramped.,

It was very close to the centre, to transport and to amenities.  No food being served or access to coffee/tea was a little drawback.  The staff were friendly and the place clean.",positive
I had a wonderful experience. The staff was extremely helpful. The room is nice and quiet. Slept really well. Really cute bathroom. I liked also the breakfast (15EUR). Perfect location. The hotel is at the corner of the Apple store between Porte de Namur and Louise. I’ll definitely come back.,positive
"As a couple we had not expected to have beds at separate ends of a large room. Neither of us found the beds or pillows comfortable and we slept badly. The room is slightly strangely laid out with desks each end and lots of chairs which made it feel cluttered.,

The host could not have been kinder or more welcoming. We were able to sit in the large garden which was nice.The location was good right near the tram stop – save that coming home at night there was a long wait for trams, one hour on one occasion.",positive
"Not particular,

Staff are very friendly and helpful especially the one with long hair (name forgotten). He was patient and helpful.",positive
"Nothing!,

Really pleasant experience",positive
"TV was not working properly as ""snowy"" picture but didn't bother me really. Room doors could be isolated better as you hear every move of other guests in the annex where the guest rooms are.,

Ideal for a race weekend as only 12 Minutes by car away from the track. Friendly hosts,clean and charming rooms, quiet outside and enough free parking. A nice little hidden gem if you are in the region.",positive

"If at all - The roads leading to the place were a bit rough for low cars and people on foot a bit long walk to the track,

It was really nicely furnished. It was clean and comfortable. It was cosy. The breakfast was delicious with different croissants, fresh berries, cocoa etc. The surroundings were really cosy. The host was willing to drop us bystanders to the track.",positive
"Not enough pillows in the room ,

Super comfortable bed",negative
"That I didn't write down the names of our hosts so that I could thank them directly here again. I didn't like that I won't be there in the later spring or summer to see what the grounds will look like when they are in bloom.,

One of the best things about Le Château de Rendeux is that it has no wifi. For the duration of the visit you will be compelled to enjoy whose-ever company you may be in and you will be forced to enjoy unbearably good hospitality.We were the only guests during our stay and enjoyed one of the finest meals of our lives, attentively prepared, and paired with a marvelous wine which was recommended by our host. Breakfast was also superb. All was interspersed with engaging conversation in broken French and English.",positive

Parking,positive
Excellent hotel. Location was fabulous and the room was very stylish and comfortable! Staff were very helpful and friendly,positive
"Room a little bit cold in the arrival. It takes some time to be heated.,

It´s a nice hotel inside a brewery factory.Quite new romos with a nice design.The brasery restaurant it´s also really nice. Really recommended hotel to stay.",positive
"Given there was nowhere to buy any food from within 3km of this location it would have been handy to have a few more groceries for breakfast stocked in the room for arrival such as bread, milk, cheese, juice etc. No ATMs at all in the local village and lots of places only take cash. This needs to be made clearer in the information provided to guests. We had to return to pay the tax in cash after driving to a bigger town to get money out. Not sure why credit card would not be accepted and in this modern age the property should take credit cards.,

The host Angelique and her husband were brilliant. Very friendly. Very proud of the obvious hard work they put into modernising their property. Excellent kitchen facilities with high quality crockery and cutlery. Brill stereo, TV and DVD player on the top floor. The kids loved their own 'space' with beds made kid-friendly style by the hosts. Lots of kids books and DVDs available. Beds very comfortable. Amazing rainfall shower. Very modern facilities from blinds to upholstery to bedding. Can definitely tell that a personal touch was added. The hosts left a few bottles of water and some tea and coffee for us o arrival. 5 miles from the town of Spa which is quite charming. Lots of animals to spot. We could have easily stayed for another three nights. The children did not want to leave their 'penthouse'! Thank you for an amazing stay.",positive

"Shame breakfast isn't included. No cooked options.,

Motel One has been newly refurbished. Rooms are very small but clean and modern and perfectly acceptable. They come with a useful desk. The room would be small for two but is perfectly adequate for one. There is no enclosed hanging space. Great bar area. Nice enclosed courtyard garden outside to sit out in when the weather is fine. Breakfast is busy but the buffet is well-stocked.",positive
Great location and marvellous staff. Very comfortable and a really atmospheric restaurant. Brewery tour a must.,positive
"I could not find the bus  from the airport to the hotel, so took a taxi for 15 Euros. Found out that restaurant is closed, room service prices were outrageously expensive; and that they were giving breakfast food boxes: croissant, juice and coffee for 20 Euros. I thought I already paid for food with lodging, but was told that this was not so. Ate at the airport for 7 Euro with coffee!,

Nice spacious room and fairly large bathroom. Great coffee in the morning from the expresso machine.",negative

"The wifi was slow, could be the location of the room,

The room was upgraded, a very nice room where I was able to work and relax. Paring was great, I has a spot in front of the entrance.",positive
"The shower is literally in the bedroom. It's beside your bed and there's a hole in the bathroom, if you are not careful the water will splash to your room.
The location isn't exactly in Antwerp, best if you are bring a car because the parking lot is huge.,

Free Bathroom Amenities and Towel, rarely found in Budget Hotel.
Staff is really nice. The Wi-Fi is enough too.",positive

Staying here is a must for beer lovers. All their beers are awesome,positive
"Food - had dinner at the restaurant - Friendly and polite staff but  Extremely disappointed with the quality of the pasta dish served. Rare to be told that the restaurant does not have or serve any spicy sauce such as tabasco or any basic Italian chilly sauce; the garlic they use is not really fresh garlic.... its some kind of dried,

Extremely polite and professional staff right from check in to check out",positive
"Just good,

It is 300 meters from my office, Free parking",positive

the bathroom was nice and clean and the hotel was very central",negative
"The room was really small, the heating didn’t work at all, so had to ask the receptionist to bring additional blanket, then it worked. TV didn’t work either, but it’s not a big deal,

The location couldn’t be better! Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. All the men at the reception were nice and very helpful.",positive

very good value for the money",positive
"Easy check-in, friendly staff, convenient on site free parking",positive
"Wifi, TV, and heating were all not working inside my room in the 4th floor. No telephone or intercom. You have to take the lift back and forth just to ask something at the reception (e.g. Wifi password, breakfast time, etc. - as they don’t proactively give you this information). Reception staff could be better. ,

A few minute walk to the Mannekin Pis and Grand Place, 10-15 minutes to Brussels Central and there are many restaurant options around the area. Clean room and functional toilet and bath. Breakfast was okay for the 5 euro extra.",positive
Friendly staff,positive
"Nothing,

Great breakfast with everything",positive
"No hot waterDriver for shuttle bus didn’t turn up.First shuttle is at 6am - would be great if a breakfast of some kind could open at say 5:30am for those wanting to catch the 6am shuttle,

Cleanliness of hotel and friendliness and helpfulness of staff at front desk",positive
"Beds are a tad too hard but still OK for a few nights. The ventilation ran all night which was rather noisy and we could hear other rooms partying through it. Room didn't heat up very well. Could have been a defect in our room only though.,

Price was very good and the all-you-can-eat restaurant nextdoor was excellent.",negative
"The room was quite small but it didn't really bother me. Also note that there is no wardrobe (but the space is used really well and you can hang your clothes on hangers by the entrance to the room or behind the bed.,

Absolutely beautiful interior, friendly staff and oh so comfortable bed! I loved this hotel, very good location, pretty much everything is in a walking distance from the hotel. Would definitely recommend this and if I come to Brussels again, I would be more than happy to stay there again!",positive

I liked the rooms very clean",positive
The room was very clean and the hotel is really close to the central station and to the city. I would definitely recommend,positive
"This hotel was used as a stopover point when travelling through Belgium on the first night of our holiday.  Easy to find, lovely large rooms in the old brewery buildings and a lovely restaurant for dinner and breakfast.  Ideal after a long day of travelling.  Parking onsite, which needs reserving, within a secure car park.   This is still a working brewery so it was a bit of  unique venue, would use again.",positive
Clean and close to the airport,positive
Nothing to complain about,positive
"Our room was by the entrance and because there it was a beer dispensing machine in the lounge, every 30 seconds it made a lound bang! I didn`t sleep all night because of this, very very annoying! Plus all the people coming in from town very late into the night, shouting and beeing very loud. Not saying about the people smoking by the door with the door open and the smoke coming into the room, as there it was a bit of a gap betwen the door and the floor.,

Loved the quirkiness of this little hotel and also the great food they serve in their restaurant! Not talking about the beer, a must try!",positive
"A long way to the lobby and some minor defects in the room such as broken lamp shade.,

Rooms were stylish clean and quite large.",negative
"The one thing I didn’t like was it would have been great if there was shampoo and conditioner we were only on a city break so you can’t bring them with you for your liquids in the airport that would be the only thing that would have been great if it was provided.,

Loved the location of the hotel! Also the bed and bathroom was lovely and comfy ! We also were on the 6th floor and the big window that opened to the door was lovely to just sit and read a book! The breakfast was very nice lovely coffee and healthy granola which was great",positive
"Nothing to really dislike, but parking could be little bigger.,

The location, rooms and staff are amazing! Our dog was also welcome. Excellent food in adjacent restaurant, and beer fresh from the brewery 😀
By far the best hotel for discovering authentic Mechelen. City centre is a 5 minute walk away and is amazing!",positive
"When I say that the light is bouncing in my room, don’t say « no I verified. No ». I’m not hallucinating...,

The speaker; that’s amazing! Also as the bed.",negative

The hotel is clean and new. The bathroom was really comfortable and super clean. Also the location is perfect, very near to many restaurants.",positive
"Heating set a little high at night though we probably could have changed it if we’d thought before going to bed. No tea or coffee making facilities in room. ,

Lovey quirky and stylish hotel and a good location. Excellent breakfast. Amazing bathroom with best water pressure and heating accuracy I’ve known! Bath too which you often don’t get. Excellent breakfast.",positive
"Breakfast wasn't included in the price, opposed as to how it's listed on this site. Tax at check out is a bit steep, but not the fault of the hotel.,

The private parking (free) included is wonderful, since anywhere else you have to pay. All of Durbuy is within walking distance, even the kayak departure is. Breakfast includes fresh croissant, pistolet (round bread roll) and pain au chocolat.",positive

Bad rooms and bad breakfast,negative
"I did a booking and choose a single room with twin bed, as you can prove and shows in my booking confirmation, for my surprise the hotel gave me a terrible room, with a really small single bed (I even took pictures, was ridiculous!), in which I could not move for not to fall, it has been a scam, I have claimed the hotel and they have not cared in the least. If a claim were possible through you I would appreciate it, because I feel you have been robbed, what booking.com offered me and for what I paid was not what I received,

The staff was very friendly and it had a good location!",positive
"NA,

Friendly staff, you feel most welcome.",positive
"Location was part of the Het Anker Brewary. Rooms were quite poor and very noisy. No power point in the bathroom, no shelf in the shower and cheap coffee packets in a glass! Breakfast was reasonable. We had issues (twice) with blown circuit breakers (turned out to be a shorting kettle) and parking boom gate failure. WiFi dropped out regularly,

Breakfast was reasonable",negative

"Not a fantastic sound isolation, you hear neighbours and the street quite a lot. But that's ok.,

Friendly personnel",negative
"The water pressure and temperature were very temperamental and made it unpleasant to shower. The boiled eggs were very cold at breakfast, were they kept in the fridge overnight?,

A cosy, clean, modern and simple bedroom providing all the basic needs.  It was pleasantly quiet, beds are comfy.  A good variety on offer at breakfast buffet.",positive
"Bed was hard as a rock, pillows were extremely lofty so hard to use without hurting neck. TV didnt work",negative

Wifi doesnt work in the room only in the restaurant due to poor reception.

Creative design and the world famous brewery is at your doorstep",negative

Very friendly and helpful owner. Restaurants were closed, made us dinner. All local and fresh products for breakfast. Just great place.",positive
"Fantastic B&B with beautiful rooms, incredible breakfast and lovely hosts. It was a wonderful weekend and we will surely be back. This is a little gem and we were lucky to discover it. The nature around is beautiful.",positive
"my only problem with this hotel is its location, too far away from the city of Antwerp. Also, i had a problem with a taxi that never came to pick me up on Sunday night, and i cancelled it after 20 minutes of waiting and stayed in my room instead of going out,

comfortable and friendly staff",negative

Really clean, comfortable and beautiful rooms and bathrooms. Uncomplicated check in and check out. Very friendly and warm staff.",positive
Simple breakfast.,positive
"Full cost taken over 2 months before arrival with no option given at that point to cancel! No real effort made to re-market a room in our booking that became ‘spare’ until it was too late. Poor response was blamed on language, which was not acceptable. This spoilt the stay for us as it was very expensive and no rebate was offered or given. We will not return because of this. Shame ..,

Very close to the circuit (10 min walk) and convenient if not a little sterile reception, as everything is automated. There are no visible staff! Clean, efficient and effective. Good breakfast too. Parking was complicated, but great to have and very private.",negative
"Very nice, newly renovated. Very pleasant reception and stay.",positive

The most friendly and smiling staff I ever meet. Only few things available during breakfast, but their quality was excellent.",positive

Small but functional room, sleep fun design, closeness to the airport",positive
"The room felt rather cold.  It was different from the time we stayed here before, it was renovated but it has lost its character. There were other issues about which I am now in contact directly with the Hotel and I am waiting for their response.,

A nice concept staying in a working brewery with a bar/restaurant within walking distance of the city centre. Het Anker also offers breakfast in the morning which is included in the price.",negative
"My room didn't have real window, it was pointed to emergency shaft. So no light and it was smelly.",negative
"The room was next to the elevator and it was pretty noisy every time someone used it (a lot of banging noises, old elevator).No hairdryer.Rooms could be cleaner.,

The location of the hotel is great, just minutes away from Central Station, close to everything. The staff was nice and friendly, easy check-in and check-out.",negative

Very good breakfast with local products from the Ardennes. Ideal location by the river, near the forest paths and close to the restaurants and the 2 streets of the town :) Nathalie was genuinly kind ant very patient with our 3 year-old son. Impeccable room, ideal location for a family with kids. In spring or summer time it`s even better as the hotel has a terrace and playground for children. Perfect also for those interested in kayaking or trekking as both the river and the forest are at the doorstep, literally.",positive

"Excellent breakfasts, Nicole excellent host, very close (8 km) to Maastricht",positive
"I am frustrated with them reserving 90% of the night's cost and requiring to pay the full amount at the till. It takes my bank 10 business days to release the funds. This never happened to me before. I think that the thermostat in my room didn't work, but I could freely open the window.,

Clean bathroom, bed size and the personnel is friendly enough. The price is adequate.",negative

There was a big restaurant just next 2 the hotel.
So easy to grab a bite",positive

Great location",positive
"see above. should be fairly self explanatory,

The walls were exceptionally thin and could pretty much follow the conversation of my neighbours on either side of my room.Too much light coming through the gap / curtainsOtherwise it was a decent 3-star hotel. Staff very friendly, bar was nice.Too bad I couldn't do a tour of the brewery.",negative
"-,

It is located in the centre of Brussels, close to the important touristic attractions. It s clean, and the personnel is very nice and friendly.",positive
"Rooms very simple, not very comfortable but functional, lack of decoration or any additional details. The view from the room was not very nice, an ugly office building or something like this.,

For the price we payed the room was quite basic, we were expecting a higher standard. Everything quite simple, but clean and ok for one night. The area was nothing special but for us it was important to stay not far from the bus and train station and for this the location was perfect. The breakfast was ok and we could leave our luggage in the hotel after check-out.",positive
"We had single beds and also the shower was too powerful to face down and could therefore only be held in hand,

Beautiful cozy hotel with a lovely vibe. The colours and décor are all calming and very modern. Loved the area of the hotel great restaurants nearby and accessible to everywhere but a bit of the tourist trap",positive
The bathroom was rather small although we had a suite.,positive

"Room was a little small- we both had quite big bags and was difficult to manage when in the room!,

Hotel was super cross to the train station and the main shopping street- however as he city is quite small it was pretty easy to walk anywhere. The rooms are basic, similar to a travel lodge in the UK. Everything is clean and bed was comfy.",positive
"Location,",positive
"Bed mattress was softer than I prefer, however it was still comfortable and we had a good nights sleep.,

"You have to go outside to get to the breakfast area & check in. No common areas or facilities. Restaurant closed except for breakfast.,

Well-decorated, clean room. Good breakfast. In the centre of Francorchamps close to restaurants and the racetrack. Free parking at the back but it is easy to park on the street in front of the hotel. Wifi is fast enough to stream formula 1!",positive
Perfect location,positive

Spacious, fully equipped, clean and the owner is very responsive. Excellent place",positive
"Cant really fault anything. The extractor fan in the bathroom wasn't working so I informed the host. But this did not effect our stay.,

Location was near to Town and we could hear Music going on but not enough to stop us sleeping or ruin the stay. We were too tired from our day to venture into town but it did look like there was some night life going on. The apartment had everything we needed. We didnt see our hosts but they did message us to check everything was ok. They were very helpful and easy to contact. The description they gave us was perfect we knew where to park etc. The price was perfect. We tried to find a hotel to stay in and this worked out cheaper for us than hotel rooms. It was perfect. Tea & coffee, Towels, kitchen fully equipped . Shampoo & shower gel supplied. Recycling bins, DVDs to watch,Tv easy to use, air conditioning ( we didnt need this ) Host even offered us the use of their pool in their garden but unfortunately we were too busy to use it.",positive
Beautiful place to stay with a great breakfast!,positive
"The master bedroom window was at at inner air duct and the vents were quite noisy.The chair in the dining/kitchen were really old, used and torn. The appartement was not updated for a few years, but was clean.,

easy and safe access ; description to enter was good. Location in the center and garage parking within 100m was perfect. The beds were all Cocomat brand with different hardness - perfect to try. Building first floor is a good hamburger place and we were hungry - super in Corona times.",negative

Style and location",positive
Wonderful place! We'll come back again for sure.,positive
"We arrived after midnight, we booked a room for 2 person, but we got a single room only, one towel, one blanket.... Was not so comfortable. We called the reception, but nothing happened, we just got a sorry in morning.",negative
"The room was non-smoking, however when wr arrived in the room the smell of sigarettes was like someone just smoked there 5 minutes ago. I was with a child of 3 years so i really didnt like that.. but for the price we paid i cannot complain",positive

"No thing ,

I Like Mr. Dirk, very nice man who take care for his guests. 
The apartment was really beyond my expectation.
It was very organized and clean.
Full kitchen with all tools of cooking. 
Apartment was fully equipped.
I strongly recommend any one to book it.
Sure if I back to Brussels I will book again.",positive
"Nice property in a nice neighborhood, and very professional people taking care of it. I was there with my daughter, and we felt at home. Can only recommend!",positive
"the apartment is very spacious and clean only with the detail that they claim to be two rooms and it is only one. Also counting not being able to enjoy the internet on the upper floor, thanking the attention given, I am still pleasantly pleased with its facilities",negative
"Nothing could have been better.,

The decor was utter luxury whilst also being homely & comfortable. The breakfast was so lovely that I - a non breakfast eater, even on holiday - stuffed my greedy little face! How could I not, when presented with such an array of goodies; a fruit bowl including pieces of kiwi & passionfruit, yoghurt & granola, scrambled eggs, toast, waffles, danish pasties, a cheeseboard, cold cuts of meat, little bars of chocolate, cereals, tea, fresh coffee, fruit juice and bread rolls. We were offered a glass of champagne but unfortunately I was too hungover to consider it. I can not recommend this lovely hotel highly enough.",positive

Wonderful spacious and clean apartment with a friendly hostess in a really quiet area.",positive
They took a payment from my credit card 3 times,negative

The location was great. Just a few minutes walk from the station.",positive
"The breakfast was good and with a good choice of foods, but it wasn't anything exiting or of extraordinary quality. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad either, just nothing to write home about!,

The hotel is located in a side street, but actually close to public transport. The room, although not big was spacious enough and did not feel crammed. The room and the hotel are well thought through in terms of usage of space and designed to look simple but cosy and have an agreable ""Nordic"" feel to it. The double bed was large and comfortable. The bathroom had a window (yay!) and was nice and spotless. For Brussels, it was very good value for money. I would definitely go back.",positive
"Nothing.,

Everything - location, friendliness of the people and the accommodation.We may even consider it again for a future holiday.",positive

We stayed here for 3 nights with our 2  children.

Very welcoming host, beautiful property, excellent location.",positive
The host was so helpful and had fresh coffee and delicious chocolate and biscuits on arrival.,positive
"Let's start from beginning - check in goes very smooth, fast and efficient. You are charged full amount of your stay straight away at the beginning of your stay - that seems to be standard procedure from the Hotels that have very high percentage of customers being dissatisfied about quality and the product being offered. After quick check in we arrived at our room - I will remind everyone here - it's a 3 Star Hotel! Standard room - small, that barely 2 people can fit in it, not talking about luggages. In the middle of the room there is bed, standard bed, queen size in our case, and nothing else!!! On both sides of the bed there were 2 wooden shelves - it looked like the shelves taken from my grandpa old garage. No deposit box or safe! No minibar or fridge! No telephone in the room! No tea or coffee making facilities! No room service - if you wanna have a tea you gotta go down to bar and buy it there! It's 21st Century - even homestays offer kettle in their rooms! Bathroom was so small that you can barely move around - of course no shelves or place to put your cosmetics!We decided not to stay any minute longer in that place! 15 minutes after check in we went down to reception to check out (we suppose to stay in this place for 4 nights). On our way out we have been informed by receptionist to contact Hotel Management about refund for remaining 3 nights - either via phone or email. Unfortunately despite many attempts to contact property both via email and phone nobody ever replies or picks up the phone! We spent the rest of our weekend in Brussels in the proper HOTEL.,

Near Centre location was the only positive aspect of our very short stay in this so called 3* Hotel.",negative
"Price of the room was great, very clean and the staff were very friendly and polite.
Accommodating to the dog too so pet friendly.
Breakfast was great, not a wide selection but still good for first thing in the morning.",positive
"Windows on the inside had not been cleaned properly - imprints of hands and other body parts were clearly noticeable :)Bathroom was not 100% functional, shower door did not close completely and inside of the door to the bathroom had stains on it, let's say it was body lotion :),

Very soundproof hotel, near the airport and the ring road, yet you could not hear anything from outside nor from the visitors in the adjacent rooms.Complementary coffee and tea as well as mini-bar with soft drinks is always appreciated.",positive
"Perhaps the reception staff were a bit on the dry side.,

A hotel in a brewery. Need I say more? It is excellent. Definitely get the chocolates in the brewery shop. The restaurant and cleaning staff were great. Really jolly. A special thank you to the cleaner who helped us with unlocking the window in the room.",positive
"Room needs major uplift
Not value for money at 145 euro a night ,

Staff friendly",negative
Super friendly personnel with a lot of helpful tips and recommendations!,positive
"nothing really that i didnt like,

The decore of the hotel is very nice. We had a great corner bedroom that was very comfortable, and with a big bathroom. All felt very clean and the breakfast was really very satisfying. The price of this hotel was so competitive vs other hotels at the same time in the city",positive
"Front rooms lack privacy from the road.,

Great location.",positive
"We had an uncomfortable stay as the property as the apartment wasn’t equipped even with basic fans for the summer. Being a street facing ground floor apartment, barely 10% of the overall window area can be opened for security reasons. Lack of breeze, a hot room without rooms resulted in us barely able to sleep at night.,

Sabine’s behaviour and friendliness, the location, cleanliness.",positive
"Nothing,

it is absolutely recommended to everyone. Singles, families, or any type of group travelling together.",positive
"I'm not sure it's very convenient in terms of location for those who come to explore Brussels without a car. But with a car that's absolutely fine.,

The house is absolutely stunning. The room is very tastefully decorated and the bathroom is very spacious. The breakfast was really good. And the swimming pool is a true gem!",positive
"The sofa etc was not quite clean and the kitchen was only equiped with the minimum such as 4 plates, 4 glasses like the rest of the house really: 1 towel per person and only one bedside light per room. it wasnt a problem but just gave a feeling of only providing the basics.,

The place was not as pretty and amazing looking as the pictures suggest. but overall for the price it was good value for money - the location was great and the check in was super easy. despite the location it felt very safe.",negative
Living room 😍,positive
"Cleanliness of the house!!!!
Big rooms en the open kitchen!!!!
And a friendly host!!! Sure to go back!!!",positive
Nothing it was super,negative
"The place was clean but, under the upper bed, a gum was there at the corner, totally disgusting and it was never cleaned
After breakfast, they clean the tables, after a while, cleaning ladies will clean the bedroom. So, there is no place to stay if you wanna stay in the hotel a little longer before going out
The staff was confusing, one of guys, which was not able to speak English very well, told us that was possible to stay late after checkout in the last day, however, we were surprised because the other guy in the morning told it was not possible
The place is good if you have a car. If you are relying on public transportation, don't stay there. Bus passes once per hour and sometimes not on time (earlier), you will end up awaiting for it more than one hour sometimes or walking more than 1,5 km to get another transport. Taxis also are rare in this part of Antwerp,

The room was confortable, the bathroom was also fine.
The breakfast is very good, many bread options, some fruits, drinks and tasty donuts.
Checkin and checkout very quick and easy.",negative
"Twin bed and ""split sheets"" . Very uncomfortable. Not the quality of the stuff but the concept!,

Very quiet despite very closed from the airportNice decoration",positive
"The room was not ready for us when we arrived even though we were advised we could check in at 2 pm. Not a huge deal but it would have been nice to rest in our room when we arrived. Classy thing to do would have been to give us a free drink or something to make up for it. Breakfast was a little cold by the time we got to it.,

The hotel is really modern and new, and it was so fun to stay next to the brewery. We only stayed 1 night so I can't comment on location since it was just the brewery that we visited. I recommend going on the brewery tour, especially with Bob who was a great guide.",positive
"Wifi was a bit rubbish and often wouldn't work.,

Good solid room, bed, shower etc all good.",positive
"The room was so tiny but I know it so I can complain. ,

The staff was so nice and friendly. The room was cleaned everyday. The towels were changed too. WiFi work good.",positive

Great location, gorgeous communal/lobby area - nice showers",positive
"Nil,

Nice quiet location 5mins walk from the""action"".
The room was clean, the bed was comfy, the shower excellent.
I'm just sorry I had to leave very early in the morning so couldn't tell them personally. First class.

The property was very clean, the beds are extremely comfortable and the house very well equipped. It was also very well located, just as we needed. I would return :)",positive

The beer vending machine!",positive
"Horrible smell. Room and the whole property had the 90's vibe, but not in a charming way. The area did not feel safe.,

Location. Very close to most attractions, but next time I'd rather stay a bit farther as this was not a pleasant property.",negative
"My preference would have been to stay in the main property given how attractive the photos showed the rooms to be, but I suppose that wasn't on.  The substituted accommodations were acceptable though, despite being in need of a bit of ""polishing"".,

As the main property seemed to be full, we were moved around the corner and down the street just a short way and put up in an apartment.  This was fine - a large accommodation with privacy.",positive
"the shower over the bath, when u hang the shower head, water squirts everywhere, literally i had to use 2 towels to wipe the water all over the bathroom floors, later on i had to sit on the edge of the bath and slowly shower, floors still wet but not as bad as when u hang it up . the bath glass door needs to widen to prevent water coming out,

Great value and great location, situated outside the city but walking distance (1 min ) to Louisa Avenue , a famous shopping district. but it will take you 20 mins to walk to Grand Place. the bedroom is nice and the bed is comfy !",positive
"Breakfast is amazing, nice food, good facilities overall. Staff is very friendly.",positive
Hotel was in a very quiet location. My room had no en-suite but had a private bathroom nearby. Breakfast was very good with excellent choice. The staff couldn't have done more to be helpful at breakfast.,positive

It was good",negative

Everything !
A stunning B&B, the staff, location , comfort and a champagne breakfast !",positive
"There were computers not working when we arrived to check in and instead of explaining the situation to us, and the que of people behind us, the guy behind the counter threw a strop and when I approached the counter to ask something I was just told to wait. Our room was also smaller than I expected and the mattress was two single mattresses that were covered separately, so they kept dividing while we were sleeping which was annoying! Overall though it was a nice stay, I think we were just unlucky with how reception was being run the day we arrived and our room was quite comfortable despite the mattresses!",negative

staff really good. He help me order meal.",positive

Clean and spacious room;  great location, right in the city center; very kind receptionist",positive
"Location, friendly staff, comfortable",positive
"We were on the first floor & could easily hear cars & people walking up & down the street.
We could also hear the people in the room above us when they were awake.
Our room had a shower over the bath & you have to be careful turning the shower on as it is quite high pressure so turn it on ever so gently otherwise the entire bathroom will get saturated like it did with us, as the shower head sits up quite high & if the water pressure is too high. It squirts everywhere.
Would have also been good to have small shampoo & conditioner bottles & a shower cap. Only Shower gel in the bath/shower & hand wash at the basin.,

Good location as a short walk to the shopping district & easily walkable to the Metro & most sights.
Friendly staff, good breakfast with variety & lovely Scandinavian furnishings from various designers, Marimekko to name one.
Beds are comfortable & overall appearance of the room is very pleasant.",positive

"Excellent breakfast and very friendly staff.Very comfortable and spacious room.",positive
"The public rooms were not clean and there was a very bad smell (We needed to hold our breaths during the elevator ride). I was surprised about the differences in atmosphere between the rooms and the public spaces. The public spaces can use an upgrade, it is your first impression and that can be improved.,

The rooms are nicely decorated and very family friendly. You can sit together with a big group and because of the open space, everyone is connected. So it doesn’t matter wether you're in the kitchen or living room.",negative
"The decor was perfectly cosy but also contemporary and clean. Kathleen was amazing, so friendly and helpful! The facilities were gorgeous and the perfect place the relax, particularly the lounge area. We'd definitley return!",positive

It is a comfy place, with not many amenities. Simple, elegant, functional. Very good location",negative
"Even though I checked in shortly after midnight, the guy at the desk was very friendly and professional. The room was clean and nice, breakfast was ok.",positive

Parking and shuttle service was great. Proximity to the airport and services cannot be beat. Love the Van der Valk chain. The free drinks in the minibar are always nice as well.",positive
The staff at the restaurant was very nice. We had good service and great food. Breakfast was very good with lots of variety.,positive
"The doors are thin, so you can hear what's going on in the hallway and vice versa.,

Rooms are large, right in the middle of everything, big bathroom. Really good all around. This place used to be a dump, but you can tell they've invested time and money into it finally.",positive

Natalie was a great host!",positive

A lovely building and friendly and helpful staff",positive
"To get into the building you have to enter a code, which not always working, even if it's correct. It's always smells bad on the first floor and in elevator. The appartment itself are nice, but there are a couple of problems. Firstly, the heating system is really strange, so mostly it was cold inside. Secondly, there is no modem in that appartment (I'm talking about penthouse), probably another appartment on the 6th floor has it. It means that you can catch a signal in the kitchen only. And it's really slow, 6MB/s. Finally, no one tell us that there is a huge construction 5 meters from this building. So it was extremely loud from 6:40am till evening. It will be there for next 4-5 month I guess. ,

Beautiful appartment. High ceiling. Huge bed.",positive
"Nothing!,

B&B Bornedrager is a gem! Low-key sophistication greets you upon entry. The restoration of the townhouse & the refined decor is lovely. The hostess, Kathleen, wants to make sure that you have a wonderful stay, not only in the B&B, but also in Bruges. She is very helpful regarding sites & Tours. Breakfast is wonderful: eggs cooked to order, cereals, juices, fresh yogurt, fresh fruit cup, sparkling wine, if you would like it. Cheeses, meats, a variety of breakfast breads Etc. Our room was large & lovely with tea/coffee maker, fridge, safe. Comfy bed & upholstered chairs for reading. Bathroom is large and has modern furnishings. The location is terrific: you can walk everywhere. This B&B is a gem! We stayed for four days and loved every moment. Thank you, Kathleen☺️",positive

The cleaningless was good enough and staff very helpful",positive
"No tea and coffee facility in the room,

Good breakfast with plenty of variety.  Accessible room on ground floor was good.",positive
"We received a phone call to tell us how to access hotel and which room we would be in as reception was unmanned on arrival. We didn’t see anyone until the following morning at breakfast.,

Choice at breakfast was very good and the only member of staff we saw was extremely polite and efficient.",positive
I have been back one day and I have already told everyone about this space. It was fabulous! The owners were very welcoming and the place was immaculate and very comfortable. A really elegant oasis in Brussels.,positive
"Next to construction site, we were not informed of this and could not sleep at all.  There’s no AC so we needed to have the windows open, which would led the construction noises -located next to the building- into the room.  Again, if we would’ve know about construction this would’ve changed but we were not told! The facility sits under a fast food restaurant they use the same elevator as the patrons, it reeks of grease and beef, same goes for the facility.  Also please provide real pillows!,

Location.",negative
"Nothing,

Close proximity to all attractions, well kept apartment in an old house which was an art gallery. Coffee and tea making facilities were included and a beautiful breakfast was included daily.

size of the bed and view on the tarmac. excellent price. very good breakfast. no noice from outside.",positive
"The hotel looks old and is super small (not only the rooms, also the corridors and the lift). 
The walls are very thin and you could hear everything, it was almost impossible to sleep during the night.
Everything is very noisy, you can hear every single person opening or closing the door, and locking the door. 
The floor is made of wood and you could hear people walking.
I got a room on the first floor on the front side, next to the road. I felt like into the road and I could hear people screaming, the bus braking for the bus stop, and cars accelerating. During the night I got woken up several times. I asked to the reception to get another room but I was told that there weren’t others available and that I’m too sensitive and it’s not their problem. He added that if I don’t want to hear noises I don’t have to book a room in the centre of the city (unbelievable!).
Wi-Fi connection was very poor (unusable) and I had to use my mobile data.
Last but not least, the first night I could get some sleep only after 3am as the neighbour from another building kept the music volume super loud. I went to the receptionist and asked him to call the police; initially I was told that I had to call the police(I don’t speak french), not him. After a while he understood that he was the one supposed to call the police and called them.
The worst hotel experience I’ve ever had. I’m sorry to say that but I do not recommend this hotel.,

Only the location, in the centre of Brussels, the hotel is horrible",negative
"Clearly dated but functional. Had to change rooms as the shower was broken, along with the air conditioning and hair dryer. Shower pressure in new room was awful but at least it worked.
Avoid on weekends as it seems popular with stag weekends and the walls are paper thin. Garner what information you need from that statement.
Probably wouldn’t stay here again but if everywhere else in this budget is sold out then it will do in a pinch.,

Ideal location for the train station, only a max 5 minute walk. Staff were pleasant and professional.",negative
The Hygge Hotel is a nice and quiet hotel outside the city center but still very accessible to the city with busses and metro within 5 minutes walking.  The decor of the hotel was very nice Scandinavian design.  And breakfast was also very nice.,positive

The space and the view. The kitchen wasvgood",negative
"Everything was perfect, beyond expectations. Very close to the centre too!",positive
"It is a scandalous to rate this hotel as high the way it appears in the booking site after so many customer complains. 
As for our 3 night stay - NO hot water for a night and a morning after before a most important meeting  in the three days of our stay. The staff didn't do anything (except some artificial smiles which actually were expression of arogance and rudeness)
We have been waiting for an answer (as was promised) from the manager on the compensation that we deserve to get ....until now not even an apology!
As consistent customer of booking - I am disappointed with you guys . I can't rely on your "" trustful"" rating ... (You hide the negative responses and you don't highlight enough the negative responses - apparently you don't  play any role in pushing  such institution as this  to improve. 
I will have to consider to switch to another supplier!,

The location",negative
"I stayed for 3 nights and on the 2nd day nobody went to clean the room. Because I just arrived at the hotel about midnight and tired I did not say anything at the reception. The hotel needs to invest in pillows, the ones I had were really bad.,

Good and quiet location, friendly staff at the reception. Small room, in my opinion proper for 1 person.",negative
"The location is awesome if you're just there for a layover, but to go to the center, you need about 10min to go to the nearest (Diegem) train station. But I wouldn't say that this is a major point.,

Superbox single rooms! They're equipped with PS4s and a VR headset in every room, with cool preinstalled games.There are also BT speakers in every room.On every Superbox rooms floor there is a free-of-charge minibar!The breakfast is excellent, variety of things to choose from.Free airport shuttle with the nicest driver.",positive
"My room unfortunately didn't have a view. Buildings, the street - any view would have been nice. Mine was sadly like looking down an elevator shaft! I don't mind usually, but having a view like this really made my room dark...and I kept sleeping in late every morning because no sun was shining in through the window!,

The room was clean, warm and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful as always (this is the 2nd time I've stayed in this hotel). I've never had any problems, and staff are literally sat at the Reception Desk 24/7, for whenever you have a question :)",positive
"No issues ,

Good location and quiet",positive

I very much liked the Nordic style of the hotel and its coziness. The staff was friendly. The location is good, not so far from the city centre by public transport and very near Avenue de Louise, main shopping street.",positive

The 1 hours of privacy at the ""private pool""",negative
"The common areas of the building are filthy. They bring all the trash bags in the elevators and leave the liquids that sip out and food left overs all over the floor and walls (I have pictures to prove it), the smell is like body decomposition... I have never felt this nauseated over a smell in my life. We just had to use the stairs all the way to the 5th floor.the cleaning ladies use our apartment (501) as a storage (they never cleaned it, which we knew) so you have zero privacy in the common areas.,

Huge apartment, very near the central station.",positive
"Nothing, it was amazing!,

Attention to detail, made feel at home",positive
"No hot water in the bathroom - a quick apology is what I got. The shower head in room 745 had a leak and dropped all day/night long. Pillows were tall and hard - not conducive of a restful sleep. Breakfast buffet is the only option for almost 12€ even if you just want a cup of coffee. Breakfast people overflows to the lobby area making it very busy and noisy. Staff seemed overwhelmed both during check in and check out times. A very disappointing stay.,

Hotel sits on a main road so it’s well connected. Room and bathroom were well cleaned.",negative

"Room was so cold. There was no proper heating. heaters work only 8 pm to 1 am and it was below 0 outside ı froze in my room. Yesterday night ı comeback to hotel a 1:45 am and entrance door to hotel was locked and receptionist didnt even try open the door for while and did some angry gestures like ı disturbed him and drag him out in his comfort zone. (he was watching tv) he was like ""why are you here on this hour""",negative
"You can hear everything that is happening in other rooms, when they are watching TV or talkingand other clients were really noisy starting from 6 am (Not the hotel's fault obviously)The room is not 100% clean, but it's still okay,

The hotel is really close to the central station and the MeirAlso, the staff is really nice",positive

"Charming little hotel with a charming staff in an excellent location for exploring Durbuy and the Ardennes, with excellent breakfast buffet included.",positive
"For almost £200 for one night it was odd to be told that they would try to be there when we wanted to check in. And the sole use bathroom was not en suite but across a public landing. We did not realise it was literally a bed and breakfast room in someone’s private homebut thought it would be a small hotel.,

Big clean bedroom",negative
"BAD SMELL AT THE FRONT OF HOTEL,

RIGHT IN THE CENTER",positive
"We had to report the shower as it didn't drain and quickly filled. The power of shower was excellent and I'm sure this was a very quick fix which should not affect anyone else. No safe in room, advertised there was, although as explained in our review, this really didn't matter.,

This is a very classy, small B&B, the décor is very stylish and quality outstanding, wonderful aroma too, all giving it a feel of a top rated hotel. I am a very light sleeper and concerned to be facing the road. The double glazing, internal binds and black out curtains, blocked any noise or light, enabling an excellent night's sleep. Kathleen is a wonderful host who will welcome you with a smile, she enabled us to check in early. She serves an outstanding breakfast, with varied choice. We had room two, which is a smaller room but adequate, clean and stylish. The aircon is in perfect working order and was left on in the room each day by the cleaners, which meant when we returned, the room was always cool and comfortable. The towels are changed each day and you return to an immaculate made up room everyday. If I had to pick up on anything, I would mention that there is no safe in room two, although the details on booking said there is. That said, you feel very happy to leave your belongings in your room, knowing they will be safe. We are already recommending this outstanding B&B to friends and family!",positive
"It was very commercial and jam packed full of people. Impossible to find a seat for breakfast and breakfast food was very basic. Mattress was very lumpy and difficult to sleep on.,

The design was nice and the location was great",positive
"Price is on the level of 3 stars hotel, but unfortunately, this is one stars hotel. Booked it because needed someplace to sleep the same day I booked.it's clean and ok to sleep one night, but I felt discomfort everywhere :(Toilet, shower, 2-level bad under my bad... I don't like it, felt like I'm in hospital.",negative
"It was not possible to watch TV channels as één, Canvas and many others. This was really dissapointing.,

Breakfast was great with a lot of choices. We take a meal in the evening and also this was delicious. Free shuttle bus was easy to take and on time.  I would recommend this hotel to travellers who have a overnight stay because of their flight.",positive
The bathroom was not clean and the furniture was in a very bad condition. The sink was way to small. The Key to the WLAN was not issued during checkin and not provided in the room. The windows had almost no insulation against the cold from outside or the traffic sound in front of the hotel.,negative

"Be warned, if you're walking from the train stations, it is more than 20 minute walk up a very big hill! We were not prepared for this!!,

The interior design is lovely, helpful staff, and great late checkout time. Nice communal areas to chill out too. Lovely cafe Tich is nearby, or Exki - both do gluten free and vegan options",positive
"Location and smell.The property is right next door to Antwerp Tower which has a lot of work being done on it and they start work around 6am in the morning (not bank holidays and Sundays but they are working early on Saturday morning). On arrival, the apartment didn't have a particularly nice smell. This got worse over the stay and it was coming from the drain in the shower. There is no door between the bathroom and the bedroom so it was not that pleasant to sleep in. We bought some gel to put down the drain and aired the room but could not get rid of the smell. We reported it after our first night but it was not sorted despite being told it was being investigated.We also lost power and after calling the property company, we were requested to go down to the basement to reset it (the fuse box was fine). The property is shared with a restaurant downstairs and luckily we met an employee as we called the lift and they very kindly sorted the power issue for us.,

Location. This property could be rated a lot higher. It has a wonderful central location right on the edge of Antwerp Old Town. We were staying in the top floor penthouse and it has fantastic views out over Antwerp skyline.However, at the moment, it's location is also it's downfall.",negative
"Shower is a bit small, and it would be convenient to have something to place the shampoo and shower gel on. Hose of hand shower needs replacing. Other than this everything was fine.,

Reception: very friendly, and good explanation of the facilities of the B&B and places to see in Bruges.Breakfast: excellent, good variety of products and excellent and friendly service.Location: cannot be better, and even parking turned out to be not a problem (maybe we were lucky...)Very spacious room and all amenities present.",positive

Excellent facilities! It seems brand new forever. Top clean and very well located.",positive
"The window insulation has its limitations. The bedroom at the streetside was quite noisy (we were at the fourth floor). The bedroom at the ‘interior’ was very quiet.
Some parts of the accomodation are a bit run down. Our room e.g. had no functioning curtains, and some appliances miss a button or two (but still worked).
Overall, I can recommend this place.,

Great location and very spacious apartment. Checkin via the codes was smooth.",positive

"The reason people book hotels for their time away from home is to have a roof over their heads and an opportunity to wash themselves. Motel One somehow almost failed both these basic tourist needs for us. Yes, “almost” is the key word here, but the mood and first impression were ruined.
I’ll tell you my story. The day before our booking date I receive an email from booking.com saying my credit card is invalid (my bad, forgot to update it before the trip). It says that unless I updated it within 24 hours, my booking will be cancelled. No big deal, I update it within an hour after the email. In the app my status is changed to “booking confirmed” again. Guess what happened at the front desk? That’s right: they cancelled my damn booking. Absolutely not willing to help and looking at my CONFIRMED booking in the app he doesn’t even apologize. The only room available on the spot is business suite. It seems I don’t have another choice - I pay for business suite: this was about “almost no roof over my head”. What if I was a traveler on budget? What if I simply didn’t have enough money? Not their problem.
Cherry on top to the check-in: it was towards midnight and THERE WAS A LINE for check-in. We waited for 25 minutes only to learn that we’ve been cancelled.
Another cherry: they blamed Booking.com for not sending an email about cancellation (remember this, it’s important for later).
What’s up with lines at midnight? I’ll tell you. The hotel is HUGE. It’s enormous. And only TWO people and the front desk. In our case they called a third one, but it was still 25+ minutes. For this very reason don’t expect special treatment (not even a smile!) because you are not special when there are hundreds of guests.
The shower thing. One morning it turns they don’t have hot water. Just no hot water. For me this was strike two. No phones in the room so we go downstairs to ask. As expected, there are a lot of people waiting (in the line, of course) to be explained. Pipes, they say.",negative
Parking included,positive
"Normally, I get rooms that are impeccable at this property. This time, I was in a room that was not clean, toilets were dirty and in general unkempt. unfortunately, I checked-in late and in no mood to change rooms, but I had not expected this lapse, especially because van der Valk in last 3 years have changed their market perception totally.,

breakfast and in general the restaurants/bar at this place is very good. staff is friendly and price/quality of food is excellent. ideal place for business meetings in a relaxed setting.",positive

The apartment was large and spacious",negative

Kathleen the host was fantastic, we arrived early and she checked us in at 11.00 am, the room was ready, she then provided a map and informed us about all the sights and gave us directions.

It would cost nothing.It's a very lovely kitchen for cooks.Lids for pans would be good too...If you'd prefer us not to cook why put in such a great kitchen?Why not allow people to use the washing machine by providing a tablet or two.Tell people that the shop on the ground floor is big and red and called 5 Guys and the door to smartflats is right there!We're in a new city and need big signs.,

The flat is great. original and fun. It's big, clean and in position A.We loved Antwrep and despite the fire alarm going off in the building on our first morning ,which kind of ruined the day for my already tired elderly partner we shopped and cooked and walked. Loved the baroque and the modern.",positive

"This was a last minute booking on a Sunday by travellers on the fly. What the blurb failed to mention until after we’d booked, was that the managers would give access codes to the key lock, building and lift by email, after receipt of passport copy, 2 days before arrival. We booked on the day and had no roaming internet. Lots of phone calls, photographing and sending of passport.....took us 2 hours to get into the flat. And you don’t expect a penthouse to have stains all over the furniture, a muddy foyer to the building. The ear plugs were a thoughtful touch, but the construction work in the building over the way and on the road below was late finishing and early starting, with builders looking into those lovely windows. Also the toilet is not in the en suite, but by the front door. And the weird shower curtain far from elegant.,

It was very big, with great views through huge picture windows. Washing machine was great. Close to everything in town.",negative

"Well, once arrived we are surprised by an elevator which is out of service ==> 4 floors to climb, two set of stairs to reach one floor ; not that funny with our bagages, stroller and baby in our arms. (and have to do it each time you go in and out !)The common areas are not clean: sticky floors, rubbishs on the hallways and odors.The apartment is clean but needs some finishing : bathroom's spotlights hang from the ceiling, cable torn from the socket, missing baseboard ..,

The open area in the apartment and his perfect localization. Close to the central station, restaurants and city center !",negative
"My review starts with our arrival. All the necessary info regarding our stay was communicated in time and clearly. At arrival at the accommodation the code that was communicated with us was incorrect. Apparently this was not just with us, but with all other people staying. Therefore we were left standing in the rain with our stuff for ten minutes waiting for a whatsapp message with the correct code to enter the building. When entering the apartment we were just simply shocked.- The floors were dirty and sticky;- The tables and kitchen counter were sticky and smelly;- The couch was full of dust and feathers sticking out all over which makes sitting on the couch painful;- The lights in the bathroom were hanging on wires out of the sealing and only one of them was working, therefor there was barely any light in the shower;- The sinks in the bathroom would not drain the water out. Therefore we were stuck with a dirty combination of water and toothpaste in the sinks for the whole weekend;- The amount of water coming out of the shower was just enough to get your toes wet. Showering or taking a bath was extremely unpleasant;- The bath was sticky and smelly. Clearly not cleaned;- There was a bad sewer smell throughout the whole apartment, but especially in the bathroom;- The elevator in the building could not take the heavy rainfall. Therefore we could not make use of the elevator, making us climb the stairs for four floors. Can happen, but no one gave us a call or came by to apologize for this;- The bed in the bedroom was smelly and left me with bites of bedbugs. A terrible stay at Smartflats Antwerp Central for us in apartment 4001.After sending this review to Smartflats directly all we got was an automated an unpersonalised email giving us a 15% discount for a next stay.,

The people from the reception were really nice.",positive
"My biggest gripe was the WiFi. It doesn’t work in the rooms as advertised. When i spoke to staff they appeared to be looking in to it but really did nothing about it, instead advising us to use reception’s WiFi. There was no modem on 3rd floor and the one of 4th floor had no power so I feel that it has been the case for a while. 
One of the staff made me feel that my complaint was not warranted as WiFi was ‘free therefore I should be grateful’ and it was not my right to complain given they have an alternative. 
The bathroom screen was also broken so water ran all over bathroom floor and flooded the main room, under the bed and so on. Make sure you place towels on the floor to prevent this. 
Rooms don’t have air con so if you are staying in the peak of summer, ask for corner room or you may be sleeping with your door open which we saw a few people do. 
Overall I wouldn’t stay there again. ,

Hotel is in a fantastic location. The metro is at the front and you are 5 min walk from centre, with cafes and restaurants literally at your doorstep. Room was clean, had a great view and the one we had was quite large.",negative

Door broken on shower replaced with inadequate shower curtain and the shower head was broken. Walls are very thin and we could hear the next door party and downstairs guests. Stair case was incredibly narrow and a big suitcase would not have fitted. There were also very dodgy electric sockets. DO NOT RECOMMEND.,

Although working all night on Heat mode at 30 degrees, the room remained cold. They definitely need to change the air conditioning brand or type. At home for just 10 minutes I get sauna hot with 15 years old Panasonic inverter.
The water in the shower  was warm (not enough for me) , but not hot. I would've appreciated if there was a hot water so I can define how warm to be and to be able to take a hot shower when outside is 3 degrees and we spent all day long out. ,

The location is  just perfect. 5 minutes Antwerp Central Station and 15 minutes from the center (Grand place).
Late check-in, which is very handy. 
Very polite, kind and friendly staff. 
Very comfortable bed with nice pillows and good goose filling duvets which we loved. 
It was quiet and with almost no noise. I asked for  a room looking to the inner yard with no street view (when booking) so my request was fulfilled. It is perfect for a short period. Also very affordable prices. As overall is great according location, price and comfort.",positive

This is a wonderful place to spend a few days in nature - not only are there hikes on cerf’titude’s doorstep, this beautiful property is also just 20-30mins away from some of the most scenic parts of the Ardennes (where you can hike, trail, paddle in the natural reserve). Isabelle and Benoît are wonderful attentive hosts who offer every morning a delicious - homemade and organic - breakfast. We tried their evening platter and we would recommend it to anyone - their dishes were very tasty and fresh. This b&b also has the advantage of having few rooms so it is quiet and perfect for a quiet relaxing  getaway.",positive

"The staff was really bad, they told us the first day that we can had the breakfast (but didn't mean to pay for it or how much), and the last day they ask to pay for it (also, too much 10€ per person each day). It was very incorrect! They ruin our trip! Absolutely not to come back to! ,

"4.	The heating in the so-called new room did not work at all. I informed the receptionist but he said he can not do anything. It was chilling throughout the night. Balcony glass door was fully covered with dew. If this does not justify the need or expectation to have room heater on at night then I don’t know what does!5.	Bathroom exhaust fans don’t work even if they are present (there is no bathroom exhaust fan in room 22). This means, entire bathroom gets filled up with steam in 2-3 min and the mirrors become useless. I am sure there is a very big mould problem in this hotel but they must be just repainting over the mould to cover it off. Very unhealthy and unhygienic.If this hotel management has even an iota of responsibility then I would urge them to personally verify what I have written. Please don’t treat tourists in this way. Offer something decent please. You are leaving behind a bad taste in the mouth of people due to your irresponsible and unprofessional management. Please set things right by firstly compensating me and then rectifying the situation so that nobody else goes through this hell again. Note: The rooms did not look like the ones advertised by any standards.,

We made a blunder of staying in this hotel at the end of Feb, this year. It spoiled our whole holidays and made us feel homeless. It is an utter disgrace in the name of hotel industry. I have a huge list of complaints against them. I will list down only a few though:1.	Staff is extremely unhelpful and non-cooperative (with an exception of Adil).2.	We were allotted room 55 on 5th floor. The toilet had a disgusting and terrible smell that we had never come across before. Even public toilets would smell as roses when compared to this. It was worse than the smell of the dirtiest toilet, morgue and uncleaned gutter combined. I wouldn’t like my worst enemy to spend a minute there.3.	I decided to book another hotel next morning even if it means loss of money. Luckily, Adil, who was helpful (a very big exception) allowed us to choose another room. This new room (room 22) appeared clean in the day and there was no foul smell. But when we returned to the room in the evening, we realised only one light was working in the room. Adil managed to replace one light bulb but apparently the hotel did not keep stock of different types of light bulbs. This ended up the room being poorly lit in the night. I had to work with my laptop and I could not because it was very stressful for the eyes.",negative
"Although the location is close to the motorway (for me the main attraction; a good overnight stop before continuing my journey) there isn't much else nearby - it is quite far from any tourist attractions.,

"Very noisy at night time from outside with trams  cars ect... and there was no kettle in room so had to go down stairs to buy drinks which cost a bit and the breakfast was way to expensive €11.50 per person and not really much of a choice of breakfast.,

"The next part - I hope hotel keepers will read it - is going to be about the hotel itself.all in all our room was nice but everything was SO old! For example our toilet, I supose, was cleaned with some blue thing and it stuck to it and the toilet became partly blue as well, it made us a little bit afraid to use it. Also many things in the hotel were almost broken and badly fixed, so all in the room didn't look cosy. There was no smell of cigarettes or bad taste at all and a bed was very comfortable, I liked it very much... but still, it is a high time for the repairment for this Hotel :),

Actually I don't think that the district is bad somehow - I have'nt seen any danger for myself, no bad people, it's near to a beautiful city centre and there's a supermarket, like, 20 meters away and there is a big botanical garden very close as well :) So, all in all the location is wonderful.",negative

Great for those who need a spot near the airport. There is a free shuttle to/from every 30min, but make sure to book ahead because it is small and fills up fast! Only 5-10 min drive from the airport. Worth noting you can't walk to and from, but the shuttle makes it very easy. Super clean/nice/modern. We had an overnight layover and this was the perfect place to get some rest without spending too much money on a hotel right inside the airport. Didn't have time to enjoy the bar or restaurant but they looked lovely. Would recommend.",positive

"What a surprise! And a good one. I had to find a hotel at the last minute and was really glad to end up here. The staff is really kind and the superbox room is beautiful and comfortable! The decoration gives a cosy atmosphere that makes you want to stay more than one night. Moreover, there’s a lounge in front of the room with a fridge where you can find free bottle of water or cola, really appreciable. The next time I have to stay in Brussels before a flight, I will stay here for sure!",positive
"Just little nuisance - it took some time to find the Flemish channels on TV (they start at 251, if you want to know) and the news kept breaking up. ,

Great location for hikes around Herbeumont, Semois is just amazing there. We very much appreciated the possibility of being served in the room during Corona. The evening menu was great and the breakfast amazing! Sauna and jacuzzi were of course unfortunately closed. We had the top floor room with skylights, with exposed wooden beams and big shower. It was nicely warm with immediate supply of hot water.",positive
"Nothing was bad, besides maybe the fresh bean coffee I prefer stronger. ,

The great view and sitting outside after dinner enjoying the sunset with a glass of wine. Next to that the food was good, we did dinner at the BNB itself for two days. Great vegetarian food (especially if you're a vegetarian or can do without meat) and my wife loved the wine.",positive

The apartment location is excellent.  Love the washing machine and dryer.  It really helps!!",positive
"What ??!?!? Nothing :-),

I didn't know what I've selected from the booking at the beginning and I didn't have very high expectations, because I was traveling for business purposes with my wife. But when I got to the location, which is very close to the subway and it helps a lot, I had an exceptional surprise, because I found a great studio that was clean, neat and a design exactly as I like. All culminated when we met the owner, who not only was like a mother to us and cooked the best breakfast ever, but she is an extraordinary person. I said it was ""notre belgique mere"". Thank you",positive

The man at the reception was really kind, he gave me all the information I needed, really accurately and with no hurry. He was really hospitable. The rooms were clean and with everything we needed, even if furniture was a bit dated (my mother fell in love with the curtains!). The location is good: it is a bit far from the centre, but well connected using public transport.",positive
"With dishwasher it would be perfect.,

Location is really nice, it is in the field. There is a convenient coal based BBQ, that we did gladly use. In the morning kids were excited to see wild rabbits in the yard. Too bad we had only one night there. But we hope to stay there again.",positive

Staff was really helpful.",negative
"The cleanliness and level of maintenance of the room and the bathroom was just passable. I got a room at ground floor with very poor lighting and the window facing directly on the courtyard providing basically no privacy. Little space for clothes and luggage.,

The main value is the position, close to the city centre and the central station. All the remaining services are pretty basic. Large room and bed. I cannot think of anything else positive but the price.",negative

The breakfast was okay, the room was fine and the hotel itself is a nice place. Staff is polite and do their job well.",positive
"The room was filthy. The whole hotel was filthy to be honest apart from the reception area. Paint was peeling off the walls, the toilet in my room had not been cleaned or even flushed which was pretty disgusting, the bedding it's self I didn't even dare take the top cover off. The noise is the worst I've came across it sounds like someone is stamping up and down the hallway through the night. I think I slept fully clothed on top of the bed for about 2 hours and I think exhaustion is what allowed me that much sleep. I know this is a 2 star hotel but there is no way it should be given more than 1.,

The location was probably the only redeeming quality of this particular hotel. It was pretty easy to find and just a short walk to everything that you need.",negative

Quiet room. good beds, Roomy, Nice Staff",positive
"Currently, a lot of construction works are being done in the building next to the bedrooms. They work from 7am until 7pm, which means that at 7 in the morning, they start drilling and welding, making a lot of noise. Not so pleasant waking up to on your holiday. ,

Big and beautiful apartment, all facilities available and close to Antwerp Centraal and the shopping district.",negative
"The location was near the station. However, the walk to the apartment can be a little too quiet for a female solo traveller at night.,

The room was stylish with a designer flair. It was equipped with a kitchenette complete with oven, hot water flask and coffee machine. The owner was amazing and approachable. She really went out her way to make our stay an amazing one.  Breakfast provided was more than enough for my partner and I. There were bread, cheese, cereal and even juice. We could also access Netflix on the TV.  This was one of the best places we have stayed in and we looked forward to going back to our little apartment each night.",positive

The hotel is well located and easy within walking distance to the metro or tram lines.
I really enjoyed the homely feel of the hotel and the ambience of the property.",positive
"I was only provided with a bath towel. When I asked for a hand towel the person at the reception gave me a bath mat. I refused the mat and he then gave me another bath towel as he said that hand towels were not available.Furthermore, I did not find any cloth hangers to hang two pairs of trousers.  When I again asked the receptionist he said that these were not available.,

"There was no separate bathroom so the shower and toilet were both in the bedroom. Not so good if you like a little privacy.,

Upstairs-room with seating area and table. Outside balcony with views across the countryside. Jet shower. Substantial continental breakfast. Bar available with beers and wine etc. Very pleasant stay.",positive

nothing I do not recommend they are the worst",negative
"No comment. There was nothing to dislike. All positive.,

Fantastic stay in a lovely, well appointed appartment. Very close to Brussels midi station (5 minute walk) which was ideal for the Eurostar. We appreciated being personally greeted by Martine (owner) and being welcomed with a platter of fruit, crisps, bottle of wine and breakfast items in the fridge. Highly recommend staying here.",positive
"There was a persistent smell in the room. The window could not be opened and was half broken (anyway, it was over a busy road). The wifi did not work (or there was no instructions and it was completely non standard, so that the result was the same). The breakfast was minimal, with stale bread and ham slices in open air (but coffee and orange juice were OK).,

The hotel is close to the Midi railway station, and 15 minutes by foot from the touristic city center. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and clean.",negative
"Strong smell of smoke as I am sure the No Smoking signs are ignored !,

I checked out early and left my Ferrari watch on side table, arriving at Dover I called the hotel and the very polite gentleman who checked me in the night before was on duty and took my call, he went to check my room and found it, they are holding it till I return next week to collect it, 100 per cent honesty and help from this guy. A credit ti the Ibis Brand.",positive

The actual room looked nice. Not the cleanest but its nice to be in the middle of the city.",negative

"The outside wall seemed completely inadequate to cut out any traffic noise from the road and specially from the railway. There seemed to be trains all night.,

It is very close to Gare Midi and there were pedestrian crossings handy for crossing the busy road. There were restaurants nearby too. The shower was roomy and good. TV reception was good, as was WiFi. We had a balcony which is nice, though the view was of the railway. The beds were comfy and it was pleasant to have a real double bed not two singles pushed together with a gap in the middle. There was a lift which was helpful as we were on the fourth floor. Bedlinen was clean.",negative

Ok as a quick stop over if nothing else available.",negative
"I was assigned a room facing the inner courtyard while I had specifically requested a room with a panoramic view. The mattress was leaning towards the edge. On the ceiling there was an annoying flashing alarm light even at night. There was no fridge. Booking.com did not give the possibility to book rooms on the top floor with balcony, did not show pictures of the sad inner courtyard and should ensure that those who book well in advance be satisfied with the placement of the room!,

Contemporary interior design.Apart from the lady who greeted me at the reception on my arrival (rather awkward), all the other staff members were helpful and kind.",negative
"Mini bar could have been stocked a bit better but a very small complaint.,

Booked a junior suite and was very impressed- jacuzzi, large shower that turns into a steam room with eucalyptus, heated bathroom floor and very comfy bed. Sushi bar was also great, and parking was easy!",positive
"Nothing!! ,

The property has been beautifully renovated with lots of attention to detail. It had lots of natural stone and wood and was very tasteful. We stopped there on our way from England to Munich because of the good reviews. We were definitely not disappointed. It’s slightly off the beaten track for an overnight stay, but well worth the detour. Frederic is exactly as everyone describes him, very welcoming, an excellent chef and tends to every need. I would definitely recommend this place to others, and hope to be there again one day. Merci!!",positive
"We had a very pleasant stay at Maison d'Hotes Cerf'titude. The owners were very friendly and helpful and even with our unexpected early checkout they made us a nice breakfast.

Spacious clean room. Comfortable bed. Quiet village setting in tastefully modernised old building. Fred was an excellent host and breakfast croissants were the best we had on our trip",positive
"Everything was absolutely wonderful. Our cozy room, the sauna, the amazing homemade breakfast, the romantic atmosphere, the lovely Benoit & Isabelle and their cute dog made us feel like we were in a fairy tale.",positive
"Not good value for Money. The hotel is old with little comfort and according to me, I would rank it low w.r.t comfort factor for the price I paid. No common space available and the area is limited including stairways, breakfast room, etc. The bathrooms are old-fashioned. The shower handle was broken and it would take 5 minutes for the hot water to flow from the shower. No shampoo or soap in the bathrooms. The room looks outdated and needs a lot of improvement. The TV was not working at all and I had very Dull lights in the room. Also only dimmed light for the entire bedroom which was ridiculous. No night or reading lights near the cot. The cot was old-fashioned and not comfortable for sleeping.The Wi-Fi connection was slow.No breakfast available during the days I stayed. The cupboards in the room were broken down. The door was difficult to Lock. Overall, Not good for the Price of the room.Needs a lot of improvements and modernization.,

Friendly and helpful Hotel staff.Close to City Central and Grand place. Many restaurants nearby.",negative

"Not really negative, but needs some improvement:
- there is “roof terrace” connection but with some improvement it could be a real terrace experience

Best experience I've had during all trips!",positive
"There was some noise outside. Soundproofing not the best.
Was a little overpriced for the location and facilities.,

We picked this mainly because we needed to get a Eurostar train when we checked out. The location wouldn't suit everyone, right next to railway.
Friendly and helpful staff.
When we stayed there was a market just across the road that sold everything and was very large. I am not sure what days it is there (we were there on a Sunday) but we'll worth a visit. Old town was a fair walk away but that was our preference as we wanted a location near the station.",negative

"No Breakfast in the Morning. Only available few days and breakfast is very limited. The Hotel needs a lot of maintenance and facilities should be upgraded and modernized. The room was a bit worn out and not clean. Beds need to be improved or replaced for comfortable sleeping. The lights in the room need to be brighter and there should be more lights in the room. very difficult for reading or browsing with Dim lights in the room. The bathrooms are old-fashioned. The shower in the bathroom was broken and no hair-dryer available. Even the Door is broken and is difficult to lock it sometimes. The TV was not working at all in my room.The Internet was slow and it needs an upgrade so that you can connect to Wi-FI with just a password valid for all devices.Now to connect to Wi-FI I had to use a separate Username and Password for each device and it is valid only for 2 days.The stairways are very narrow and bad considering the safety aspect in case of fire. I had a lot of difficulty in moving my luggage to the room via the very narrow staircase.Considering all these, I would say it is not worth for the price of 70 Euros per night..,

The Location is close to the Train and metro station. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. The hotel staff is helpful.",negative
Location is right in the street of diamond shops. Close to central station and restaurants etc. Very convenient.,positive

Nothing, then issues we had make the experience very awful",negative

"What fantastic place.  As we say in the UK, this is a terrific barn conversion, ultra modern in a rural location.  Both the evening meal and the breakfast were of a very high standard, with local or home produced preserves on the breakfast table.  The very clean room had everything necessary including a comfortable bed, and was quiet.",positive
"The area is a bit dodgy. Went out to get some supplies from a corner shop. Apparently the place is close to `places` so dodgy characters are about. The corner shop bossman advised me not to walk around.,

Ideal for a single/two night stay. The stuff are friendly and are speaking English fluently. They even offered me some complimentary water from the breakfast fountain.",negative

"I paid( pretty much!) a single room, including TV and the lighting-yes, no matter what strange it would be!!!The room was very dark, no bulbs in the ceiling, the only lighting source was the neon lights above the bed, which did not work! Just he next day, after my insistence, was brought into my room a small light, that shines discreetly just not to think you're in dark!Tv programs did not work in room( but at the hotel lobby they were running!). The staff told me either there are some working on streets around hotel area or is a plumber who deals the problem, but whom I've not seen!,

Location. Very close to downtown.",negative

"Breakfast quality is quite poor and doesn't include many options (also, there's very little for vegans/vegetarians).Smoke alarm went on and off on the 7th floor where I stayed for quite a while, there was no option to quickly report it unless I just went downstairs. There was a domestic conflict in the corridor, a coupe yelling at each other in French. They were arguing outside my room for half an hour, half naked. I should have booked IBIS.",negative

Beautiful room fabulous food and excellent host. We had our evening meal there and all the food was freshly prepared and tasted delicious . The breakfast was also very good,positive
"Room 22. The WC, wash basin and shower are directly in the room. WC and wash basin have no enclosure, and the shower has only a glass door which partially stop the water. The wash basin is very small. The ventilation of other room is directly at the window, so the fresh air is in fact the air exhausted by others. The maintenance is awful.,

Location is very close to my temporary job at Place Rogier.",negative
"Poor maintenance of facilities in the bedroom - much of the furniture/doors are pretty beaten up; poorly clean - lots of dust in the floor, yellow-ish sheets with a few hairs.. avoid if not in a budget/no other option. Struggles as a 3 star hotel.,

Only the location.",negative
"There is a smell of ""not used"" in the bathroom coming from the sewage. Maybe they should try to fix that for guests.,

The hotel is well situated close to the shopping area. The size of the room is more than satisfactory and the design of the hotel is super chic.",positive
"There was a tick on my bed, the hotel seem to have very bad maintenance in the late times,

Location is good, nice bars around",negative
"Only the street lamp was a bit disturbing during the night which is not the hosts' fault, but Martina inteds to look even into this...!,

I stayed for 4 days. It was an overall excellent experience. Martina is one of the most hospitable hosts I'd ever met. The studio has all you need to feel well - from the large comfortable bed to the walk-in shower, bathrobe and slippers, fully equipped kitchen, lots of lights, some breakfast food and snacks ... and even a complimentary bottle of wine! I loved the black and white-styled studio with the many lovingly set out details. Only 5 min walk from Gare du Nord with excellent connections both to anywhere in the city and to the airport.",positive

Very stingy with hot drink supplies!  only 2x tea bags (a black tea and a peppermint), 2 coffee pods and 2 small coffee cremers.
At €165 for one night- we expected much better from Van Der Valk!
Staff: appeared dour. Can't recall any smiling. 
In outside seating area staff were slow to take our drinks order (15mins at least), despite very few customers.  A mistake was made with the drink order, but rectified easily.

"Very nice location, free coffee, everything was great.",positive
"Hot chocolate machine was out of order, but coffee and other hot beverages were tasty. We got stuck in an elevator once, but got out after few minutes safely. Luggage policy was perfect. No problems with storing it before/after we checked in/out at all.,

We chose this hotel because of the unique design, good reviews and promisingly looking breakfasts - all of the mentioned met our expectations perfectly. Breakfasts are incredible here. You can choose from huge variety of morning dishes - croissants, eggs, beans, bacon etc. The staff is doing great job and refilling everything needed. Rooms are interesting. We'd say the designers prefer minimalism and design over functionality - for example, if you shower for a longer time than normally, you are risking your room to be flooded. Another example - although the ""wardrobes"" are nice, it's almost impossible to store more than few pieces of your outfit there. That's why keeping almost all of our belongings in the suitcase through the stay seemed to be the best option. Our toilet stopped working during the last day of our stay, but staff didn't charge any extra fee for that although they could have thought that it's us who was responsible for that. However, we really enjoyed the stay and if we ever happen to come to Brussels again, Hotel Hygge will be one of the options for us, that's for sure.
PS.: We have got some great travel tip for all of you who'd like to taste some local beverages and are not bound to pay tens of euros for that - visit ""Super shop""! This place is located a bit closer to the downtown, Rue Duquesnoy, facing Hotel Wawrick on the other side of the street. The owner of this place is a warm-hearted, wholesome man. On the first day of our stay, we spent like 7 Euros there, and he gave us beers at a value of 4 Euros completely for free. The other day, he gave us another beers and on the very last day, he gave us a large, premium bottle of beer for free again. The prices of products in this store were really friendly to our wallets and you will be surprised how come that in country with Euro as a currency you can get local beverages that cheap. Felt like Czech Republic for a while.

Great central location for sight seeing and near the Antwerp Centraal train station, Metro, shops, supermarkets, restaurants and bus stops. Decent sized room. Comfortable bed. Good TV and stations including BBC. Plenty of storage. Good shower room. Good breakfast (NB I had to pay 10 euros each time).",positive
"They were happy with their room but just one thing that the isolation was too good that it was very hot when the window was open. (Outside was much cooler than the inside, to give you a better idea.) Luckily the hotel offered a fan but my parents told me that it was still a bit hot there. (They are Koreans who are more used to having A/C everywhere.) Plus, when they opened the window, they heard lots of car noise at night although the neighborhood is very nice.,

I booked this hotel for my parents who came to Brussels to visit me and my partner. They were very satisfied with the hotel. They loved the interior decoration of this hotel and also enjoyed the breakfast.",positive

I would also suggest a telephone in the room, just to ctc the hotel staff in urgent cases, and, a refrigerator. ,

I like the welcome from the reception staff and their help to get a taxi. The concierge service was also very professional, and we were even offered an umbrella when going out for a few hours.
My daughter and I liked the room setting overall and the bed was comfortable.
We also liked the lobby and the bar atmosphere.",positive

Close to public transport,negative
No A/c,negative
"The internet didn't work during my whole stay and although I kept asking for assistance at the front desk (no phone in the rooms to solve these issues) the problem persisted. The worst is that I had to explain myself as if it was me who was doing something wrong when the internet did't work in any of my three devices. So I kept repeating the same explanations to different people in the front desk who did nothing to solve the problem. Quite annoying experience, I must say, especially when the internet is the only ""extra"" service that this hotel offers.,

Comfortable bed in a somewhat austere cadre that offers you strictly what you need to get some rest. No extras of any kind (no kettle in the rooms or phone or wardrobe or safe or room service or any other amenity that may make your life easier). Only recommended if you're going to Brussels for work and planning to spend most of the time out of hotel and just go there to sleep.",negative

"This hotel is situated in North Brussels, and I was concerned when I walked from the train station to the hotel and passed row after row of sex shops with girls in the windows selling their 'services'. There were lots of dubious looking groups of men hanging around on the street which made me feel uncomfortable walking to and from the hotel.The room was basic - which is to be expected with a 2 star, but there was a smear of what can only be described as human excrement on the wall, the shower leaked all over the floor as there was a gaping hole in the bottom of the base, we did not have any towels provided on the first night, and the view from our window was an adjacent roof ledge from the building next door which was scattered with empty vodka bottles, nitrous oxide canisters and spoons which I will leave to the imagination the use.Our first night was interrupted by the fact that the room next door decided to throw a room party with loud blaring rap music and shouting/singing which despite trying to ring reception (From our mobile as the room phone didn't work) went on until 5am, with our calls to reception going unactioned. I get that this hotel is cheap in comparison to others, however it is still expensive for the stay we received, and next time I would pay the extra to stay somewhere nicer.",negative
"The bathroom was a little small but it was clean and provided everything we needed.,

Very nice and clean room with wonderful beds. Great and large garden. Excellent breakfast.",positive
"We had a room with a terrible view, super dark and not 100% clean.
The spa staff were not very clear (and one of them not even nice) regarding their services. Spa treatments were OK, but definitely not worth the money.,

The location is great, the staff at reception were nice, the restaurant food and service is very good. Also we had a maintenance problem in our room which was immediately fixed.",negative

"The room was very cosy and nicely decorated.  The breakfast was excellent : healty, local products and rich breakfast.",positive
"Decoration of the rooms is maybe a bit outdated. It was not that easy to take the breakfast trays to the room, perhaps some other solution could have been considered (e.g. a staff member with a cart to do it for us).,

Staff was very nice, although there were a few hiccups when checking-in that were quickly resolved. As we visited during Covid, we were asked to choose what we wanted for breakfast in a big room and then take the trays to the room.  Breakfast had a sufficient selection. It was possible to request scrambled and fried eggs in the moment. The room was set up to have a meal there, which was quite thoughtful given the circumstances.We also tried the massages in the Spa, which were very nice.The surroundings of the hotel were quite pleasent, Marche en Famenne is a pleasant little town but with a lot of offer in terms of restaurants.",positive
"To reach the place you need a car, and the parking in the area is not always easy. The room could have been with a bit more lights.,

The host, the room and the cleanliness. All was perfect and nice. We had no issues at all and the days spent were very nice and relaxing. A big and very good supermarket is very close by foot.",positive

Nice place in the middle of a small town. 1st day the restaurants and bars were allowed to open again outdoors (due to Covid-19 regulations) and the staff did their best to accommodate everyone. 
I enjoyed the room and the spa 👍",positive
"The wifi in the room was awful, but I assume it was just weak and other rooms are better.,

WiFi was weak in the room, dropping regularly, but fast elsewhere in the hotel. Breakfast had a good selection. No sea view from the hotel, but it is only 50 m from the beach. Underground public parking is 30 m from the hotel with large easily accessible parking spaces and cost 24€/day.",negative

"Unfortunately owing to Corona restrictions it makes it less of a star hotel experience and less value for money. I wish there were some complimentary benefits included in the price (e.g. free bike rental or some reduced spa package for residents),

Location, rooms, staff and spa facilities were great. Central location and the option to rent bikes at the hotel makes it easy to get around this small town. The receptionist Celine was very kind and made me feel welcome and spoke to me in english since my french is very patchy :-). The spa is really nice with a wide range of massage and treatments available. Highly recommend the masseuse Marie, who was very professional and friendly.",positive
Very near to beach. Friendly staff,positive
"Acces to parking,

Central location",negative
"No air conditioning in our room, meaning we had to have the window open which led to a lot of street noise and overall we found the hotel very hot. Our room was directly behind reception which was also quite noisy at times. It lacked a degree of comfort for us, very limited comfortable seating, all the furnishings were a combination of metal and wood. Limited lounge area and bar facilities. We arrived about an hour of so early and check in wasn't until 3pm, we were asked to wait as our room wasn't ready, however during this time a number of guests were checked in straight away......!,

Nice modern hotel with a Nordic theme, well presented and clean. Clean, fair sized rooms, good choice of breakfast with on site underground parking for a fee. Centrally located with access to bars and restaurants",positive

Personnel were very polite and helpful.",positive

"The B&B is located in a small and quiet village 10 kilometres away from Spa. We were lucky to be there in a surprisingly-warm - and dry - March weekend. What if it had poured rain?,

We felt welcome in the property: when we arrived after spending a whole day in Spa, we found bottles of water, home-made cookies, Nespresso pods in our room. The room was big enough to accommodate a crib for our 2.5 year old son. Despite a rich breakfast buffet, the landlady was so kind to ask if we wanted something we couldn't find.",positive
Amenities were not replenished.,positive
"It is not a 4 star hotel,

Good price. Decent breakfast. Good location.,positive
"Because there was no exhaust system in the bathroom the room became very damp and warm on a hot spring day as ours.,

Clean, minimaal but warm. Very scandinavian feel to it. The room was simple but had everything it needed.",positive
"We asked for a quiet room and were informed about renovations on the 3rd floor, so we got the 6th floor offered.As it is below the meeting rooms and there were Xmas parties going on, I preferred not to be just under the 7th floor.So, we moved to the 2nd, with reassurance that works on the 3rd would not start before 08.00 (the moment we were leaving anyway). However, the second night there was a party on the terrace, just below our room, so our quiet room was not quiet at all due to the music noise.I was also suprised that at the check-out we were not asked how our stay was - if we were asked, I would have mentioned this there instead of writing it here.Huge queue at check-in at lunchtime with a waiting time of at least ten minutes. 2 counters and a total of 4 guests ... and one sneaking in with a short question.Last but not least - the amount of emails I got after the booking, at least 4 between the reservation and the actual stay ...,

Big bathroomRoom was very clean",positive
"I would prefer to stay in a place that offers breakfast, but if I knew better I would take few things with me to make my own breakfast because the apartment had a small kitchen all equipped. Next time I will get advantage of that.,

It was clean spacious, straight forward!",positive

Very well equipped apartment with everything a business traveller could need. Very clean and comfortable. Convenient location for Brussels Centre and Zaventum",positive
"Nothing.,

I loved the location, it is close to the train station and flixbus station.
Good area.
Facilities were good. Bright room and with large windows, it was a bit hot so opening the windows gave a fresh air sensation, the breeze was so good.
Hot shower and good beds. Felt comfortable.
The staff were all welcoming and patient as I had to wait for at least 4 hours to check in, they allowed me to stay there in the sofa and wait until my room was ready. Also allowed me to check in earlier than expected.",positive

Parking is  not free,negative
"The rooms only had one mirror in the bathroom, no full length, I was traveling with my adult daughter so this made it more difficult to get ready.  The other problem was there was no good place for our suitcases. We ended up using the desk chair and the desk because the shelf was to thin to hold a suitcase. I could only put my suitcase on the desk sideways. I think installing a full length mirror and at least one folding luggage rack would be a very inexpensive improvement. There is no air conditioning that we could control so we had the windows open. But it wasn’t very hot so that was ok. I’m not sure if there is any type of air conditioning, so I’d check that out if you are staying during summer months.,

Very nicely decorated, extremely clean and you could easily walk to places. We did not purchase the breakfast but we did eat in one Italian restaurant around the corner that was good. The internet was in our room was strong. The shower was fantastic and it was one of the few rooms I’ve stayed in in Europe that knows how to put a door and a lip on the floor to prevent water from leaking!",positive

Charming Proprietors, wonderful garden, excellent breakfast. As we stayed only for a stopover on our way to France, we had not enough time to enjoy the nice atmosphere and all the facilities.  We would have wished to stay for some days more.",positive
"The reservation cost was deducted from my credit card 2 days before arrival. Upon check-in, I had to pay the full amount. The amount deducted from my credit card has not yet been refunded. This deduction was made twice for 2 reservations.,

The location, environment & atmosphere was really enjoyable. Value for money! The breakfast buffet was exceptional. Absolutely enjoyed my stay.",positive
"The area around the chalet is beautiful, we had great walks and biking trips surrounded by water (easy to plan with the numbers system of Wandelknooppunten or Fietsknooppunten). Still, I was smartworking from there, so I spent quite some time in the chalet: cute location, view on the water, great WiFi, full facilities for some easy daily cooking, quite place.",positive

Great location. Beautiful rooms. Great food. Great staff",positive
"There’s nothing to dislike . A balcony we normally love but these apartments come without it. Maybe next time we take a corner one with a window up to the floor.,

Best location, we could get a safe garage for our car, very stylish apartment with perfect air condition Friendly and helpful staff, we were there for the second time: perfect",positive
Nice and clean solution for business travelllers very  closed to bluepoint conference centre.,positive
"Very bad hotel, safety and hygiene are the least of their concerns and overall badly maintained- The closet fell down and i almost hit my head- The tap is broken- Dirts are everywhere on the wall, door, wc, etc ...- TV is not working (But it was the least concern ...)- You need to wait 15 minutes for the water to become warm- WC and shower are directly in the room, no real separation- Water leaks from the shower to the room- The neighborhood area around didn't seem safeSee attached photos from inside, so you know what to expectI complained the first night about the closet and the tap but they didn't care much, I stayed 2 nights and i am really glad to leave this place.I absolutely don't recommend this hotel,

Almost nothing",negative

Nice, large rooms. Everybody was very friendly.",positive
"Nothing to dislike!,

From the moment we arrived, Max (the owner) made us feel very welcome! He is a very caring host, with eye for detail, always up for a good chat and willing to provide tips about the region.The chateau itself has a wonderful location overlooking a valley. It's set on a very peaceful property but is conveniently located close to Liege, Maastricht,... Our room was really nice, spacious and clean, very comfortable beds and a really good shower! Breakfast was excellent (and prepared with care by Max)! We've already recommended the chateau to our friends and would definitely book here again!",positive
"There are not many facilities in the little village and understandably no dinner was being served as a result of the COVID measures. We got offered a ride to Sankt Vith to pick up some take-away food instead. We were happy with this solution, but would have appreciated a heads up that we were going to be charged for this service.,

The B&B is located in a separate part of the house with a shared living room and kitchen. The kitchen had basic furnishing and a fridge with various beverages (beers, wines, sodas, etc.). Our bed room was quite spacious and comfortable.",negative
"Only minor details.. Like dessert forks missing.. TV could be upgraded to a more recent model enabling Netflix ... Stone carpet on terrace not so comfy. ,

Lovely pool, very nice staff and food service in these corona times was excellent and very good food too! 5 min walk to the beach.",positive
"Beds were soft and matesses slipped off the bed base. Also I had a lumpy pillow but in fairness this was replaced as soon as I notified the staff. Overall the appearance of the room was a bit shabby but it was at the end of the day a budget hotel.,

Nice staff and although there were things that could have been better it more or less represented value for money",positive
"Nothing bad at all. Only trying would be as we were staying on the top floor the room would get quite hot in the day while we were out which required us to keep the window open whilst we slept. ,

The decor was lovely and the location was perfect for us to walk to the centre and he also around Ixelles.",positive
"the room had a horrible smell of smoking via the heating, making it impossible to sleep. So bad.  I mentioned it to the person who brought room service (cold tomato soup which should have been hot..) and she said she would inform reception.  never happened...  as I had to leave at 5am I just sat there and left it.  AND the shuttle does not operate before 6am.  making me pay 23€ for a taxi for a distance of only a few km.  Not to be repeated I'm afraid...   Viva Sheraton...     ps.  best to change hair dryers too when you renovate rooms.  the current ones you have are not very good. Nor did wifi or tv function properly.    its a shame, as the hotel was recommended by a colleague but I wont return.,

location is good, beds are ok.",negative

The hotel and the room where very clean and beautiful. We really enjoyed the interior decoration. Super comfortable bed, friendly staff. Everything was great!",positive
"I stayed here last year during the same time, and had a way better experience back then. This time, the shower was overflowing (not well sealed) and the blow dryer stopped working after 30seconds. The bathroom had a weird (not fresh) smell. The room was very noisy (could hear every word my neighbors were saying). Although I had the “do not disturb” sign on my door, the cleaning team knocked very loud on my door around 8.30 am. ,

Good location (5min drive from the airport). The rooms have a nice and cozy decoration. The drinks (water, coffee, tea, and coke) are included.",negative

"Arriving to Chateau Charles is like entering a fairy tale, the environment, the driveway to the castle, the lights in the orangery are only a sign of what is coming. The extremely warm welcome in the beautifully renovated historic castle in the middle of a well maintained garden. The owner and staff went out of their way to make us feel instantly at home in this unique setting. The breakfast was excellent, with a lot of fresh and organic products, freshly made jams and a wide selection of bread, coffee, tea and everything one could need. Before leaving, we already started dreaming about our next visit.",positive

Location is excellent.  In the city center and few steps from beach promenade, harbour and main  shopping area. Rooms are comfortable although a bit smaller but spacious enough for shorter stay. It was cleaned every day with daily challenge of towels and few times a week change of bad sheets and covers. Polite and helpful staff. Excellent offer of bread for breakfast and very good coffee.",positive

"I stayed there for less than 8 hours, checked-in at midnight and leave at 8:00AM to the airport. I like the location because you can walk there less than 5min from the train station, its literally in front of the train station on a big avenue, which makes it noisy. But I slept well with earplugs.",positive
"There was a minor inconvenience with WiFi in my brothers room that went out for the day. Since they were not able to get it back in order during the day, they moved my brother to another room which was a nice touch on their part.,

This is a great hotel, right in the city centre, from which we could visit all the major touristic sites on foot. The rooms are cozy, clean and well organised. When checking in there was a rather sizeable line, but the front dest crew was fast and efficient.",positive

"I needed to change the apartment after my second day because the microwave didn't work and there wasn't any casserole in the apartment to cook pasta, for example. I stay in an apartment because I want to cook my own meals and a casserole and a functioning microwave is something that I looking for in an apartment. The good part is the personal in reception who help me without hesitation.,

The apartment was comfy and clean. Modern. The personal in reception really helpful. You don't need to collect keys, the doors works with a code you get by mail. It was really easy. The code changes with every guest, so nobody is going to enter in your apartment. The location is good, near Diamant metro station.",negative

Good location, very close to the airport and airport shuttle service was available. Although it may be helpful to extend the last shuttle to midnight.Breakfast was also good and rooms were decent",negative
"Hate to say it as its really great but I think a few things need maintenace.  The door handle to the bathroom fell off, the toilet lid fell off and the flush panel fell off.  There was no shower screen in room 507 and in 503 I think the bath was put in the wrong way round.  it didn't make sense but it wasnt a major problem,

I liked the simple way that you can get into the rooms, and into to hotel.Also, I liked the fact that even there wasn't mentioned on Booking there was breakfast included. It wasn't a very ""fancy"" breakfast, but it was simple croissant & coffee, and that's all I need in the morning.",positive
"The stairs to reach our room.,

We spent a night with the familly: children and grand parents. All were delighted by the stay.I went to QL 15 years ago and all was as before.  Maybe a bit of rehearsal one day?Personel is really friendlySo very nice stay but as everybody in this world, improvements are possible :-)",positive

"The room could have been cleaner. Not that it was outright dirty, but there were several spots in the bathroom that were missed in the cleaning process. The carpet in our room was old and had several stains. The furnishing seemed somewhat dated. In my opinion, the room could use a refurbishing, then it would be perfect.,

Good location, close to public transport and to the highway. It takes 10-15 minutes to drive to the city center.Excellent parking garage with key code access, cost is 15€ per day.They send you instructions to retrieve the access code to the room, which is quite straightforward - we arrived late at night, which was no problem. Staff was very friendly and helpful every time we interacted with them.Huge bathtub, albeit very low water pressure - took forever to fill up",positive

Breakfast cost extra but was nice and fresh with some vegan options. Very quiet in the room, nice decor, comfy bed, good location.",positive

Also although room is very attractive there aren’t a lot of places to put things, ie no luggage rack or bathroom shelves-guess they felt ‘aesthetics was their primary concern.,

New facility, very smartly appointed, hand of interior designer/architect everywhere. Lovely breakfast buffet. Our room faced interior courtyard so very quiet, terrific beds. All galleries/ shopping within walking distance and Brussels South Station is  three stops away.",positive

Inside was something from the 1980s and dirty and smelly and rank. The room was dated and dirty. We had no toilet roll. When we left in the morning the sidewalk was awash with  maggots from the bins. I would definitely recommend NOT staying here. Find somewhere else please.,

We did not like ANYTHING at this hotel",negative

"To reach the city center, at least 30 minutes walk is needed. A steep hill is needed to climb to reach the accomodation. Not recommended for walking if you have weak knees. Advise to hire a car or taxi to get around.,

The room is clean and insta worthy. Also, the furnitures are made of wood and hence has a super cosy feel. Very nice and cute decorations. The room is very well equipped, has full set of cutleries, cooking utensils, pots etc etc. The bathroom is very modern and super clean. The bed and pillows super soft, very comfy to sleep. Love love love the room very much! The owner is super friendly and nice! Thank you very much! Definitely recommend!! :DBesides, the environment is super relaxing, has farms for horses, cows, sheeps around. Happy! So I dont mind the 30 mins walk to city centre :D",positive

Great location. Rooms very neat. General old feel to it with maintenance needed in main building,positive

The bathroom
The crowd
The storage room for our bike
The dinner",negative
"I spent two nights in the hotel. However, one of the windows facing the busy road outside was broken and did not close all the way. The staff tried to fix it to no avail. A major construction site and busy traffic outside made sleeping from 07:00 onward impossible (despite being used to noise and having ear plugs).Heavy machinery has been on site for months and the construction work will continue for some time.That the management still asks for €120,- per night (breakfast not included and on weekdays) is unacceptable.,

Self-check-in went fine despite late arrival. The staff was friendly and I got to grab some croissants for my travel, location was good for my purposes.Rooms was very spacious, with a big, comfortable bed.",negative
"Elevator a bit old and small...,

Perfect location in the centre of Liege!",positive

Le Petit Gite de Durbuy was perfect for our family weekend in the green! We were warmly welcomed by our host, the rooms were nice, cosy and clean (great beds/ mattresses!) and the breakfast was amazing.",positive
"The breakfast and the dinner are very good. There is a proper dinner table on the room to have your meals and you get serve the dinner at the table with plates and cutlery.  That is a plus cause with the covid rules most of the times you end up eating in your room on the bed in lunch boxes, weigh is terrible.",positive

Room is great! I like the code system to open the door.,positive
"No toiletries provided (shampoo etc.) No a/c but has good high celings and a cooler rear where bedrooms are located so was okay. No kettle or toaster provided. Could have provided more than one dishwasher tab.,

Great location in centre of Liege. You will need to find parking outside the area as it is all pay parking nearby as with all appts in the centre. Lovely older appartment that has been modernised with oodles of character, lovely high ceilings and great city views. It was very clean and uncluttered. Very large appt and was really comfortable for a family of 4. Shops, bars and restaraunts all very close. Would highly recommend",positive
"- We were on the second floor and my husband had a very difficult time with his height.- The WiFi is available but turns off every two minutes or so, so might as well not be available.- The breakfast was €15/person and while beautifully presented, is essentially just a very large basket of bread, a soft boiled egg, and a few slices of cheese/salami. We would have loved even some fresh fruit or yogurt.,

The whole area was very quaint with the courtyards and stonework. Even though the exterior was vintage the inside was updated (thick windows, lovely shower, soft beds). The kids loved looking at the animals in the garden area. The staff were friendly.",positive
"The rooms could use some freshening up decor-wise, but they were very spacious and clean.
The bathroom was minimal, with a tub and shower curtain. I prefer a walk-in shower. ,

We loved the view, the gardens and location. There are also beautiful trails/promenades starting at the hotel site.
Staff is also very friendly, great service. 
Moreover, the restaurant was great! We had an amazing dinner, seasonal and very well prepared. Absolutely loved it.",positive

Easy to get in and out from the airport with a direct bus connection.My third time there and I will go back next time I am in Brussels.",positive

Within 10minutes from the bus stop, and 13 minutes from the City Hall, the property is cozy and provides an excellent dinner menu!

Clean, quiet, free parking because of roadworks, decent breakfast, spacious room,  bed and shower OK",positive
"Parking in a local garage would have been quite expensive for our two night stay, but a ten minute walk was enough for free street parking.  Wearing a mask on the streets was too much, but not a fault of the accommodation!,

The location was excellent. Very spacious lounge and bedrooms. The check-in was prompt and friendly",positive

"-,

Great location with the town centre at walking distance. The flat is on the ground floor of a modern building, so everything was new, clean and in perfect working order. The flat is comfortably furnished and there is everything you need and more. Perfectly clean as well. Beds are very comfortable. The host is very welcoming and friendly. He got in touch right after booking and every contact was quick and easy via WhatsApp. He went out of his way to help us with all our needs. It was a perfect stay and we will come back.",positive

The rooms were very comfortable",positive
"Nice hotel with amazing restaurant, recommend to combine the night stay with dinner in the restaurant",positive
"Apartment worn down, smelled of cigarette smoke. Mechanical noises from within the building (guess the elevator). Could not access the parking garage, unable to reach the host by phone (busy signal, phone number in the lobby was out of service) so had to street park. Extensive construction is going on on Bd. Reyers, so hard to get to the facility.,

Location was excellent since I needed to be at the Diamant Building, which is just across from the street. Spacious apartment, well-equipped kitchen. Having coffee pads provided was excellent.",negative
"Everything was perfect! The host was really kind, and the room was quite, comfortable and full of facilities (pots, pans and crockery, coffee machine, etc..).",positive
"The rooms seemed quite old and the walls were quite thin so you could hear guests in other rooms. For the price, I would expect a slightly higher quality. Also for the price, I would expect the use of the sauna to be included.,

The restaurant in the hotel for dinner was fantastic! The staff were also very friendly. Great proximity to hiking and also just a 20 minute walk to town.",negative
"If you want a really quiet location, the new place was above a cafe in a pedestrian area so you hear people talking until quite late given it is at the touristic centre of Ghent. However, that also has its charms. It is an amazingly beautiful area, and very congenial. Seeing all the bicycles with the kinds at their front is in itself a very calming experience. Great all around if you can bear the,

The owner let me know in advance that he was transferring me to another venue than the one which I had booked. It was more central - thus more expensive but he would not change the price. One of the reasons for which I had chosen the original place was that parking was available. This meant a 15-20 minute walk to the new venue but I did not mind that.The new venue was exceptionally good (especially for the price I had paid) though its central location also meant it was less quiet than I had expected. But still an amazing experience. Even at the normal price (which I do not know) I would have rated the service excellent.The breakfast was stupendous and the staff really, really friendly and helpful.",positive

Good rooms comfy beds the garden is nice feature",positive
"The sound can carry easily between rooms. This was not a problem for us, but may be for others.,

In particular the food was excellent! We enjoyed both dinner and breakfast at Hotel Saint Martin and would highly recommend it. The hotel staff were very friendly and kind. The hotel is well located as a base for exploring the surrounding area (we visited the region between Bastogne and Spa while staying here). We also enjoyed watching the family of deer who live outside the dining room window :)",positive

From start to finish my dealings with this property we’re brilliant. A special thank you to Nathalie’s father who met us to let us in and show us round.

Ambience and location along with cleaniness",positive
The location is so peaceful and pretty!,positive
"The room was not super-clean. We found some leftovers in the fridge from previous guests and there were some butterflies killed on the wall. The small terrace was basically unusable. There is no shower, only a bath tub where showering is an adventure. It was not clear from the beginning that we had to pay a surcharge of 10% (14€) for our dog, and we discovered at the moment of the check out. All in all it was a bit too expensive.,

The location is very nice and the staff is very friendly and competent. The structure is nice, not very old but it feels very much in line with the place. The exterior is definitely a plus, the garden is beautifully maintained. The breakfast has some home made cake and stuff as well as apples and oranges from the garden.",negative
"There are two faja lobi places in the town, only one of them is in the center. Make sure that you have the right address. Also, I recomend that you go to this place if you have a chip and can make phone calls, because the person that receive you sometimes needs to be called so they can open the door for you. It is not so close from the city center but it is a nice walking.,

Our hostess was very friendly! She told us everything about the city and also she treat us very well! The place is also very cozy and they offer you a good breakfast!",positive
Ondanks corona was alles correct geregeld,positive
"Breakfast is at 15euros: a little bit expensive for what is on offer.,

This hotel's design and location are outstanding. It feels like home. Very calm whilst close by the metro Louise, we couldn't have asked for a better location.

I like motel one s when looking for simple but predictable hotel in the city, well located, clean, comfortable bed,.. Everything for a stay without surprises",positive
"I have a bad experience with this hotel. I booked Non-refundable room. All other hotels was charged the total price of the reservation. But this hotel didn't. On the second day of our arrival at noon, we found out that they took money from our card and didn't ask us. It was our last money on the card. I was going to pay cash. Because of that in Amsterdam, we could not book online tickets to several places and had to pay more and wait in the queue. But the worst thing was when we found out that the tickets to the Van Gogh museum can only be buy online. My wife really wanted to enter the museum.There were NO Wi-Fi at all. The carpet was dirty in our room. Far from city center.,

Room was big and very comfortable. The hotel close to public transport.",negative

"The room was WAAAY too hot and dry. Our heater wasn't even turned on so we're not sure where the heat came from... my mum went to bed that evening with super itchy legs, and ended up with a rash on her leg which she still has now (a week later). The morning after we stayed here, I ended up developing dermatitis on my face and still have it now!,

Great location, design is lovely, good breakfast spread. We arrived early and they let us leave our bags behind reception while we went off wondering into town. There are lots of decent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.",positive

"- room with garden view is small, at least a lot smaller than advertised (est. 15m2; a bit too small with a little kid; 22m2 only including the hall and the bathroom)- walls do not stop noise from neighbouring rooms.- breakfast at extra cost (EUR 12.50 p.p.) is relatively modest for the price.- no communal space,

- super comfortable beds. the bed linen is superb, I slept like a baby- room designed with eye for detail, also including the beautiful bathroom- garden with animals- parking lot nearby- relaxing garden chairs in front of the room",positive

Breakfast and the garden! The staff were also great!",positive
"Dat er geen huis 🐈 was,

The rain shower",positive
"no shower gel...only a tiny 10ml bottle, for a family room with 4 beds; we asked the cleaning lady and got more...as we avoided room cleaning for virus concerns.
found dust in room, in a few ""not so used"" areas, not huge problem - we cleaned anyway for virus concern,

slept right next to trains - can be heard when in room; but not when sleeping...either really tired or just very neglijable.
we avoided room cleaning for virus concerns - nice surprise with package waiting on our door of clean towels
parking (covered) really close 25 eur per day.
very good matress (medium firm) and pillows (one soft, one firm-ish)
pool very nice on rooftop, just 1,25 m deep though; poop from seagulls could be cleaned more often.
breakfast very good with lots of options, no vegetables though - overall is too high priced: 20 per adult, 10 per child.",positive
"The furnishing of the (superior) room was basic - no sofa, fridge or a tea kettle. And while the bathroom was stunning, it was completely impractical - the lack of a shower curtain and incorrectly sloping floor meant that it flooded every time we took a shower,

Pleasant, newly furbished hotel at a central location with some Scandinavian design flair. Beautiful common spaces & very decent breakfast",positive
"Nothing not to like ,

Everything about this accommodation was perfect.",positive

Very clean, beautiful, quiet, and welcoming generous hosts. Large sunny garden with goats, hogs, ducks, chickens, rabbits and cats. Good public swimming pool right next door serving decent taverna food at excellent prices. Perfect for relaxing on site; fishing kayaking biking and Durbuy nearby. A very comfy dream bed.",positive
"Very slow restaurant, but the dinner was excellent,

Nice room in separate building from main hotel, but very close and safe parking for motorcycle out of view from the road",positive
"It would have been nice to have a TV in the room especially since everything in Ghent closes so early,

Unique building with friendly staff and a delicious breakfast",positive

I really enjoyed staying there.",positive
"We were not informed in advance that the studio was under the roof ( 2nd floor) - not easy to carry the luggage and the baby,  and to climb for our elderly grandma. It was hot, we had to ask for a ventilator. We were refused breakfast, although the option appeared as available on the booking site. Studio absolutely not baby friendly. Host approach: not client-oriented, although responsive.,

Cleanliness. Access to the garden (although we were hoping for direct access).",negative
"The venue is next to a busy road so you hear traffic up on tue terrace.
Breakfast is quite early from 8 to 10.
No table available for the terrace. We used the little table from inside with the lamp and booklets. ,

Superbe garden can stay here and just enjoy the surroundings.
Walking distance (1km) to town.
Dogs are allowed and welcomed by the staff, unfortunately not by all the guests (one of the guest was pretty rude at breakfast about a dog being present).

Near to city, nice hotelbar, okay breakfast",positive
"The mattress, pillows and especially the CARPET need urgent renovation. The kitchen counter is not dirty but degraded/stained, needs to be replaced basically. The carpet is a mess, very stained and used. A horror show if you concentrate too much on that. You can tell that the hotel needs renovation but it is possible to still feel how great it must have been when it was new. One of the small sofas had lots of dust (which I easily cleaned). The kitchenware was very clean but missing a basic breakfast bowl. Nevertheless, if you forget those small details, the level of quietness in such a busy area of Brussels can make you forget all of that (but NOTE: only if you get a room to the back!!) . It would even be better if the windows were cleaner (the rain carries dirt that normally clouds the glass a bit but the fact is that it had not rained for three days, so that means it is not part of normal cleaning or that during the epidemic the service is downgraded a bit for lack of staff...) but opening them and letting the bird chirps come in was really a balm for the mind.,

The quietness. The sheer zenitude of the wide windows facing the private garden and the comfortable single sofas where I could sit looking out.  The cleanliness of the bathroom. The great friendliness and care of the staff. Good wifi. The furniture, especially two very nice tables (with comfortable chairs), very useful to eat or work on. Good heating and all kitchen appliances clean and in perfectly good working conditions.",negative
"The room was hot (no AC), the shower was blocked on hot water (at least we couldn't change it). It was not at walking distence of Durbuy but they can't be blamed for this because I just looked for a quite place close to... and didn't mention it had to be in Durbuy. It's not easy to find without GPS and this house number can't be found on the street (you should look for number 21...),

It was very calm, the room was clean and the check in system easy (letter with key in mailbox). It was a nice romantic room. There was also a little kitchen with a refrigerator and fully equipped and even an extra bed for a child.",negative
"Had a room on the streetside, as the windows are single ones the noise of the traffic was very loud and kept me awake. ,

Bathroom was obviously renovated and surprised me. Very clean and large bathtub.",negative

Good location and lovely shabby chic room",positive

Comfortable bed. Clean room. Close to the train station if you want to go to Bruges.",positive
"The location is quite far from city center/important attractions of Brussels (e.g. Grand Place)  approx 17/20 min walking, even from the Gare Midi - 3 stops by subway.  For shoppaholics, hotel is near one of the biggest streets of luxury shopping like LV, Tiffanys and others.,

The room was a bit small but was very cozy  - scandinavian design and  very clean. Bed was comfortable. A minus - there is no closet to put the clothes like jackets and shoes..",positive
The Interbellum was the perfect place to stay while touring the Flanders area of Belgium.   Quiet yet an easy walk to all the things to do in Ypres.   We would definitely stay here again when visiting the area.,positive

The staff were very helpful, and parking was provided a few minutes walk away from the property. It was an easy 15 minute walk into the centre of Ghent, and we found an amazing restaurant nearby for our evening meal. The shower was amazing, and breakfast was excellent.",positive

Diverse and yummy breakfast!",positive

Large room and big bathroom. Beautiful decorated room, albeit a bit quirky. Host is conservationist so will plant a tree in Amazon for every guest. Breakfast quite good but slightly limited choice. All very relaxed and we enjoyed our stay. It is 15 -20 minutes walk into centre of town.",positive
"We had a view of the train station which was a shame but the noise was nothing to worry about which was great. Would have been nice to have money off the parking as it’s a multi-storey connected to the hotel which was 22.50euros for overnight. ,

Very clean and modern and very comfortable room for a family of 4 and a great roof top pool. A short walk to the beach around 10minutes without a fast pace.",positive
the garage spaces were very thin. almost not doable with a suv.,positive

Great location, just a few minutes walk from Ypres centre. Very clean comfortable apartment. Well equipped kitchen with tea and coffee provided. A fridge full of good beer and wine was most welcome after a long journey( and the honesty box prices were very reasonable).",positive

The rooms were spacious and exceeded expectations, the hosts accommodating to requests. Relaxed atmosphere.",positive
"- The breakfast was really poor, we paid 15€ pp for coffee, 1 egg, juice and some bread and cheese/ham (and the butter and cheese/ham was really minimal). - A lot of noise from the family living in the neighboring house and from the b&b guests. - The reception was weird as we just picked up a letter and keys and when I sent a message with some questions the answer was that everything is on the paper.,

The rooms were quite nice, beautiful farm style.",negative

"We thought that in the summer it would be a little bit annoying and warm in the room because it is not possible to open the window because of the bees in the garden. It is also a little bit noisy in the houese, since the door of the entrance of the house is stucking and we woke up because our room was in the first floor towards the entrance..,

We really liked the accomodiation. The breakfeast was good and the service too.",positive

The room is spacious, well equipped and with great natural lights.",positive
"Nice, excellent!!!!",positive
"The stairs are small, so with luggage (of two weeks) it's cramped. We had no idea it wasn't allowed to park in the street for more than two hours, but with the excellent help of the owner we parked only a block away.,

What a cozy place, it's like you're in the city garden. Bed is great, view of the garden excellent. Food is even better, as is the welcome, breakfast and check out. If we ever return to Gent, Faja Lobi is our place to stay.",positive
No parking for hotel guests. You need to pay extra and it's too expensive.,positive

Exceptionally clean, the beds were so comfy, staff were helpful, good location",positive
"Works ongoing next to the property make access a bit difficult.,

Nice, clean place, very good service, spacious room.",positive
"A lot of mosquitoes in the bedroom. We had a top room which was good in terms of quietness and was spacious however with the need to have the windows open near to the tree foliage, mosquitoes come in.Internet is not good. We needed to have the room door open to get any signal and this was variable probably due to the number of other guests using it at the same time.,

Maya is a very welcoming hostess and provided a great deal of local information which to make our stay more interesting than it would have been otherwise.Very good breakfast - the best on our trip to Belgium.",positive
"There is only 1 person for all check-in, check-out and logistics questions.,

The rooms are quite nice and it is still a pretty new hotel.  We also enjoyed the open air swimming pool with warm water.",positive

"No on site car parking,

Location sound proof bedrooms and breakfast",positive
"These are very minor things:*The lift door can sometimes get stuck when you try to open it. *There was building work going on early in the morning at 8am which was quite noisy - so if you want a room that's quieter, let them know in advance.*This is not a negative thing but the location of the hotel is quite tucked out of the way in the city, so do your research beforehand you go so you ensure you know where it is and how to get there.,

*The decorations on the walls in the bathroom is beautiful. *The room itself is nice and spacious and a nicely sized TV.*It had all the facilities we needed for a great stay.*The staff were very friendly and polite.*The reception area is very welcoming and comfy with its hammock style seats.*Breakfast is nice and varied.",positive
"The 3 hour parking outside the apartment (between 8am and 6pm had to keep going back to the car to change the time). Would be good to know this before along with the location of the longer free car parks.,

The fridge was stocked with chargeable drinks, this is brilliant after a long drive and the first thing you want is a cold drink.",positive

Very comfortable bed. Fabulous walk in shower. Excellent lighting in room. Extra touches like fridge, complimentary water & fruit.",positive
"There was some drilling going on when we checked in which was a little off-putting especially as we hadn't been notified of it but as we were out and about this didn't bother us too much.  Although in a nice area we were a bit further from the tourist area/main attractions (25min walk) so bear that in mind for your stay, ideally we would have been a bit closer but there is a metro station close by.,

The hotel was beautiful and has a wow factor foyer area which is very inviting and cosy.   Our room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable.  The unique bathroom tiles were a nice extra touch and the shower was really good.  Staff were very friendly and more than happy to help with any requests.  We didn't have the breakfast there but it did look good from what we saw.",positive
"Great apartment, exceptionally high standard, great location, would definitely recommend.",positive
"Prefer firm mattress, as when used by many travelers, soft mattresses have sink holes. Also,  if there could be quiet hours after 10pm, would be nice.,

Great staff, location.",positive
"Bathroom toilet had a dodgy flush button and ran constantly. As I had a separate bathroom, this wasn't a big problem though.
A reminder it was a cash only payment when booking in would have been appreciated, I had to pop into town to a cash point, luckily i had left plenty of time to get to my ferry crossing!,

Quirky, old world style room with period furnishings. Very comfy bed.
Tea making facilities in the room and an honesty bar downstairs in the kitchen.
Breakfast was great with a bacon and eggs option cooked to order. Plenty of croissants, bread, cheese and meats. Coffee was excellent. 
Staff were friendly and welcoming.

The room was lovely and very comfortable. Room very spacious and has lots of natural light. Room was supplied with hair dryer and kettle which was very thoughtful for ladies. Breakfast was very nice too. It's more than just a normal continental breakfast.  You have hot bread/croissant, fruits, all sorts of jams, cereals, fried egg with bacon, yogurt, juice etc. Would recommend to stay.",positive
"Parking,

Everything was perfect",positive
"The air conditioning was not in English and we could not work out how to turn it down but I am sure if we had of rung natalie she would have explained.,

The accommodation was spotlessly clean and so well equipped they seemed to have thought of everything from the things you would expect  like toiletries and hairdryer, to things you didn't like sweets playing cards and batteries. Excellent and very spacious.",positive
"The parking area was a couple of streets away. However it was very good value at 5 euros a night.,

Accommodation of real charm and character in a quiet neighbourhood on the edge of the city centre, about 15-20 minutes' walk from the cathedral. Excellent breakfast provided by the owner, Jürgen, who made us very welcome and was happy to answer questions about his ecological project in the Congo. There is also a pleasant garden with chairs and tables where guests can relax, have a glass of wine etc.",positive
"Stains on the carpet. Plastic shower door (not suitable for a 4 **** hotel)Holes in the bed sheets. Lamp not working. A lot of little ""details"" not acceptable in a 4**** hotel. Not a good value for money,

Very big and nice House.",negative
"I wish recycle bins got installed in the rooms,

Nice breakfast, fresh products, kind staff, nice room, great location!",positive
"Shut down everything for Covid. I do understand but Booking and website should flag and even then the hotel should at least provide a small kettle in room and provide pro active information to travelers as to how to find something to eat. Decor a bit dated but fine.,

No breakfast available due to Covid.  Hotel location excellent.",positive
This is the most amazing property. A home from home as very well equipped. Excellent host.,positive
"Breakfast in Corona times is no longer fun, because we are missing the choices coming with a buffet. That is NOT the hotels fault! However, the coffee was really tasteless. And the bread was a little stale as well.,

We had to book a suite, because the standard rooms were all booked. We did however not regret having want turned out to be a small appartment! New, comfortably furnished, we really did enjoy the place!",positive
"The overall stay was good. Had a small problem with the room but was sorted straight away when they could not solve the problem by giving me another room. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant was not operating but they had a small takeaway menu that was ok.
The room was comfortable and clean.",positive
"I have nothing to complain about!,

On the one hand the hotel is situated not far from Gare Central! So, there are also good opportunities to reach the important places by various public transport services. By the way, there were bats flying in the inner courtyard of the hotel in the evening. I'd never expected that in a city like Brussels!",positive
"No A/C and if it were any warmer for early September, it would have been very uncomfortable. It would be great to have coffee and tea-making facilities in the room...at the very least, even a small bottle of water once a day. There was also a slight unpleasant smell coming from the bathroom drain, so it may be time for staff to check the plumbing, at least in the room where I stayed.,

I loved the Scandi decor, very cozy. The bathroom was capacious and very comfortable to use. Loved the bathroom tiles.  Breakfast is really well done. The croissants were really good; flaky, not too sweet. Would've loved to have had Belgian waffles/gaufres since I was in Belgium.",positive
"Staff part time,

Nice place. Nice location",negative

The room was great and the attention from the staff",positive

"Everything was perfect for us, except that we get the wrong code to get in at first but the problem was resolved after a quick call the Smartflats Brussel team. We also couldn't turn up the sound of the TV but that was detail for us. Be careful, there is a lot of stairs in a long and narrow staircase so the place is not really appropriate to young kids or old or disable people.,

Perfect location !!! I definitely recommend this place if you are planning to hang out in Brussel Center, no need to use any transportation. The apartment is nice, modern and well appointed, a loft look.  Easy communication with the Smartflats Brussel team if you need informations.",positive

The house is spacious, luxury and homely at the same time. The top floor is a self-containing apartment with bathroom and toilet. The kids liked Netflix on the TV. Nice main bathroom with bath. Sabine is correct and friendly host, gave us two separate front door keys. The parking place is actually a garage box 5 min walk away, safe and secure, but not very big - if you have a big car, check with Sabine first. It is possible to park for a short time in front of the house (20 min free parking).",positive
"The  current available walking path to the beach goes through a semi- construction site and a bike path, but still OK. The surface of the path can be challenging in slippers. I understand that there is another path currently closed down due to works.,

Spacious family room with excellent breakfast ( well arranged in this Covid situation). Location is fine.",positive
"I regret to have noticed that the tables were not cleaned well (with the hands only) nor desinfected for the next customers.Only one young boy had to arrange everything alone for breakfast, some moments really to crowdy and busy, he should have assistance by a second person all the time. He was not able to follow-up in time what was needed or refilled constantly.,

Sufficient choice at breakfast. Very friendly cleaning personnal.Most staff being correct, one male member nevertheless found it important to express his personal opinion that I was not allowed to read my newspaper for some moments in the facilities downstairs while it was even empty, using the very weak excuse that this was meant to be a restaurant. I wonder who will come eat anyway, where the Belgian government has meanwhile decided to close completely for one month all horeca facilities! Anyway, I have never been prohibited to read whatever in the lobby or what so one, I am a client so what? Onlly allowed to sit in the room???Adding as well that 2 of the 3 evenings, there was a blackout of the electricity system, so at least one hour no television and no light in the rooms. But you can not read downstairs ....???Stay a little bit reasonable please.",negative
"Absolutely wonderful stay in a lovely setting with friendly and welcoming hosts. So fun to see the ponies and the windmill,  and to have such easy access to Ghent. Easily the best place we have stayed on booking.com, and so great for the kids. Comfortable and warm. Thank you so much.",positive
"Nothing really ,

Well located , not a usual hotel chain ..",positive
"There could have been night stands and a coffee table. Also since they clean only once a week if you stay a week or more, there could have been more cleaning supplies (a vacuum at least). ,

The location is fantastic and the facilities comfortable. The studio is modern and well designed to maximize space. I would definitely stay there again.",positive

"Everything was perfect.... ,

The apartment was beautiful with nice taste in decoration. Specially the live flowers that I loved to water every afternoon. 
The kitchen fasilaties were perfect and we cook many times and for many people...
The space was grate, and the beds were very comfortable. We had the best sleep in all our stay.
The owner gave us an extra key and a free parking space, and together with all the tips for, locations and places to visit and where to buy breakfast or supermarkets and bakery shops etc, I think she is a super host...
The wifi code is the smarter code we have ever seen and we all noted this. 
In general, 
Beautiful apartment with a nice touch and a quiet neighborhood. Easy to find and not far from the center. 10-15 minute walk and you can have a look in many historical monuments and many sightseeing...
The parking is easy to find, safe and with very small cost per day. (6€-24hours)... since we had a 2nd car that did not fit in the free parking space miss Sabine gave us
Gent is a destination everyone must check out, and 1,2,trois...Le Roi apartment is the place to stay.....
Excellent.....",positive

Location close to the freeway but that was beneficial for me. Comfortable bed",negative
"This is fantastic place to stay. It was for us more like visiting grandparents  than apartment rental. Sandra and Johan are fantastic hosts, very nice and kind. Working windmill in the garden, which they will happily show you, Johans oldtimer cars and tractors, horses and playful dog Maxi are assets you will rarely find in one place. Cherries, their own beer and homemade apple cake Sandra shared with us were also perfect. Our kids enjoyed it as well with go-carts races in the garden and all things around. Simply we had great time here and we hope to be back.",positive
"Breakfast, price, spacious rooms, clean",positive
Adequate gym and great sauna. Lovely and helpful staff. Very quiet place to spend the night.,positive
"They provide a coffee maker but only 2 coffee bags. It is a special kind of bag and you need to go to Lidl to buy them. Considering a whole huge packet of these cost only a couple of Euros, couldn’t these be provided? 
The table is not cosy- metallic. The cable for the coffee maker and kettle needs to cross the cooker - I was worried that I would burn the cable.
For the price, I guess it was fine. ,

Budget accommodation of a fair standard at a great location",positive

Excellently equipped room and bathroom, although very small, with top quality materials, carefully executed.No check out necessary, just drop off your card on the front desk.",positive

Comfortable clean friendly service",positive
"Alot of stairs.  Enough stairs that if you left something on the top floor, you really gave some thought about whether it was worth it go up all those stairs to retrieve it.  If you have mobility issues or knee problems, this property might not work well for you.,

Beautiful modernized traditional Belgian home.  Very clean and well kept.  Only a 10-15 minute walk to the centrum, shopping, and restaurants.  It was a wonderful base to explore Ghent and the surrounding Flanders area (Brugges, Brussels, and Antwerp are all less than an hour away).  Parking is offsite, but only a 3-5 minute walk to a secure garage in a gated enclosure.  Washer and dryer onsite.  The host is very friendly.",positive
"A bit of a walk to the main street of Middelkerke, but we knew that going in. ,

Very large rooms. Very clean. Helpful staff. Fabulous wifi.",positive
"The breakfast could be more fresh and should cater better to vegans. The fruit wasn't fresh, and the eggs were very soggy. In terms of the comfort for the bed, the pillows are terrible. Very thin and not much support. Also the bed is quite sinky so doesn't support your back well if you have pain. ,

The staff were polite and proffesional.",negative
We loved our hosts. They're very friendly. There's a windmill in the property and they showed us inside and explained the whole process. Kids loved the go-carts. The beds were very comfortable. And the property was very clean.,positive

Very nice and helpful staff, really close to historic center, nice aesthetic. Clean and solid.",positive
"In the bathroom of the room, the shower soap was empty and despite that they clean the room, they never refill it. I wound't expect this for such a hotel.,

The hotel is very well decorated. The breakfast was simple but good. The staff was friendly. Recommendable hotel.",positive
"Friendly staff
Nice room
Great breakfast",positive
"Not a dislike, but something that some travellers might need to be aware of: the stairs in the property are relatively steep and narrow but many houses & restaurants in the area are like this.,

The property is fabulous and extremely good value for money.  Three of us spent a few days in Flanders, sightseeing and drinking the wonderful beer and this was an excellent base for day-trips to both Bruges and Ieper.  We also enjoyed the walk into Ghent city centre as well as the proximity to the nearby Trappistenhuis beer pub/bar.  The house has great facilities and loads of space.  Parking nearby in a lockable garage was a real bonus, as on-street parking is a challenge.  Sabine was the perfect host - communication before arrival and at the end of our stay was excellent.  Highly recommended.",positive
"Personally pillows are not that comfortable and not supporting the neck at all which unfortunately slept not that well and energy recharged. 
Small detail: Ping pong rackets have to be changed...

Very nice hosted by Raymond, very kind and amazingly serviced with his professionalism.
Facility is great for little and big kids.  Next door is a Karting, bowling, adventure entertainment for big kids.
Safety measures are well respected, gels, very clean place.

Parking is great, not to worry to find a place!",positive

Room is clean, beds are very comfortable",positive
"The safe in the room was very small. Could have had more plug points near the bed to allow for phones to charge nearby,

Large and clean rooms. Had a view of the Parc Cinquantennaire from the room. All required toiletries were provided including things like  sewing kit, bathing caps, makeup removal products, shoe polish etc. Sauna was well equipped, clean and private. Hotel is not in a noisy area and close to the metro and Parc Cinquantennaire and good restaurants nearby",positive
"It couldn't be improved.,

We loved everything about stay in the townhouse, it really was exceptional. Upon arrival we were greeted by Sabine, who was so welcoming and friendly. She took time to show us around the house which was perfect, very clean and tidy. Well presented and exactly like the pictures. She was even kind enough to put a welcome pack of food and drinks in the fridge. She showed us how to get to our destination and the best route to take. I cannot recommend staying highly enough, it was a perfect visit and we are hoping to visit again next year.",positive

The room was very spacious for the price and everything felt proper. Would stay there again.",positive

Good location for onward travel, not far from motorway. Has a decent bar and food available. There is also a good supermarket about 5 minute walk away. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Very basic, but all I expected and needed.",positive
"We had very much enjoyed our stay at De Rosmolen. Thank you Sara and Johan for your hospitality! We would definitely recommend to everybody. The place is beautiful and it is conveniently close to Antverps, Brugg and Ghent city. If we could, we would give 11/10!",positive
"very calm place, perfect place to sleep well with family.",positive
Excelent place to stay..!,positive
"Bad communication in advance: I got the information to pick up the keys in the tea room but it is closed on Thursdays. So I got another address. This was fine but I had no information on which floor the flat was situated. The name on the ring was not the same and we needed help of the neighbars. 
Booking confirmation says that 90% has to be paid in advance so I thought my credit card was charged as written on the confirmation. But this wasn't the case and as nobody gave us some information we drove to our next place and will have to do a bank transfer. This situation could be avoided. ,

Nice flat, closed to the beach",positive
"Some parts were nicely modernized (ceilings), other parts require it and some need it now. Some carpets were worn, chairs severely damaged, curtains had holes, the men's sauna seating are broken.,

The staff is very nice, helpful and amazing. The location is great and everything is very clean. The breakfast was good, abundant but not exceptional in choice (number of cheeses could be higher)",positive

Friendly staff, location (close to park that's especially excellent start for early morning runners)",positive
"The only issue is the steps leading upstairs. They are extremely slippery, especially if you are wearing socks. The steps on the last floor are even more narrow and more slick. If you have kids, they need to be careful walking down. ,

The property is clean and in a decent area. We were able to park our minivan on the street and only had to pay €6 per day for parking. The property is located about 1.2 miles from most of the restaurants and shopping so it’s a perfect way to eat and still get your exercise in at the end of the day. The owner of the property is extremely friendly and speaks great English.",positive

Lots of retail and restaurant options within easy walking distance. Facilities were clean and bright. Safe neighborhood. We had a two bed room, lots of natural lighting. We were able to check in early.",positive
"At check-in they requested my ID-card, and they forgot to give it back to me. Even at checkout, they did not give it back, it was only because I was an other hotel the night after and I realised that my ID-card was gone ... At check-in they did not tell me that breakfast was NOT included. If I had known, I would not have taken breakfast. Because at checkin I had to pay for it. Unnecessary. Bad communication at check-in.",negative

"Boiler went on all night, making quite a bit of noise, which made sleeping problematic. Towels (for shower...) were not provided and this was not mentioned anywhere. We were told to bring bed sheets....but nothing re towels. It would have been nice to know about this.,

Great Location.",negative
"If I am really critical I would say the shower is too hard, it almost hurts. The last thing is that the roof terrace should be available for visitors of the hotel before other guests from outside. Everyone had to wait in the same row and it was a long row! You are advertising with the roof top but it's not clear that it is not very accessible for guests.,

I really liked the staff they are very friendly and helpful. Also the bed is very comfortable and the room was comfortable and clean, The roof terrace is amazing and great for a drink.",positive
"There was a very strong vinegar-like smell of cleaning detergents that did not go away after airing the place.,

Great location, very comfortable apartment with wonderful view on Grand Sablon.",positive
In every way it was nice,positive
"The hotel is really nicely decorated in Scandinavian style. It is located in quiet street but still just few steps away from a busy shopping street and walking distance from the old city centre. The room was very basic but extremely clean and comfortable. I have rarely seen this clean hotel rooms. The bathroom wall was glass whis might be an issue to some people. I mean it is not see through but not far from it.  The breakfast was good. Fresh bread and pastry, variety of warm options, yogurt, cereal and muesli. Nothing really especial though for Scandinavian taste where you often find smoked salmon, herring or different cheese options as well. However I can't complain. The only thing is that they could clean the breakfast tables a bit faster when people leave. I must say I really enjoyed my stay an would definitely recommend this hotel.",positive

"Just a note for an otherwise pleasant, lively and excellent value for money hotel: If there is a need to place reminders about security (thieves looking like you and me) it is probably appropriate to also have some extra security as one goes up to the rooms (e.g. doors at every floor or elevator operating with the card keys).,

The ampartment design was nice",negative

The were no Iron board in my room and I tried to contact the reception and houskeeping  but nobody aswered the phone. Also they charge €10 for the entree to the rooftop....even if you're a guest. That is ridiculous. I was very disappointed☹️ regarding the rooftop. At C/O the receptionist didn't even ask how my stay was, so I remain quiet.,

Great bed and pillow! I had 2 amazing night sleeping on their bed!😃
Location is excellent!",negative

"Very small bed and even smaller quilt, so I didn't get proper sleep.I booked the best western specifically because I remembered their huge double beds (at least in the US), but the bed in my room was so small i could barely fit and I am not a big woman. Also, the quilt was quite small and every time I moved, a part of my body was left exposed. Finally, I am not a big fan of carpet, it always feels like it's not that cleanand there was a big ruined spot by the bathroom.,

Good size for a single room. Very quiet, even though the hotel was fully booked. Very close to the metro station. Nice view from the window. Kettle +coffee and tea provided (but weird creamer thing instead of milk). The bathroom had a bathtub which is always a plus. Free wi-fi. Free bottle of water on first day.",negative

Service as we arrived. Girl was so nice!",positive
"Lake all similar places in central Brussels, very steep stairs but this something which you cannot avoid anyway. Will be good to have at least a bottle of water upon arrival (especially when it is late).,

I will start with the very convenient location - walking distance from city center as well as Gare Centrale and metro. Plenty of space in the apartment and very cozy atmosphere - much better than a hotel and definitely very good value for money. There is a bakery nearby which opens early in the morning. Clean and very spacious bath with daylight.",positive

Very reasonable priced Hotel with great hospitality.,positive
"-More like a good 3 stars hotel rather than a 4 stars one-Limited breakfast options for a 4 stars hotel-The staff was very helpful BUT there was not enough staff.

The Hotel's location in the city center makes it easy for transportation and shopping.,positive
"It was stated in the description that there is not elevator, but reality with quite steep and narrow staircase was little bit ""too much"". Definitely won't recommend it to heavy smokers or similar - will be quite a challenge to get upstairs. However it will motivate you to spend more time in the city and come back to apartments only for sleep.,

Location was nice. Majority of most known chocolatiers has their shops almost next door ( and some of them really next door) to apartments. The nearby square is quite full of people, but location at the 3rd floor fade you away from loudness even with open windows. Checkin via email with codes of access instead of keys - nice idea.",positive

"The outside seating area is modern and spacious, with a great bench in the shade, but as it faces the entrance/driveway/courtyard of the owners house, there is sometimes a bit of lack of privacy with coming and goings.The kitchen did not have a lot of storage options when you bring your own food, which might be an issue for larger groups.,

Great holiday house, fully equipped with modern standards and nicely decorated. Three bedrooms each with their own bathrooms and toilets.Great location close to nature, some nice walks that can be taken starting from the house.

"Unfortunately the temperature of the house couldn’t be adjusted manually. The house was therefore around 17-18 degrees which was too cold for us, especially in the bed room where the baby slept. The owner gave us a mobile heater which helped a bit to heat the bed room.,

Peaceful place, clean and spacious with 3 bathrooms. Huge bath for 2 persons. Kitchen has everything you need. You can park your car just in front of the house. The owner lives next door, but the house gives you enough privacy. The house was made very cosy with a Christmas tree.",positive
"The rooms need to be refreshed a bit. Some furniture need some repair, deep cleaning or being replaced.  I'm not saying the hotel is not clean or needs big works. it's just that everything has lifespan and some things in the hotel need attention. ,

But now  a experience  I never had before :because it was hot in the room also, we did open the two -balcony- doors for some fresh air( third floor ! ) , but there was no balcony and no bars. There was nothing, only the deep.So : we could have fallen down in the dark( we expected a balcony ) .  This was  a danger for life situation !!!

An excellent place to stay if you are looking for a peaceful rest in the country side. Property is done with taste, well maintained, impeccably clean and hosts are incredibly kind and forthcoming. Our stay with a little baby was made very comfortable with a cot and high chair for the little one. We had a triple room with amazing bath and sauna. Breakfast is home made and fresh with wide variety of pastries, meat, cheese and much more for every taste. We will definitely come back when the open-air swimming pool is open in summer. Well done!",positive

"We had to ring to enter the hotel.  The receptionist appeared in gym kit and socks with no shoes on.  We checked in for four (prepaid nights).  But the next night our cards didn't work and the same underdressed receptionist appeared.  He reset our cards but nevertheless they still didn't work on the third night.  This time a different more efficient receptionist did the job.  One day our room wasn't cleaned although we were out from 9am until 6pm,

As it was during lockdown there were no facilities open and nobody even at the reception desk.",negative

We went to the Truck Grand Prix in Zolder. The race track can be reached on foot in half an hour. It is not a luxury hotel that we did not expect and did not book. But it is a very good family-run country hotel. The friendliness of the owners and the cleanliness should be emphasized. There are free parking spaces available and the owner takes you directly to the race track with a small bus free of charge.Thanks a lot and keep it up!",positive

The property was extremely clean and in a good location. Parking was free, which was great ! 
But the bed wasn't very big and it wasn't very comfortable. My husband didn't sleep well. 
The room wasn't very big either. 
The staff at reception was extremely unfriendly. The cleaning lady was very nice and polite though ! But unfriendly staff at reception/check in kind of spoiled it.
Next time I will stay in an Ibis budget because it's much better value for money.",negative

We were greeted by our host Marie Louise and given a list of places to eat nearby and she offered us bikes to get there as we had a problem with the car. We had a fantastic breakfast , lots of choice. Tea and coffee available all day and evening in the breakfast area. Unfortunately, it was only an overnight stay. I would have been very happy to stay longer. Our son and daughter-in-law were given a discount too on arrival as our Grandson was so young.

Everything was perfect. Beautiful B&BKindness of the owner",positive
"Internet: The Internet connection of the hotel is extremely slow. Free Internet only has 15Mbps download speed and another option is paid Internet at 30Mbps for €9.99... very terrible. It's 2020 now and I am using 1Gbps Internet at home already, 15Mbps can do almost nothing. Bed: I am reserving for a king size bed but I got a ""King size bed"" combined by two single beds. One thing even worth, the bed mattress moved by itself, so there is a relatively large space between the two bed mattress.,

Decoration: The decoration of the room is very adorable. We like it.Location: 5 Mins walking from the center area of Bruges, a lot of restaurants near by.Breakfast: different choices, especially the fried eggView: Canal and garden viewGarden: This hotel has a very adorable garden.",positive

"It is a youth hostel, and for that level accommodation I didn't think much could be better.,

It s a youth hostel so it has everything you need and little more. Everything was clean, comfortable, and the courtyard was a wonderful space to enjoy with kids.

We had originally booked the same hotel but in Brussels Schuman station. Due to Covid restriction, they moved us to the Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel in the center for the same price and the situation went way beyond our expectations. Very central and very convenient location for visiting all the main attractions of Brussels, apartment equipped with all the desirable needs even for cooking something, friendly staff.",positive

Breakfast was loads to choose from
Restaurant menu is fantastic",positive
"There is no way this is a 5 star hotel. All the furniture in the room is old and also the tv seems to be from the 2000's. Thr bathroom door is not finished and also there were no complementary products for the guest. As we arrived in the room there was only one robe and one pair of house slippers. Somehow unnaceptable for a 5 star residence. Not to forget the 50 euro warranty blocked from our credit card,

Location. Excelent - right in the heart of the city
Clean.",positive

Close to the city center. Beautiful ‘old’ Belgian city house. 
Comfortable 2 bedroom apartment with comfortable beds! Nice small but practical kitchen, spacious bathroom. It’s cosy, clean and you can also sit outside in their garden or take a plunge in the pool. 
The hosts were very friendly and responsive. Breakfast was great and I really appreciated the fact that Sylvie bought some dairy free products especially for me!",positive

Everything was good",negative
"There is a big problem, because the hotel does not have air conditioning and if you are going in summer, end of June and beginning of July, you will receive only a portable fan which is insufficient. So for this price and a little extra pay I could have stayed in a 4 star hotel with AC. It is sad because the hotel was recently renovated and they should have taken this aspect into account.,

Good location just 20 minutes walk to all major landmarks. Good array of shops near the hotel. Clean room, they changed the towels on a daily basis. Good breakfast although they tend to close it at 10 sharp.",positive

Very easy check in and out. Staff were pleasant and spoke good English.",negative
"Some weirdness with the internet connection stability and safety (got some red flags from connection security apps) throughout the stay, which can be bothersome to people travelling on business. But as far as I understood, it was a general problem all across Leuven with this internet provider during the days of my stay. Hopefully it is true.,

Swift and open communication with the host, cleanliness, as well as quality/price ratio. Good location too. Would stay again.",positive
"Lovely small details, fire place",positive
"Highly recommendable!!!!!! This is the cottage you have to book when visiting Bruges. The house is very spacious yet cosy. You can relax in the spacious garden and eat at the covered terrace on sunny days. Everything was extremely clean and all of our questions were answered promptly by the owner. The house is very close to the center (15 min walk) and the bus stop in front of the house is perfect for rainy days. We are definitely coming back next year!",positive
Doggy area and the ladies at the breakfast were a bit unpolite.,negative

"It’s a badly designed hotel. Rooms are too small for a 3 star property. The family room we booked was on 5th floor but the elevator was up to 4th floor only. The room was so hot and there was no A/c. It was impossible to carry all our luggage to the top. When asked, the hotel staff gave us a double room on 1st floor which was very small and there was no window for the room. The receptionist was kind enough to give us a fan which as per him ‘is the best fan in Brussels’. It made a motor running sound but there was no use of it. ,

It’s a new hotel with limited facilities.",negative

the owner is very good and helpful",positive
"BUT the hotel has no air condition, which is normally no problem in Brussels, but during these days in June the temperature in the room is above 25C! If you open the window it is almost impossible to sleep. Even if it is a side street it seems that people drive races in the road. Additionally a lot of loud people pass during the night. This means a no go for summer. A real pity as I liked the hotel style. I had also last morning a baguette which was so dry that I assume it was at least one day old....,

The Hotel has a very nice architecture with really nice rooms in a renovated old building. The staff is friendly  and the coffee is great as well.",negative

"You have to go up a steep, narrow staircase to get to the room (no lift). We struggled a little with the luggage. Not really a complaint, but something to be aware of for people with less mobility.,

Good sized, comfortable room, spotlessly clean, and the cutest little balcony. No breakfast is available (as stated), but there is coffee making facilities, a fridge and a microwave in the room, and there are plenty of cafes nearby too. Good communication with the host.",positive
"We loved everything! The only suggestion I would make which is *very minor* is to replace the can-openers as both were broken. Overall this place was perfect! ,

Perfect location, a 10 minute walk from the central station.  We felt right at home in the huge property, which was warm and cosy and had enough space to fit 9 of us comfortably. Excellent facilities with fully equipped kitchen. Beautifully decorated with a large living and kitchen area. We’d love to come back when the weather is warmer so that we could make use of the large garden and bbq facilities. Would recommend to families and large groups. Loved our stay!",positive

The garden",negative

Great location, very comfortable and nice breakfast.",positive
"There is no air conditioned. For a 3 stars hotel which charges you 170 Euros/night, it is totally unacceptable. In summer (my stay was in June)  you have to sleep with the windows opened and there is some noise in the streets. I was also disappointed when I arrived, there was only one person at the reception who does everything (bar tender, answers to the phone, receptionist). I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my room key..... Here again, for that category of hotel and associated price, you expect a better service for your money.,

Breakfast is correct but not exceptional. The personal is friendly and politeThe design is modern and nice",negative

"Only a small niggle: although we went down to breakfast at about 07.30 there really wasn’t much left to eat - just as well we were in a hurry to get on the road....,

Pretty much everything- staff were very friendly and helpful, the hotel and the room were clean, tidy and comfortable And we enjoyed a drink in the bar and an early breakfast. Very good value for money. If we can find a Tulip Hotel near where we want to go next time we travel we shall book our stay there.",positive
"No breakfast, but was mentioned on booking.com and there is a bakery nearby.,

The rooms looks very new & modern and were equipped with a luxury bathroom with great rain shower. Plus points for having a microwave and a fridge in the room.

We will come back in the future for sure!",positive
"May need some minor refreshing to décor, etc in near future?Whilst generally well located and in a quiet neighbourhood, it is a bit too far from the centre of Bruges for an easy stroll.,

Very spacious and comfortable.",positive
"Well, one of the cleaning lady did take my sheets before my leave and by doing it, threw my earplugs on the floor. She then broom one of em and trashed it. Buuutttt!!! The staff did give me 2 free of charge in exchange! This is pretty much the only problem I got beside other guests being loud.,

Place feel brand new, the breakfast is awsome, the cleaning crew seems to clean everyday. The sheets were perfectly clean.",positive
"You get what you pay for. It’s the cheapest accommodation in the area and it’s fine for an overnight stop.  I wouldn’t want to stay longer as it is remote and there are no places to eat nearby.,

(Me at least)",positive
"The staff at the reception and their unfriendly attitude.,

Very rude staff at the reception. No consideration for the family nor customer service experience. Instead of being sorry about room that were not in the block for the family and also single bed instead if king size bed. We were told this is what we have take it or leave it since reservation is with Booking.com.Furthermore we we asked for the manager they indicated that we have to come back on Monday.Very disappointing experience!",negative

The smell in the bathroom was very unpleasant.,positive
"something like tomatoes, gherkins or cucumber to go with the breakfast would be nice - the meat and cheese, whilst nice, were ""dry"" to eat.,

Last visit, we were delayed and very late, but they stayed-up so that we could get-in, despite it being so late - no words of acrimony. Very accommodating. Drinks in the fridge available, on the honour system - it is so nice to be trusted! I'd wanted to stay overnight a couple of months ago, but they were full - not at all surprising!I look forward  to staying there again in future.",positive
"No Bathrobes,

Location and the way the staff handled the c19 issue",positive

Specifically the breakfast fresh juice in a short glass ware tre bien❣️",positive
Τhe lighting in the room was awfull,negative

"No grumbles at allb,

Made welcome and comfortable - Marie Louise and Hugo could not have been more helpful , it enhanced my experience immensely",positive
"Nothing really... to be picky, a separate shower (not in bath) would be good.,

Charming old era renovated hotel. Room with comfort had very high ceilings, windows etc. Very spacious plus large separate bathroom. Staff were all good and very helpful (especially with the ice for evening drinks) arranging for train tickets etc.   One of the best places we have  visited over the past 2 months in Europe.",positive
"As mentioned, super breakfast but we missed some chocolate spread. Scrambled eggs and, although the croissants were delicious, a bit more choice of pastries would also have been nice, particularly on a Sunday ;-),

Friendly and professional staff, always ready to help. Clean and quiet bedroom. Well-connected location, especially when traveling by car. Excellent breakfast (fresh orange juice!).",positive
"The hotel is ideal for latecomers - walking distance from the train station and self check-in. Most of the hotels and B&B's do not accept guest arriving after 22-00. Room is spacious enough, clean and cozy, I found everything I needed and even more than you can get in a big hotel. Excellent value for money.",positive
"Kitchen was not so good equipped. Outdoor furniture was a little bit old and used already.,

"Dormitory beds were not very clean when I arrived (previous bed sheets were still on, and some sweets were left behind on the bed... though these might be a bit hard to control on the hostel's side).,

Warm, friendly staff at the reception; clean, functional and sufficient WCs and shower areas on each floor; breakfast included (very basic with hot beverages, toasts and cereals, but with some fruits); fully functional kitchen and plenty of cozy space in the common areas to chill alone or in groups.",positive

Hotel was in a good location and breakfast was good. Rooms were a good size and the bed was very comfortable.",positive
"Although the hotel itself is quite Grand the room we were in was dated, the tap to the sink leaked every time it was used and as soon as the room next door used their water our water pressure dropped significantly.,

The staff were helpful and kind. The buffet breakfast was incredible, probably the best I’ve had at a hotel. Lovely bar downstairs. The gym had some basic equipment that was fine for a quick workout.",positive
25 euro for breakfast is too much,positive

Positive experience, should stay there in case of next visits!",positive
"The day is arrival he told us to pay 80 euros more in cash , of course he said also we were free to cancel , so at the end it was more money that what we pay with the card in the day of booking ... this was the only thing we didn’t felt comfortable doing, and well , it was easier to pay than to start looking another place . Besides this everything was nice .,

The room (facing the beautiful inner yard) was very quiet, very clean room and bathroom, very friendly staff. The breakfast was more than rich with a huge variety of things.",negative
"Breakfast rather poor even by Hotel Formule1 standards. Hotel not easy to find when coming from Liege on a non-motorway route, due to roadworks in the vicinity and very poor signage of how to negotiate them and to find the hotel,,

A former Hotel Formule1, which could do with updating.  But ok for a night.",positive

Very friendly staff, nice quiet room with free parking.  Bastogne is an interesting location with a number of fine museums.

"Unfortunately it was very hot when we there- there was no air conditioning or fan in the room which made the room unbearably hot, we had to leave the window open which unfortunately still didn't solve the problem and was very noisy with the road running behind and being eaten by mosquitoes - this is the reason for my low score as it just made for an unenjoyable night there,

Rooms were quite spacious and were clean. Easy parking. Food in the restaurant was nice (once we got the correct orders!)",negative

Cold room,positive
"The house itself is quite charming but there was a huge number of flies around which invaded the living room. This was alright in itself (to be expected in the countryside), if the owner later had not used it as a cynical excuse to deduct money from our deposit. I understand that times during the quarantine are difficult, but when you charge 700 euros for three nights, perhaps deducting another 100 on top is a bit ridiculous. Something also about us not using our own bed linen (untrue, and a ridiculous claim anyway),

The house was nice, as was the location, but the owner and his cynical ways of trying to squeeze more money out of an already expensive property ruined the trip for us. The Ardennes is welcoming and beautiful, but the management was not.",negative
"maybe the price 120 Euro is a bit high ( … breakfast is not included  ) … but i think it 's in the average for a Tourist town .,

Breakfast was good. Not exceptional for a European buffet, but good value for the money.",positive
"Our room was located just on top of the outdoor which caused some noise, but the staff was very willing to change the room - we had just unpacked everything so changing wasn't really an option. The staff also talked with the guests hanging out outside, which solved the problem. The aircon in the room was fine with the temperature control, also made it warmer. The only thing affecting the comfortability was the smell. There was a bit stuffy smell in the room mostly due to the carpet flooring. The aircon flters might also needed to check a bit more frequently.,

Breakfast was worth the money, room was very nice. Lobby shop had everything you could need. Very helpful and friendly, polite staff! Nice, fresh decor.",positive

We booked this B&B for the festival Antilliaanse feesten. This location was a full halfhour drive to the festival back and forth.

The owner and host Hilde was really friendly and booked an evening meal for us at one of the local restaurants, prior to our arrival.  She was very responsive to questions and the breakfast was also very good with delicious pastries, fruit etc and eggs and bacon if you wanted them.  Everywhere was exceptionally clean and it was a 15/20 minute walk to the town centre.   We had the 2 bedroom apartment which was really lovely, with a wonderful shower and comfy beds.  It had a small kitchenette and a fridge which is always a bonus and a living area.",positive

Very close to subway. Big hotel, well organized.",negative
"We didn't like the sound of the water pipe at night. We thought that someone was using our sink more than 10 minutes, but it was actually the sound of the water pipe in the bathroom (under the sink) which came from the guests above us who were taking a shower in the middle of the night! It was so silly!!! We couldn't sleep nicely at that night (arround 2-3 o'clock in the morning).We didn't like the shower in the bathroom, the floor when it is wet can be so dangerous for the kids. I would not recommend any family with kids to stay here without the floor towel. The bathroom was dirty. It is cleaned necesarilly, not very clean. When we entered our hotel room, we only brought some bed lines without the matrass covers! Then we had to go back to the lobby to take the matras covers. We couldn't also make the baby travel bed ourselves in our hotel room, but the receptionist had helped us after we brought it again to the lobby.We like the breakfast, it has good of choices. We like the main floor (it's design, ineterieurs, furnitures, etc.) from the lobby, the game room, the breakfast room and the hall. We also like the friendly staffs of its hotel. As for the first timers guests who stayed here, we have to adapt ourselves with everything. But maybe we would like to stay at other budget hotels if we ever return to Liege which location has directly parking place :),

We like the lobby, the breakfast and the friendly of the staffs",negative
"The gym was toooo small. Not enough weights. Very old.
The pillows in the room were wither too small or too large.
The bathroom sink had nothing to stop an item from falling inside for example a lid or a ring. ,

Loved the breakfast. Friendly staff. Great location. Sometimes it worth paying more quality of hotel if staying in Brussels for one night like this.
I forgot about the bathroom. The shower is super powerful (grohe shower head) and the water is very fast compared to London.",positive

Great location, after working out the check in process it was all really easy.",positive

"Old linen beds,

"Wifi!!!!!!!!!,

Situation",positive
Great breakfast then I,positive
"My only complaint was the lack of vegan food options.  Especially in the market area inside the hotel.  When arriving late at night and when everthing in the area is closed, some vegan food options would be a major plus.  This could be a sandwich, or one of the pizzas as there are many vegan frozen pizza options out now. I am not saying that you need to have loads of vegan foods but one or two (a sandwich and pizza) would be nice.  You may not think it would be popular but if you carried it I'm sure you would see if move.,

The location was pretty good. It was walking distance to some great sites, the location was safe and the area was very clean.  The hotel halways are looking a little bit dated as is the bedroom carpets but the I found the entire hotel to be clean which is the most important. But for the price, I felt I got what I paid for and overall I was happy and I would stay again.",positive

"The hot water did not work well. We stayed for 3 nights, I was the 2nd one to take the hot shower, but unluckily the hot water suddenly turned cold after the hair shampoo for two times. I have advised to the reception staffs on the 1st and during check out. They both advised if 1st guest takes a hot shower, the 2nd guests have to wait for 45 mins to heat the water. It’s really frustrated. There are less stores and restaurants near the aparthotel, it’s recommend to have the dinner at city center before returning the aparthotel.,

The aparthotel is close to metro stations, also is conveniently most attractions by bus. Staffs were nice.",positive

It was perfectly adequate and offered excellent value for money. Rooms are Clean, beds & bathrooms are OK. I was at the rear on a higher floor and it was quiet enough. I would consider staying here again.",negative

"I booked the hotel for my parents, while I stayed somewhere else. I like the studios in Aparthotel Adagio (I already stayed in one of their studios in Strasbourg), because they give you the possibility to put beverages in the fridge and use glasses and forks, so you feel a little bit more at home in this hotel. Everything was clean and the bathroom was very beautiful.I asked the hotel to get breakfast together with my parents and they booked and additional breakfast for me without any problems.

- more reasonable prices  of the little restaurant required. It is not worth it to eat there at the moment.

"Highly advertised location but promises just promises – as matter of fact a ‘never to return establishment’ – unless you fancy the stench of cow dung first thing in the morning when opening the window.  Upon entering the Guesthouse your first experience will be painful (and continues to get worse) – door frames are perfect for people < 180 cm. I am just 185cm and constantly banged my head somewhere. We had a family room consisting of two bedrooms (Master and Children). The beams in the ‘child’s room’ were 183cm high, in the master room 179cm. No hazard tape anywhere! Good paper listed choice of breakfast – in reality the selection of cheese or ham or jam was precision measured. For each slice of bread half a slice of above mentioned.
Other example: - standard boiled egg (anywhere in the world eggs are boiled hard for sanitary reasons), here so soft as if the hen just dropped it and therefore saved the Hosts the effort to heat up some water.
Our family room (though we booked it as a couple without children) was advertised and presented so with a sauna. You may guess by now: Fake news!
Yes, there is a 2 person home built sauna on the second floor – but only available from 5pm to 7 pm and extra charge of 5E p/p. This is for the sauna only – not even having a tub nor shower.
Major highlight was our last day in this location:
We were told that one of the beds is needed for a family of five arriving soon.
Upps, within minutes the bed was gone….. I want to say that we reserved and paid consciously for a family room for us as a couple without kids, as it was largest room available (with sauna advertised) at time of booking.
Sorry for my sarcasm, but it best describes this location. The hosts perfected the art of saving any nickel and dime while attempting to appear the best ***in the area.
They also have own Farm products for sale like cheese and marmalade etc…. Be aware, I bought one marmalade to complement the (precision measured breakfast) jam.,

Nothing really – location is what it is: a one horse village in middle of nowhere – next available Supermarket (lol: a ‘Grandma’s convenience store’ at best) is miles away.",negative
"Great place to stay on business, well signed from main road from every direction, good parking, comfortable rooms and great breakfast, everything you need when you are travelling on business, will stay again when I am in the region.",positive
"There weren’t any simple tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Breakfast wasn’t included in the price (as with many competitors). There was an unpleasant smell that came from bathroom occasionally, smelled a bit like drains. There was also a large damp patch on the ceiling of the bathroom. The worst part about the room (room number 4) was that it was right by the hotel lobby and was therefore very noisy. We could hear every time the front door slid open and close, people talking in the lobby, music from the lobby etc. The Hotel isn’t in the nicest part of town and a good 25 mins to the centre.,

The decor is really good and the rooms nicely furnished. Good sized bed, excellent shower. Quiet location (downside - further away from amenities)",negative
"Nothing that we did not like,

Everything was perfect, the room was so clean and spacious, the staff were all very helpful. Breakfast had plenty of choice, including champagne! The hotel was beautiful and right by canal. Only 5 minute walk to the main square.",positive
"I couldn't adjust the Aircon, or rather I could but it kept resetting to 21 and I didn't want it that warm for sleeping (also there is no off button). Also breakfast bought in the hotel is very expensive. The bath in a standard room is only helpful if you are short. I'm 5'11"" and it was comical...,

Fabulous location, helpful staff and comfortable beds... Thankfully the windows open properly because it's a European hotel and not a silly English one which only opens 2""",positive
"I had problem to prepare my food, I asked for a kitchenette, you answered that there was one but a small stove was missing and the capsule coffee maker did not work.,

I didn´t use breakfast service.",negative

"The bed for 2 prs is very small and the room was not very clean ,

The localisation and the staff",positive
"No tea / coffee making facilities in the room, no air con, slow lifts. But, despite the few shortcomings, you get more than you pay for here.,

My room was a fair size, the bathroom perfectly reasonable, the bed was comfortable, good choice of lighting options in the room and a view over the rooftops of old Antwerp. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The location is perfect, just next to Central station.",positive
"There is breakfast but thee is served only when asked for.The woman didn't say a good morning to us... a bit weird..",negative
Fantastic b&b. Couldn’t be more friendly or helpful. Would def go back and will recommend to friends,positive
"We paid extra for a superior room but had a staircase in our room which took up the majority of the room but served no purpose as it went nowhere. A coffee machine in the room would be good and shampoo.,

The decor in the main areas.",negative
"Little bit tired, needs some TLC. Light bulbs not working, paint quite scratched, paper peeling in places ,

Nice old building, quaint and felt like an authentic Brugge experience. Good upgrade and huge rooms. Staff were excellent upon arrival but ambivalent other times.",positive
"Towels old,,

Excellent location , friendly staff , metro very close",positive
"The only negative experience which ruined my entire experience was with one staff. At about 10.30pm on a Saturday, I was watching sports on TV and didn't even think the volume was loud. So heard a knock on the door, I was on my shorts with no shirt so wanted to put on a shirt before answering the door. Before I could get to the door, the staff (a lady) opened the door. So I was socked and asked who she was and she said she was an employee, so i got to the door and she told me that i was disturbing and that everything had to be turned off or down after 10pm. Mindful, I was only watching football on TV with a low volume. So I asked her why she opened the door and she said she had knocked three times with no response and as a result had the right to open the door. There was a telephone in the room, so I asked her why didn't she call the telephone? she could not answer and was staring at me like a clueless chicken. What is the point of providing customers phones in their room if you can't use it to contact your customers? I was fuming, because if i was naked in the toilet, she would have entered my room and seen me naked? The hotel claims to provide customers their privacy but this is not correct. She was very rude and was talking to me in a high tone, then asked me not to raise my voice when she was also raising her voice. I told her off and slammed the door against her face. Surely the last time I will ever use this hotel.,

Property was clean. Good location.",negative
"Needed little more ventilation. Was a little warm,

Best shower ever!",positive
"no fresh milk with the breakfast.,

very good breakfast, plenty of choice.we arrived early and did not expect the hotel to have a room available for us, but they said give us 10 minutes and we will have a room available for you. and they did ! we were able to leave our bags in a safe room on the final day of our stay and collect later",positive

Everything was great about his hotel. The woman at the desk greeted me from checking every morning with a friendly smile and spoke fantastic English. Breakfast was very good. The rooms are immaculately clean . Even the cleaning woman greets you with a smile and a hello each morning,positive
I stayed for 4 nights and at the and the bathroom became quite dirty and towels as well. If the person stays longer than 2 night it would be nice to clean the property.,positive

The Hospitality of Hilde and the materials used in the interior,positive
"Too hot - radiators off.No lift to my apartment.No water, coffee mahone in room.Broken lift. Staff didn’t offer anything after found out about lift.,

Coffee machine in the room and water will be good. 5th floor apartment need to go on stairs with your luggage and cold morning from one building to other not perfect as well. Lift was broken so I had to carry luggages with my family. Make sure you avoid booking rooms on 5th floor",negative

Fine breakfast service",positive
"Friendly staff, lovely hotel, vgood breakfast, great location. Quiet location in town with lots of free parking. Very short walk to town centre steeped in wwii history. Short drive to the fox holes where the 101s and the museum not far from that too and pattons memorial.",positive

"the apartament lacks in ""love to detail"", no sockets in the kitchen, the sofa bed did not open properly (and we needed it because we are a family of 5 and there was 2 double beds and one sofa bed), there was watermarks everywhere in the bathroom and in the kitchen... , small details that when remedied would make for a great apartment,

Perfect location direct in the heart of Antwerpen, direct in the Meir. The apartment door works with a code, what makes pretty easy to check in. The apartament has great large rooms with everything we need for a short stay. It was clean and airy. It could use a bit of love though.",negative
"Parking prices and extra special add on prices e.g. champagne,

Location, helpful staff, Canal view",positive
Everything was outstanding. No more to say.,positive
"Nothing,

Lovely welcome, comfortable, airy bedroom, beautiful breakfast.  The area felt safe and there were restaurants available within an easy 10 minute walk.  Even though it's near a road you couldn't hear anything, it just made the property more accessible.",positive
"Unfortunately there were NO towels in the bathroom. Just one floor towel and one small hand towel in the toilet. So that was a bummer after the shower ... Oh, and a bottle of handsoap is not shower soap ...,

Very clean apartment. I could stay here for a couple days maybe even weeks if I had to.Bed was ok and very clean as well. Even the sofa in the living room was made although I didn't need it. Easily sleeps 4 ppl (2+2). I didn't really mind the stairs to the 5th floor.",negative

Nice and clean apartment in close proximity to public transport.",positive

"Really a perfect stay! I stayed here with a colleague for a work trip in the area. The host went beyond to make our stay comfortable and took extra effort in arranging a table at a local restaurant for us. The rooms are super comfortable, the breakfast is delicious and the overall B&B is beautifully decorated. I would stay here again for sure.",positive
"The only negative thing that caught my attention were the carpets! They were very old, with some dubious stains. With the beds being very low, you could see everything!,

Loved the central location of the hotel. Everything was within walking distance  (train station, restaurants, shops,  etc.) The rooms were not fancy or big, but adequate for amount of time we spent in them. Price was great. Will definitely return.",positive
"Car park could have been more secure,

Helpful staff with a booking at short notice",positive
"The whole experience was amazing from start to finish. I could not fault any part of my stay. Highly, highly recommended.",positive
"Would be nice if there was a proper grocery with fresh produce in the block. ,

While it’s hidden a bit among some boring city architecture and not by any measure in the middle of anything, it’s pretty conveniently located - easy walking to main train stations, public transit, shopping and food, parks and playgrounds. Breakfast is respectable. Food for purchase in the lobby is reasonable.",positive
"No volume on the tvNot enough pillows Coffee machine is not workedNot 1 extra cover or pillow, and the heating wasn’t working in the bathroom!!!When we asked something...they nicely answered...and NO help On the excuse because of the weekend:(,

"The kettle and other kitchen items were not very cleaned and I had to wash them prior using them.,

The location and staff were perfect",positive
"I would have liked a room with a view but our family room did not have that as we were in the eaves,

The location on the canal and distance to the squares and sights of Bruges was great, as was the ability to park easily close by. We also liked the architecture of the building and the lovely breakfast and the room where we took it. The staff here were very kind and friendly. Our room was also very spacious and well appointed.",positive

Good location, comfy room with enough facilities.",positive
"Apartment on the 3rd floor , no lift..",positive
"I liked everything about this property and there was nothing that I did not like.  I had an issue with the internet but after calling the operator someone came to my room in less than 3 minutes to resolve the issue.,

Great property that offers you a break from the traditional hotel. You get a fully furnished flat in a great building and ideally located.",positive
"The price!  It is a little overpriced I feel.  If the price for the room included breakfast it would have been very good value.  I feel you are paying for the experience and the canal view on top.  We paid an extra 19 euros each (reduced advance price) for breakfast per night.,

This hotel is very rustic and the real Bruges!  Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.  Lovely garden to relax in - although could do with more parasols.  Missing a trick I feel with the garden and no evening food available.  One evening we just wanted to eat a little so we bought salad and bits from a local deli and borrowed plates from the restaurant and ate in the garden.",positive
"when i arrived i didn't find my key card.,

big appartement and well designed",positive
"Super central, very helpful staff and very comfortable bed",positive
"My room was in the front of the building right outside the station.  Therefore, the noise of the taxi drivers and trains were quite loud until 11pm/12pm.  I unfortunately did not check if the rooms had aircon which in the 40 degree heat was a mistake and also the windows only open a crack for obvious reasons, but with the noise and the heat did not make for an enjoyable experience.  However, had I been in this room during the colder months with no need for air con or the windows open, this room would have been absolutely fine.,

Great location right opposite central station and a short walk away from shop and old town.  The breakfast served it's purpose with a nice range of hot and cold food and good coffee!  The aircon in the bar was welcome in the heat!  Staff were very helpful providing me with a travel adaptor for my appliances and a hairdryer (10 Euro deposit per item).  They also provided me with a fan as the rooms have no aircon.",positive

Friendlyness of the staff. Reasonable prices  for food and drink.,positive

Excellent hotel. Great location and restaurant for dinner and breakfast. Very friendly staff. Immaculately clean. A favourite.",positive
"The tent collapsing because of all the rain,

Proximity to track",positive
"I simply don't get it that there is no person taking out the trash or changing the towels if you stay less than 7 days. When we wanted clean towels, we were helped kindly, but we had a lot of trash and it just piled up in the corner. The air conditioner switched itself off after a little while, so we woke up bathing in our own sweat...,

The employees were very helpful, patient and kind. The rooms were tidy and contained a small kitchen with a fridge and microwave. Very well equipped. So we could bring something to the hotel to eat. That was perfect. We could choose the floor we wanted to be on. The windows could be opened.",positive
"Apartment was dusty not clean
No lift, not convenient if you have kids and lots of suitcases to carry. 
There were 3 nails on the wall underneath the sink in the toilet. Extremely dangerous and may cause serious injuries  if you have smaller kids crawling and playing hide and seek. We alert the management they replied saying they would send someone to look at it but no one came during our 10 days stay. 
It was very hot in the flat. No airco, only 1 fan in the entire 2 rooms apartment
Drainage in bathroom was not functioning,  bathroom was flooding every time you take shower. ,

"No aircon and it was 35 degrees during the day and hot at night. Also it was on the third floor and no lift. There were fans in the bedrooms which helped a little ,

The location was very good. It was very clean and the bedrooms were spacious",positive
Great location for bars and restaurants. Comfortable room.,positive
"Some campers were loud after hours and weren’t respectful of others. Which was tough for the staff to control.,

Extremely well looked after by the staff and better then just camping.",positive
Bed was really comfortable and I asked for a quiet room the staff were really obliging and looked after me. I had a great sleep.,positive
"This location needs more than one fan. We understand there was no air conditioning and are used to that in Germany but one small fan was not enough. The information book that was for places to go and good to eat was for places in Brussels and not Antwerp. The instructions for working appliances and such were no help for the appliances in the apartment.  The drain in the shower was clogged so bad that the water ran out onto the bathroom floor before I even had my hair washed. I had to finish my shower in the tub. The iron worked but you couldn’t put water in it bc that whole mechanism that the water goes in was broken out and part of the shower knob was broken off too. I brought all this to their attention and they said they’d take care of it but it didn’t help our stay.,

The location was perfect and the place was very clean. Not having to carry a key and being able to use a code for the street door and for the apartment door was so nice.",negative
Perfect appartment,positive
"Nothing to complain.,

Great location. We had a very nice room with garden - perfect! The hotel is good to reach from mainstation via bus.",positive
"Obnoxious irregular beeping sound during the whole night made it rather hard to get a good sleep. The room furniture seems to be rather old and used. It seems to be mostly clean, but most furniture is covered in stains and scratches. Using the shower flooded half the bathroom. Breakfast was pretty basic and, unless included in your rate, not really worth the extra charge.,

Located right opposite of a metro station (Madou) and easily in walk distance to the city centre. My room (N°25) was pretty large. Staff was friendly.",negative
"The breakfast, not much variety expected more.",positive
"I didn't like the breakfast room .  It is an old hotel,

The location is good, in front of the train station.The breakfast is Ok",negative
Beautiful place and very quiet. My hosts were very sympathetic and forward coming. I enjoyed my stay very much and would strongly recommend the place!,positive
"There are 7 short flights of stairs, no lift, so not ideal for those with very young children or the elderly or infirm.It was not a problem for our party.,

The keys were in a lock box to which we had the code, so very easy access.",positive

"Don’t book this penthouse if you’re unable to climb a few stairs. We were all bitten by lots of mosquitoes during the night, can’t really blame the owner, but maybe fly screens in front of the windows could help. ,

Very spacious penthouse apartment, with three well-sized bedrooms. Comfortable beds, very clean and in an excellent location!",positive
"very modern internet TV but only few channels to receive,

very spacious rooms, separate bathroom and toilet, nice breakfast",positive

Very friendly and helpful staff. Superior cabin was well equipped for camping novices! Lots of food and beer on offer with choices to suit everyone.",positive
"The plugs are type c and I had no idea they would be different! The coolest part is the front desk people were able to give me an adapter. There was seriously nothing bad about this hotel!,

I loved the location! It was a few minutes from a big park and just a few more minutes from the city center. The ladies and gentlemen at the front desk were absolutely amazing and friendly! They helped me so much on my stay I can't thank them enough. Also there is a washing and drying machine on the property which is super convenient.",positive
"Flat 401 where we stayed looked quite shabby and in need of renovation which has not been done for a some time. Marks, scuffs, scratches, on the walls and ceiling, holes from old fixtures, signs of wear and tear everywhere, gray towels, discolored old sofa with the disfigured armrest - all this does not take much to repaint and refresh now and then, yet has not been done for a while. The access to the property with several long flights of stairs is not easy and friendly for people carrying small children or heavy luggage, so travel light!  Also if traveling by car to this very central location, beware of the Low Emission Zone introduced in Antwerpen in 2017, which requires special authorization for foreign cars (advance application online) - something the host never mentioned when advising on the nearest car park in the central Antwerpen.,

Very responsive host, easy Check-in which can be done any time independent of e.g. late arrival. Generally this could be a nice and comfortable flat benefitting from very central location, however its run-down condition was disappointing.",negative
"No air conditioning
An iron is not allowed in the apartment
No napkins ,

Everything else",positive
"The a/c was on the weaker side. No coffee machine in room just a kettle with instant coffee.,

The location of this hotel was very nice if you want to be away from the center and the noise. It’s in an idyllic location with two small squares nearby. There are two good breakfast spots right outside the door and a restaurant in the square which was convenient for an afternoon cappuccino or an evening cocktail. And most importantly walking distance to all main tourist attractions. But there is a bus stop right outside hotel as well. There is a nice front courtyard and some seating in back grassy area as well. Very relaxing and quiet. The room was quite large in comparison to many European lodgings",positive

The location and the modern style of rooms",positive
"nothing,

Roof top bar was a very nice bonus and great locality to Grand Place.",positive
"The road was busy and the isolation of the room did not allow us to sleep without any noise. I must say that I woke up a couple of times due to this but again no super noisy.,

The location was really nice one minute walk from the train station and not far from city center. The bed was comfortable and the room very comfy and clean. Staff friendly although we didn't have any special requirement or contact with them.",positive

"The sleeping bags were a bit thin for the weather conditions, luckily we'd made provisions for this eventuality. There was no drinking water, only bottles at €3 each. Breakfast was a bit pricey. Card machine wouldn't take British cards,

The staff were truly amazing. The facilities were all in good working order and very clean. Charging facilities (batteries) were a great idea and always in stock for rotation. The layout of the camp site is very good.",positive

All round excellent",positive
"A suggestion for next year, is to have at least a shuttle service to and from the bottom of the road, especially with people having so much luggage and rainy weather. Better info boards as to the location of the site. ,

It was the perfect location to watch the F1 racing. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly.",positive

checked in early, 9:00 a.m. -  Charlotte was able to get into our room upon check in - staff attended to our needs - at restaurant we only wanted coffee....it was brought to our table and upon paying were told no charge, as an accommodation - I have traveled domestically and internationally for many years and NEVER been comped in a hotel restaurant  -",positive

"Booked apartment for 4 people but the sofa bed was not made and no bedding was left so couldn't even make the bed myself. Was a mad panic to try and get hold of the apartment so all of us could sleep.
There were no trays in the dishwasher so couldn't use it to start with.
There were no curtains in the main living area so no privacy and the sunrise woke those sleeping on the sofa bed up.
Balcony light was missing with bare wires floating on the wall.,

Great location, clean, modern, up to date.",positive

The barrier in the park opened when we took the ticket and closed when we moved behind us, but the gate didn’t open so we were trapped between the barrier and the gate for about half an hour since everyone had left the parking building and we couldn’t reach anyone.,

Very centrally located, just opposite the central station.",positive
"The place is huge and really nice. A lot of light and 3 big bedrooms. The apartment is placed at the end of a street full of bars and restaurants and is walking distance (10min) to the main markets.
The place is comfy and really really clean!",positive
"Nothing.,

A clean comfortable hotel, a walking distance from the city center and also the former railway station, nowadays the bus station, but located in a very quiet street. Good breakfast.",positive
"A minor complaint in that the toilet doors would slam shut very loudly either by people leaving them or by being caught by the wind which meant it disturbed sleep at times, enough to startle and make you jump. But this is the only real complaint I have from my entire weekend stay.,

Fantastic, friendly staff. Close to the track, only a 20 minute walk. Excellent food.",positive
"Very good location, very helpful staff and welcoming snacks were perfect :)",positive
"The 5th bed (the sofa) was terrible and there was no curtain in one of the bedrooms. There is no lift too and we need to take all the luggage upstairs until the 3th floor, where there is a cargo lift up to the 5th floor. Tiresome.
The left rooms has a lamp broken too.,

The location is good, the room is beautiful and it have a perfect spot to take photographs of the sunset.",positive
"Nothing.,

Very little English spoken by front desk staff but apart from that, apartment was spacious, in a great location. Very easy to get in and out of.",positive
"No lift to the top, but wife managed the few stairs.,

The room size was great.",positive
"Location was little far from center. Also since no reception no one to guide you if you are arriving for 1st the in a new place.,

For similar rate you can get something closer to Gran place. This property though good is quiet a distance from the center.",negative
"The walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors like they were sitting in our room. The AC ran all night and never cooled the room. If we opened the window to let in cool air all you could hear was the street below. ,

The location was perfect. Walking only a couple blocks to both the train station and the Grand Place.",positive

Location and staff",positive
"Nothing,

The location is about 20 minutes walk from the main centre through a lovely park.
Little cafe in the foyer with a pizza oven selling sandwiches, snacks and pizza.
They let us store our bags all day when leaving.",positive
"The fact that access was via steps and the lift from the 3 floor to the 5 floor for bags was not working.
There was no indication of this on arrival,
During the stay I was notified that lift repair personnel will need access in the daytime but they did not arrive",negative
"I would definitely choose it for longer stays, where I could profit of the swimming pool and gym room. It is unclear if it is possible,

Located in one of my favourite part of Brussels, close to metro station, shopping mall and magic Forêt de Soignes.The flat is spacious, kitchen well equipped and with a comfy bed.The staff is very service oriented.",positive
It was really good. Staff was amazing. Location was great,positive
"Building and bathroom in particular could use some repair and renovation.,

Location was great. Bed was comfortable and it was handy to have on site private parking even if it was 15euro per day.",negative
Amazing location and friendly staff,positive
"Bed internet,

Rude personel (men)",negative
"Nothing much,

Room was spacious and comfortable. Shower was great. Bed was comfy and the hotel perfectly positioned for sightseeing restaurants and easy parking",positive
"There was quite a lot of road traffic from Rue Bailliard. Next time I will ask for a quieter room.Additional clothes for washing and drying dishes would have been useful. Perhaps I should have asked!,

Good location for walking to meetings and for shops / parks at the weekend.The room was well lit with a good working space. Comfortable bed.",positive
"It is on the 4 flore with no elevator,

Nice aportment on great location",positive
"It is strange that in the rooms there are no cloths- and towelracks. One must go to the bedroom in order to hang the overcoat in the wardrobe and after washing the hands in the toilet to go to the bathroom for the towel. Where have you found so small wash basin for the toilet?,

The place is good: very quiet, not far from metro, and only 15 minutes by metro to the center. Also the rooms are big enough.",positive
"Old building so a bit creaky and might bother light sleepers during the night ,

Great location, spacious rooms and bathroom.",positive

I liked the fact the bed was comfortable and big",negative
"Rooms, smell of wet carpets or something ,

Location",positive
"Wifi didn't work at all. I stayed only one night so didn't bother trying to talk with the staff about it. Signal was good but there was no internet - its possible that it could have been fixed by the staff. The room was tiny and there was no fridge. Windows can't be fully opened - only tilted ,

Amazingly, for its tiny size, the room had all the essentials (except for a fridge), even a table with 2 chairs. Location is perfect for me - literally right across the central train station. It's a bit noisy with windows open but I am not bothered by that",positive
"The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom excellent.  The breakfast had a wide choice of food both hot and cold.Reception staff courteous and professional.  Location very good just a few minutes walk from the main square with a variety of restaurants.",positive
"Too soft mattress for my taste.,

Location, breakfast, room, everything.",positive
"dirtyness,

it ok",negative
"The location is a bit far from the city centre.,

The neighborhood was very quiet, and the size of the apartment was huge.",positive
"Perfect location, 2 minutes to main square but away from the hustle and bustle so quiet area. Reasonably priced restaurants close by.",positive
"Not reserve tower ,

The decoration was good but some things like the sofa you need the change",negative
"The closet was fairly small, not enough room to hang clothes if you are staying for few days. Only 4 hangers were available and no place to add more. There was no clock by the bedside.,

The location is very convenient. Few minutes walk to central station and within few minutes walk to the Grand Palace",positive
"No air conditioning.,

Location was great next to train station.",positive
"Great location, wonderful attentive staff, and solid accommodations.  The location is within walking distance of the main Bastogne square, monuments, and the Airborne Museum.",positive
"Traffic noise might be a problem in some rooms, but this not something that the hotel can do anything about,

Location is excellent for a business trip and especially if you are working with EU institutions.  If as a tourist, it is not such a long walk to the main sights such as Grand Place",positive
"A little noise with the neighbors but after having contacted the reception, the neighbors stopped.",positive
"Absolutely nothing, please continue working as you do,

The 'accueil' was perfect, friendly and professional. The premises are very convenient, close to public transport, impeccably clean. The staff is very friendly and professional, redy to assist you whenever you need.",positive
"Two single beds pushed together. Half size pillows.,

Location, views and staff",positive
"We stayed over the weekend, so no staff were present (this we knew in advance so isn't a criticism).  However, things like the coffee machine only had two coffee pods for two people for two nights - there are no refills available, and no one at reception to speak to for example about this.  Also, the kettle, coffee machine, microwave, and lamp all shared one plug which doesn't seem safe or sensible.  Again, small issues but easily avoidable and not an expensive cost.,

Efficient service, and large spacious room.  Check-in procedure was well arranged and easy to follow the instructions. Central location, but not too crowded or busy, and only about 15 minutes walk to the centre.  A fair number of bars, restaurants, cafes located very close within walking distance.",positive
"I guess the one thing I would say was that the dining area for breakfast is a little small for the size hotel. Had to maneuver around individuals with their plates, and chairs were bumped whenever you had to get up from your table.,

Very professional, helpful and pleasant staff, from check in on August 12th to check out on the 14th. They made me feel at home and not a bother whenever I had questions, and I had a few. Definitely will stay here again on my next trip to Brussels...A+ Service",positive
"nothing to complain about,

Only spending 1 night in city and passing through in morning , so location outside the train station is perfect",positive

"Nothing,

Great staff, great location, room exactly as pics on internet. Breakfast excellent, would definitely recommend.",positive
"Very difficult to locate by satnav for some reason. Breakfast was a total waste. A drinks vending machine would have been perfect for guests checking in late. Was trapped in the shower for about half an hour but didn’t really get an apology for it, lucky I had my cell phone to call for help!,

The property is in a good location with easy access to the Metro. It is clean and comfortable.",negative

the summer terrace was worth a visit in a summer with great views and live music. And bed was really comfortable",positive
"Street noise, no air con,

City location, breakfast",negative
"There was nothing I didn't like!,

Everything.  The reception, a secure place to store my bike overnight, the design of the room, the quietness at night (even with a room overlooking the street), the shower, the comfort of the bed, the splendid buffet breakfast (ideal for a cyclist) ... everything!  The staff were very courteous.  Great value for money.",positive
"Nothing,

The room is simple but very clean, quiet, at a convenient location (walking distance from Grand Place, Parliament and restaurants). Staff is very helpful and friendly. Good price for Brussels. Great wifi.",positive
Wow I was so happy when I arrived the apartment was super clean and it worth the price I enjoyed my one night stay everything was working perfectly fine,positive
"Everything was really ok. The advantage for me is that it is situated right at the end of the motorway, so that I can avoid traffic jams. It has a garage, and the Metro station is just some minutes walk away.",positive
"Hotel is a lovely older style hotel but updated/tastefully decorated to keep with the ambience. Our standard double room was clean and spacious with huge comfortable bed, armchairs and tv. The bathroom was very large also. Hotel in quiet street but 3 minute walk to the Markt and near all attractions. Perfect and pretty location near canal. The staff were excellent and extremely helpful.",positive
"Some of the equipment in the gym did not work and there was no reception so to ask a question you need to send an email and not always efficient in answering.,

The apartment was very beautiful and the location was very central 10 minute walk from Grand Place. Supermarket close by and other cafes and restaurants",positive
"Could not work out how to switch some of the lights off,

The staff were welcoming. The room was spotless.",positive
No airconditioning,positive
location,positive
"It's not like I would not have liked something it just because in one night was a little noise cause near the location was paved a street. But not something to disturb our holidays.,

Very good location in the European District, easy to get there. Quickly check-in. The room was cozy and clean and is for the very first time when I can sleep from the first night in an unknown place.",positive
"The appartment was very dirty.
There were stains on the pillows and the linnen.
There were large brown stains on the carpet.
The appartment had a strong smell of cigarettes and liquor.
I didn't want to stay anymore but had no other choice.",negative

"Nothing !! ,

Lovely hotel in beautiful city !
Staff very helpful. Room clean and very comfortable. Private garden area very nice. Good breakfast with the nice touch of Prosecco!",positive
The room was spacious and well appointed. I especially liked having a kettle!,positive
"The bed was, without a doubt, the worst bed we've ever slept on in a 4 or 5 Star hotel.  The mattress was harder than the floor, and it had a mattress protector on top of it which felt like it was made from coir matting!  God knows what they put in it.  After the first night of getting almost no sleep we took the protector off and then at least we only had to sleep on the solid mattress.  We were so happy to get home to our own bed.Another gripe - mostly because we're both tall - is that the shower is a rainfall one, fixed to the ceiling, at a height of about 5'8"""" from the bath floor, and has no directional movement. So if you want a shower you have to squat slightly if you want your head to get wet.,

Location is fantastic - just a couple of minutes walk round the corner and you're in the Grand Place.  Just a couple of minutes walk the other way and you're at Brussels Central railway station.",positive
"It was terrible hot in the hotel No Air Conditioner. You cannot open the window. I had problems with Internet and have to go to a cafeteria at the Railway Station to use the WiFi there. In the bathroom there was no one shelf, no one hook to carry the towel.,

Location is perfect!  5 min walk from the railway station. Touristic bus stop on the square near the railway station Many shops in the area. At about 10 min walk from the hotel is the excellent Argentinian bistro where we had dinner every day.",negative
"No airco in room. Windows could not be fully open in our room. They offered us another room with balcony so we slept very well.,

Staff, girl at night did her best to help us.",positive
"Great hotel, fantastic, friendly and helpful staff! Breakfast was also really nice. I will come back for sure.",positive
"The room was on a 5th floor without an elevator. 110 steps to climb on a steep staircase. This should have been clearly announced.Completely unacceptable for people with reduced mobility of not so good physical condition.Wifi was missing. Basic amenities. Not very clean. Pillows unconfortable. Scarcity of towels.Fire scape ladder, a real practical joke! If somebody needs to use it, it will be a big risk. Accesible only for acrobats!,

The location is centric",negative
"A little bit far away from downtown and very limited breakfast,

Excellent and very large room in a quiet location.",positive
"Spacious, comfortable room with everything we needed in a convenient location to Bruges' attractions. Great breakfast and friendly staff",positive
"The bed is like a trampoline, so difficult to sleep with someone else in one and the same bed. Please change the mattress. It is not comfortable at all. 
The toilet's door is transparent. No privacy when you use it.,

Big flat, nice kitchen and quiet during the night",negative
"Bit old Decor could be upgraded,

Location to train station",positive
"Although a good location very noisy outside from  railway station and early morning revellers!,

Good central location across from railway station",positive

The family room for 4 was spacious.
The bar offered a great selection of local beers.
Large breakfast and excellent coffee.
Friendly and helpful staff.",positive

It was sufficient and location is great, closed to everything..",positive
"The apartment has not got knives folks, place was very dirty given the circumstances that it is a pandemic.  There were instances that not got cleaning disinfectant sprays etc. Kettle were very dirty. Towels was very tough ragged old towels not enough towels for 3 adults. Sofa beds didn't have bed covers sheets, nothing ! Not got spare clean sheets.  Place was very noisy when you open the front door they were not hot air conditioning or fans. ,

I would like them to refund our money 💰 vety poor services.  2nd apartment was on over 10 flights of starecase , then place toilet one only hasn't cleaned gor like 6 months , sewage smells every where, toilet wasn't flushed for months with excret on it.  Bath was not working after I cleaned it. Again sofa bed no sherts nothing   no floor mats bath mats.",negative
"English or Vlaams was limited to individual personnel.,

Had a problem with the dishwasher, but it was dealt with as quickly as possible, given that it was the weekend. Staff very friendly but a fluent knowledge of french from any future visitors would be useful!",positive
"N/A,

We were delayed arriving until the small hours, and the staff stayed up to greet us and checked us in quickly so we could get to bed. That was great service.",positive
"Very clean and modern. 
Easy check-in system. 
Good location",positive
"Fantastic location seconds from Grand Place.  A little dated & olde worlde but very comfortable with charming, helpful staff & excellent breakfast buffet.,

Location. Staff. Roof terrace. Beds",positive
"The interior of the premises appeared dated but other than that, no real faults identified.,

The hotel was centrally located right next to Antwerp Central train station, probably 100m away, which was a huge bonus especially if carrying around lots of luggage as we were (no need for a taxi).We only stayed one evening but found the room was clean and tidy, the bed was comfy and the place offered good value for money",positive
"Clean, good location, good parking",positive
"There is no hotel car park. But plenty of street parking available and can pay for a ticket for 24 hours.,

Relatively spacious apart hotel for 3-4 people. Separate kitchenette with table chairs, fridge, microwave and 2 cooking plates. Beds were comfortable, hotel quiet.
Near to a bus 95 direct to a Grand Place in 10-15 minutes. Also 5 minutes walk to Trône metro and a supermarket.",positive
Not a good service,negative
Not enough information for tourists. But generally excellent,positive
Ilike the hotel it was nice.i stay for 1 day but its worthit. For sure i will be back again amd ican recommend it to other travellers.Ilike the hotel securities as even though there is no receptionist still its safe as no one from outsider can enter the hotel as the lift requires the hotel key to enter.,positive
"Nothing ,

So close to the city centre and such a good hotel!",positive
"Good location, close to station, about a 20 minute walk to Groenplaats. Loads of rooms so as we were a party of 16, we could all stay at the same place. It was pretty much as expected from other reviews, no frills, OK price. Not great, not awful. Good for a lads weekend away, not the kind of place you would take your partner for a romantic weekend!I loved the city of Antwerp, far better than anticipated, would definitely visit the city again.",negative
"Not the fault of the hotel, but drunk guests knocking on our door and being very loud at 330am wasn’t appreciated. Then the same guests leaving via a bus at 6.00am again loudly and knocking on doors!,

Close to the town centre, clean comfy rooms.",positive
"Cleaning service for extra charge,

Nice apartment, clean rooms, comfortable, quiet. Friendly staff.Great location (15 minutes to Central station and Grand Place via park). Small kitchen in the room, it's very comfortable.",positive
"kleenex tissues and cotton pads would be useful in the bathroom,

Very spacious, spotlessly clean apartment with balcony (handy for smokers): TV, furnished kitchen (microwave, filter-coffee machine with courtesy teas and biscuits, courtesy mineral water, fridge, dishwasher, ). Hairdryer, bathrobe and slippers provided. Sleeping very comfy, good mattress and pillows, silence.I would definitely choose it for longer stays, where I could profit of the swimming pool and gym room.Convenient also for reaching the European Quarter, 5 minutes walk from Metro Herrmann Debroux, which gets you to Schuman in 15'.If you arrive after 20h00, you need to call the night guardian at 02 6740917 who will open the door and give you the keys to your apartment.My rate was € 89 for one night (single occupier, without breakfast) so very good value for money.Very quiet building in a quiet, safe area.",positive
Good next to center,positive
"The property was at the best location , within minutes to the station and the grand place . We arrived at 11 am , with the check in time at 3 pm and the hotel immediately gave us a room ! We did not even expect that and were very thankful after a long journey ! Staff were very helpful . Excellent location . Would definitely recommend.",positive
They gave out my booked room to someone else.,negative
"Close to lots of restaurants in 5 minute walk. Excellent food for breakfast, staff superb.
Highly recommended",positive
The customer service is excellent very kind and helpful information,positive
"The cleanliness could improve. There was a LOT of dust in the bedside tables. The bathroom had a huge patch of humidity that they could take care of. Finally, I would have expected them to refill the tea/coffee facilities.,

There is no reception. Always available but they send you an email with the details to enter the building, get the room of the apartment... Also the apartment is very spatious.",negative

"1. The room needing a lot of maintenance.- The air conditioner in the bedroom, even when it was closed completely, it was giving noise like drilling every 15-30 minuets, day and night. Sleeping with it and waking up with a headache!- The room wasn't cleaned well, lot of dirty.- The air conditioner in the sitting room, wasn't working well, can't control the speed.- The bathroom door having problems, giving extreme noise.- The window in the bedroom was broken.- The tawels very bad and old, having a lot of holes.2. When i informed the manager, he said we can not fix them now, and we can't move you to another room because we are full booked.3. When i asked cancellation, they said we can not do anything to you, go cancel from booking.com but we remind you that your reservation non-refundable. 4. After they took the money they turned their backs, they didn't be helpful at all.It was very bad experience with the B Aparthotel.,

The location.",negative
Close to the grand place.,positive
"The shower curtain; sticky, challenge to keep the floor dry. ,

Good location, supermarket and other shops close by.",positive
"Secret rooftop bar was very expensive and not worth it at all - the drinks were rubbish.  The view was nice though,The woman in the next room was very happy with the place, so happy she made very loud happy sounds on several occasions.  The walls were not very soundproof.,

Location was perfect, it was clean and efficient and just what was needed.  A typical, nice city hotel, did everything it needed to.",positive

Excellent location and very friendly staff who helped us with some print outs. Breakfast was good. Overall excellent value for money!",positive
"The circumstance of this stay is a bit particular. It was in the midst of the corona-crisis and there wasn't (m)any guests at the hotel. Yet, most of my necessities were met. The breakfast was basic, the reception was doing most in their power to accommodate me. It was a bit pity that I had to stay outside in the cold after the checkout time for 3 hours in waiting for my next move because the reception and lobby had to close due to no booking in the day, but that's fair.",positive
"No AC but that was fine because wasn’t that hot ,

Very good value for money and helping staff",negative
"The shower overflows easily, one needs to be careful. In summer it would be difficult to make the place dark enough to sleep.,

The loft decoration offered a great atmosphere, the place was very well equipped and Isa had added even some extras for our little one, which he appreciated very much. As dog lovers we also enjoyed, even from far, the boxers of Isa.",positive
Value for money! Definitely deserves a come back,positive
"Really unusual residence, had a great trip, great host",positive
"Staff was very kind, helpful and friendly. Beach is 50 meter away. View is nice from the restaurant",negative

This place is amazing! Very spacious and comfortable. Very very friendly owners with the cutest little dog ever. We travel a lot and have not yet come across a place as amazing as this one!! If you need to be in Knokke or Bruges try to stay here!!! Breakfast is also superb.,positive
"No electric cattle in the room. The hotel decided to close as from 1 April and I had to change the hotel. They found however another available hotel for 1 night for me and gave back the money for the last day.,

"New, clean, spacious self-contained apartment, with everything you could want or need. Very nice owners. Excellent",positive
"Breakfast rather unimaginative, but for an alternative there are many cafes within easy distance. Tea/coffee facilities in the rooms would be a welcome extra.,

Good location; easy to find; near a Metro station with easy access to Brusells Midi; easy walking distance from Gare Centrale. A pleasant old building with quiet rooms.",positive
"Some of the rooms are effected by outside noise,

Good Selection of cooked items and cold cuts",positive
Great location.,positive
Maybe the noise of the neighbours but it's normal for the location. An idea is to separate the toilet from the sleeping room. Otherwise a very good appartment,positive
"Everything was faultless,

Everything!  The breakfast was delicious and fresh. Accommodation extremely comfortable and tastefully decorated.  Our hosts were friendly, accommodating and very helpful.  Do not miss staying here if you are in Bruges",positive
There was a strong smell of sigarette in the room and the heating was too warm.,negative
What a gem in the old city!  Easy walking distance to all of the downtown.  Great blend of old-world charm with the right amount of modern conveniences.  The window view of the canals behind the hotel was amazing!,positive
"The rooms were ok - but they are really basic and the outfitting shows it age. Again, this is not a problem in summer when you're outdoors anyway.,

The location of this hotel is perfect. You simply cannot get closer to the beach and the promenade of De Haan, as you are right on it. The rooms are ok but not great and the windows could do with some double insulation (although this of no concern in summer obvilously). The hospitality was good and breakfast was fine. Because of the current Covid measures it is impossible to rate the quality of the restaurant. However, if open the view from it would very good.",negative
"We really like the style in the room and very functional.It’s close to the main shopping street and there is a supermarket cross street.The only thing need to take care is apartment have narrow stairs ,so don’t bring your big or heavy size luggages here~",positive

"Breakfast expensive considering food was cold and waiting for fresh supply when food had run out. This was our 3rd stay here, but will be the last. And why did they put a plastic chair in the bedroom when it is an old hotel or period building. ,

Location great. Staff on from desk helpful..",positive
"What a great place. Thank you, Eva and Mady! I can't say enough good things so I'll start with huge praise for their excellent communication. In addition to originally being schedule to arrive at a terribly inconvenient hour, I eventually had a last-minute travel situation occur that changed my arrival even more dramatically. As I understand it the hosts are normally on sight in their shop below but were off for the winter before the Christmas market opened. Even though we were not able to meet me in person, they were very accommodating and communicated with me exceptionally well. As for the apartment itself it begins on the 3rd floor (with ground as 1st) and occupies the 3rd, 4th and 5th floors above a gelato shop overlooking Brado, City Hall and the famed Guild Houses. The rooms were all very comfortable and modern, and the entire place was immaculately clean. The kitchen was very well stocked with cooking supplies should you want to ignore all the wonderful restaurants just steps away. I enjoyed my coffee in the morning at the breakfast counter facing the beautiful old Antwerp Guild Houses, which during my visit were glowing with Christmas lights. My kids were all fondest of the very top floor with a lovely loft space, high vaulted ceiling, amazing view onto the plaza, very large sofa and tv. The photos I've attached show the view from the windows looking onto the Grote Markt as the city is setting up for the Christmas market. You couldn't ask for a better location in all of Antwerp!I am sincerely looking forward to another stay here again in the future.",positive

"Hands down the best B&B we have stayed at for many years. We had our own floor of the house which consisted of a large living room including dining area, a very spacious double bedroom and bathroom. Our room was extremely comfortable, clean and very modern. The breakfast was amazing and hand delivered to our room at a time we chose so we could eat in the comfort of our supplied dressing gown and slippers. As we was 10 minutes drive to Bruge, we were happy to get a taxi in however the lovely owners offered to drop us off and even pick us up if we were to give them a ring. (Which we die) Enroute to Bruge he even gave us a scenic tour of the local area which was very interesting. 
Overall the actual room and especially the service given by the owners will keep us coming back time and time again. 
Thank you and see you soon",positive

Perfect location - right on the seafront and next to plenty of restaurants, cafés, etc. A peaceful and pleasant place to stay.",negative
"Access & stairs to property were under renovation & was a shock to us we didn’t expect anything like it. My partner was in tears when we opened the door. However once we got into the apartment it was fine. It would have been better if we had some advanced warning re the condition of the access.,

Location & self contained.",negative
Never had such good service and the breakfast was delicious!,positive
"It was a walk from and to the central train station. It may take some people 15 minutes but someone who never been there it’s more then 15 min. It’s also quite a bit of a walk to the central plaza. Dragging my luggage on the cobble stone sidewalk was not easy.,

The room I had was cozy and just right for me. It’s simple and clean.",positive

The staff were extremely friendly and professional. They also remembered it was our anniversary and upgraded us to an amazing room! The room and the facilities were fantastic!,positive
"Difficult to find the hotel as it cannot be reached by car. Park your car on the big parking lot for free, and walk to the hotel.No reception, receive your room key at the bar. Room could be cleanerWe tried the restaurant but we were not impressed.,

Small hotel/restaurant at the beach. We had the luck that our room had sea-view, Excellent location, excellent value for money! Older hotel, facilities were average. Staff was friendly.Good breakfast buffet.",positive

"Staying in this apartment again was fantastic. The location does not get better in De Haan, and in this apartment, you even get a 270 degree breathtaking view of the beach and sea. The apartment is beautifully decorated in modern, clean design and is at the same time cosy and comfortable. Enjoying the sun on the tiny balcony while looking at the sea just felt like holiday. It was difficult to leave, and I will definitely be back again!",positive
"The master switch takes some getting used to, we had to leave lights on downstairs during the night in order for others to work. Shower temperature is very unpredictable, one minute ok, next minute scalding hot then freezing. ,

Location is brilliant and great price for city centre. Apartment is huge compared to what you would get a hotel room for same price.",positive

Everyrhing was good. We enjoyed very much our stay.",positive
"This is not the fault of the hotel, but you get the impression in the booking.com that there is a roof top bar for the hotel guests which is the reason why we booked the Warwick. We were disappointed to find out that this was only available as an exclusive booking only arrangement.,

Nice friendly welcome and a pleasant surprise when the hotel upgraded our room to a suite as it was my mother's 70th birthday and left a small gift in our room.",positive
"In our room it was a little bit to warm.,

Nice location with a very nice stuff. Breakfast was good und you have a beautiful view to the beach while eating.",negative

Good price. Nice hotel..,positive

The Location was very good the breakfast was very good",positive

"Amazing apartment with panaromic view in top location in De Haan. Extremely pleasant, modern decor, spotlessly clean and all the facilities you need. The view is the best possible entertainment, only topped by a run or walk on the beach! Parking free and super easy in the tiny street. Good and friendly shops nearby. Would definitely stay there again.",positive
"Some things had not been cleaned, eg. On top of things and behind things. Generally the floor and beds were clean but the place needs a deep clean.,

Easy self check in process and directions to very well priced car park €3.80 for 24hrs and only 10mins walk from the apartment. Very cool and trendy apartment that has been decorated to a high quality. Strange taste but nice to explore",positive
"The breakfast was poor because there weren't enough tables, and there was a 10-15 minute wait to get in, and then the people were left to deal with it themselves.We were waiting for 20 min for fresh bread. The butter ran out and didn't get replaced. We also had to make our own bed, why?,

The room and bathroom were clean.",negative
"The fact that I was not able to connect to the Wifi.. but I was using my mobile internet then during the stay. IF I would ask they would probably help.,

The rooms are very clean, the staff is kind and ready to help, there is reception open 24h a day. They have a small kitchen in every room - with coffee machine and the water heater and in the lounge there is also a small store where you can buy some food to prepare then in the room.",positive

The location is very good, right on the sea side, good breakfast with a view.",negative
"The room was quite cold when I checked in because the heating was off. Separate bathroom (I had to leave my room, cross the hallway and use my hotel card to enter). That was specific to this particular room though (408). The view from my room was very poor.,

Great breakfast offered from 6.30am to 9.30am. Friendly staff, reliable WiFi and clean rooms. Good shower with shampoo dispenser (same for handsoap). Within walking distance from the central station and shopping mile.",positive
"Stairs going to the room.  About the only negative.,

Meals were outside hotel. Wanted to experience local cuisine.",positive
"We absolutely loved our stay. But if I sit and wonder why, I would say it's because of the owners, who were very welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was excellent. Also, good position, close to centre and literally 2 minutes of walking of the coast tram station.  A nice touch is the coffee machine and the capsules in the room.",positive

Good location, friendly staff.Comfortable rooms and well maintained.Really nice pub/ bar restaurant attached to hotel in the corner, very friendly waiters and good service.",positive
"lack of window and dirty bathroom,

medium level Hotel which definitely needs maintenance, we had the room at the bottom which seemed to be a veranda in the past renewed in '90th/'00th with carpet on the floor, spot lights and a nice living area with two couches and a desk but unfortunately not separated from the bed room, it was very big but also extremely warm even if outside temperature was 18 °C, likely there was a little portable air-co which supplied to the lack of windows.The toilet was big as well, two sinks, bathtub but the WC and the bathtub were dirty. Very good breakfast with sea view, we really appreciated the smoked salmon, very good!",negative
"More accessible mirrors ,

Staff so friendly and helpful",positive
"It is a beautiful property!!  Great view to the canal, excellent taste in furniture and just like a dream!",positive
"Nothing to complain at all.,

This nice place in the centre of town only opened recently and the friendly staff makes sure you feel comfortable. The sunny garden terrace is certainly an asset where you can enjoy the yummy breakfast with freshly made eggs in the morning. 
Free public parking options are just around the corner and its a 10-15min stroll to the beach side.",positive
"inner front door didn't lock very worrying although the outer one to the street did but not very secure, access to the apartment through a crowded restaurant is awkward, main light switch below a socket hanging out the wall, no opening windows in bedrooms and all the sky lights being blocked off, stairs very narrow you have to walk side ways to get down them safely, toilet seat broken, several bulbs not working, annoying fan from restaurant going on and off all night, shower a bit annoying and both bathroom sinks didnt hold water as plugs leaked.,

great location,host,quirky décor.",positive
"The smell of sewers was really obnoxious.,

Location is excellent. Breakfast is decent. Good value for money.",positive
"May not charge in Euros unless you specify when booking.,

Great location, comfortable room, close to public transport and good for self catering.",positive
Breakfast not at level of product quality to be expected from this price level and international standards,positive
"There is nothing to say, except the buffet breakfast is open from 8:30 to 9:30 am, which is bit short. It would be nice to have breakfast open for about 2 hours at least as the travelers go for holidays or relaxing.,

The buffet breakfast with the view to the beach - was a fantastic view. The hotel makes their own breads-very delicious. They have 4 course menu with good price. The hotel is at the beach and very nice view from the bedroom. Very kind and friendly staff. Parking spaces are behind the hotel free of charge. De Haan and its beach promenade is very nice. Easily reachable to small shops and bakeries. This hotel needs 3 stars! This place is also good for weekends, short and long holidays!  We recommend to try this hotel. We will come back again. Thank you very much!",positive

Great location.
Very professional and lovely staff",positive

The staff went above and beyond accommodating our belated arrival due to unforeseen circumstances. Very friendly and caring about the comfort of their customers.",positive
"we asked for a late check out with the owner and he said it was all okay, but the cleaning lady wasn't really happy with this. She was a little bit pushy to get us out and said she couldn't really do anything will we were still there so in the end we last earlier. otherwise is the loft a perfect place to stay! thank you,

beautiful loft, really cosy and in a really good location. the loft has everything you can ask for!Lots of nice restaurants and cafes! highly recommended",positive

The location was superb as I had a number of train journeys.",positive

Excellent place! I would recommend it to everyone for a business trip to Brussels. Very central location, spacious and well equipped rooms.",positive
"The shower was leaking.
Rooms have poor soundproof the noise from the corridor and other rooms are annoying you will feel it especially in weekend when the rooms are full. ,

Super Location in the heart of centre",positive
"hotel say we don't take american express, I've call American Express and Amex say me the accept the credit card. Not professionnal.,

the situation, breakfast is very good.",positive
"There are multiple buildings for the property. The one we stayed in didn't have an elevator and we were on the top floor. That's good for some exercise, but if you've had a long day of walking and touring, it can get tiring. Also, bathrooms were nice and clean but shower itself was kind of small making it hard to ""maneuver"".,

Great location. We practically walked everyday from the hotel to the historic district, helping us save on transport costs. The rooms were simple, modern and clean. Staff were friendly and polite and spoke good English.",positive
"Garden has so much more potential, and cigarette butts on the lawn not a good look,

Ground floor and successfully got the room next door to my daughters.  Thank you",positive

Location. Staff were very pleasant. The bed was very comfy",positive

Excellent location.",positive

"It might get noisy if there is anything going on downstairs as the walls are thin. But usually just over weekend :),

The loft is great! Brilliant view to the museum. The place was cleaned well, bed linen prepared. Will definitely come back later!",positive
"Mattresses are a bit thin.,

This was an ideal location across the street from Antwerp Central train station so getting around is very easy. The staff was friendly. The only downfall was that the mattresses are a bit thin but the price for the length of my stay was very good. The location itself is close to many restaurants and shops so there's a lot to do there!",positive
"Internet, although was high speed still was of low quality with it dropping out regularly. The room itself was very nice, but the smallest TV on the wall, didn't make sense...
Kitchenette needs more utensils and pans.,

Spacious, modern room with everything you need for a short term stay. The kitchenette is only basically equipped so not for more than a two week stay.",positive
"I wasn't there for long enough to give a fair criticism - positive points are usually much easier to identify quickly, unless something is appreciably wrong.  What I can say, is that in my short stay I found nothing which struck me as inappropriate or needing correction.,

Breakfast not taken (no time, but in any case the price was somewhat disconcerting).  Location was excellent, and the layout, the arrangement of the hotel was apt for the location.  Also, on every contact the staff were without exception friendly, courteous and helpful.",positive
"De Haan beach area is really nice. Perfect location of the Hotel! Right on the beach. Parking in De Haan is free.The Hotel is not new nor fancy, it rather could get a little makeover, BUT it was clean, the location awesome, the staff very friendly and the breakfast buffet was really good and more then enough to eat.",positive
"We booked a 4-bed room. The room was spacious but the interior was simple. I miss a bit of warm atmosphere.,

The staff was very friendly, very reactive and helpful despite my late booking for that evening. The location is good, in a neighborhood which is quiet in the evening, but close to the center.",negative
"The Hotel is getting a little in need of redecoration. having said that it does have a sort of aged charm about it,

Very good service, helpful staff and comfortable large room",positive
"If there is a curtain in the bedroom roof window, may better.  Kettle need to refresh,

Room is big to feature a family with four.  Interesting decor.  Overall it’s value for the price",negative
"Didn't like the neighborhood but the hotel can't help that,

A fine hotel for one or two nights. Only spent the night there so I couldn't tell something about the restaurant, but the rooms were clean and tidy. Nice showers. Close to the center.",positive
"The kettle in my room was broken, and there was no electrical socket in the kitchenette.,

The room was nice and warm!",positive
"Breakfast was very average and food in the restaurant was unimaginative.,

Location was excellent,  very convenient to attractions. Bed was clean and comfy.  Staff were very good.",positive
"No parking on site, despite of that being advertised on booking.com. It's not a big deal, since there's free parking in town. But we went there in March. Finding a free parking spot in High summer season might be more complicated.,

Really good breakfast, and excellent views from our room. The restaurant at the hotel was also very good. The staff was very friendly as well. Fairly clean room as well. Overall the value for money is good.",positive
"A couple of small things:1. The water pressure in the shower is a bit weak2. The breakfast could be improved3. They don't offer complimentary coffee or tea for the guests, you have to pay for it,

It's a nice hotel in a very good location of Brussels. The room was spacey enough, clean and nice.The Wifi worked flawlessly and the staff were nice, friendly and helpful.",negative
"Staff very helpfulBreakfast was lovelyGood location to the centre",positive
"It was a little bit louder at night time but that what u have to expect in an area like this.,

It was amazing and the apartment was bigger than any apartment we ever stayed in. Only minus is noise.",positive
"We left our luggage in the luggage room until it was time to check in, no tags, no checking who took what and which.  Not secure at all...,

The hotel was just across the train station and round the corner from pubs, restaurants and shops.  The receptionists were always very helpful with providing information we required to get around Antwerp. The room was warm and the heated bathroom flooring was awesome :) Very clean rooms!",positive
"Would be useful to have a safe in the room, and the room is a little expensive but OK,

Almost everything, just a couple of small points - see below",positive

"We had requested a 5th bed for a child/young adult and only found a cot. We had to make up a bed on floor from cushions.
There was no hot water, no soap.
The noise from the restaurant below and bar/club next door was loud and prevented sleep,

Great look and feel",negative
"I was attacked by spiders on the first night and had to go to hospital in Antwerp the following afternoon. When I informed the staff and requested to change rooms, they didn’t really care about my well being and just told me they changed the sheets, refusing my request of a different room. I didn’t feel like a very valued customer in that case but you get what you pay for I suppose. ,

Convenient location, adequate facilities and was good value for money.",positive
"Breakfast area is often crowded and noisy since it is close to entrance and no separation from lobby.,

Very cosy, nice having a little kitchenette, mattresses excellent , cleaning also great. staff very helpful and very nice",positive
"The view of the room is not good. I cannot see anything but a tall building with solid walls just in front of the room. There is no power plugs besides the bed so it it not easy to charge my cell phone and laptop if i want to use on the bed.,

The hotel is at a very good location, very close to the city land marks but is also very quiet. The staff at the reception is very kind and willing to help all the time. The room is clean with convenient facilities.",positive
The kind of shower + the pressure of water,positive
Hotel normal pero céntrico,positive
"Parking was a little distance away and was 22 Euro per night which was a little expensive. Otherwise. excellent,

Location was brilliant. Nice Hotel with pleasant staff",positive
"The shower was a little unpredictable and it was hard to get the balance of hot and cold water right, with the cold water cancelling out the hot water sometimes. This is only a minor problem though.,

The keys were held in a key code box upon arrival, which was pretty cool and convenient. It meant there was no specific time we had to check in and we could let ourselves in straight away. I loved that! The whole apartment is very, very spacious but still cosy. It's easily the best place I've ever stayed in and we will 100% both be going back next year as we didn't stay in Antwerp long enough. Honestly can't recommend this place enough. Its location is beautiful too, being close to the docks and a number of restaurants.",positive

Very helpful and friendly staff",positive
"(Unfortunately the Oven/Grill didn't work and there was no toaster), This affected breakfast as there was no way to prepare toast (but this was not a big issue),

Spacious and a fantastic location - Overlooking the MAS and it was wonderfully warm and spacious with excellent 'open' wi-fi from the adjoining restaurant 'Napos', the key collection was easy and painless and I can recommend this Apartment for value location and space (2 Bedrooms * 2 shower rooms)",positive
"Bed was not top. WIFI was not working in my room. I had to move to the door to receive connection. Working table was to small.,

Location was OK.",positive
"1st time in this place and very positively surprised. Good offers on food and refreshments in the lobby, very friendly service. Location close to Parlament, quiet room and very affordable in comparison.",positive
"Good location close to Grand Place. We prefer smaller hotels, but this was just fine for our purposes. An easy 5-minute walk to the train station.",positive
"Uncomfy, really warm in the room (no AC) and loud outside when window open. Breakfast only served from 8.30 to 9.30AM. Rooms definitely need to be updated (everything from the beds and pillows to the carpets etc...),

Location is amazing. Price is OK with breakfast included.",negative

"Lovely staff, spacious rooms, comfy beds, clean, good sized fridge!",positive
"Rooms were basic and a little tired. Bathroom was of poor quality and shower was over the bath style, cramped and not too reliable.
Breakfast was below average nothing to complain about but for cost I felt it lacked quality and choice
I thought it being Belgium that waffles would be an option but sadly no.,

Location was excellent and staff friendly",positive
"Parking a little far (10mins walk) ,

Good location and picturesque inside, very fresh staff and great selection for breakfast although we didn’t eat in the evening here. 
Rooms very clean and good size!",positive
"Smells,

Place, people, adventure",negative
"I think it may be a little overpriced. 10€ for the breakfast provided was a bit steep. For a two star hotel, 130€ is a bit overpriced. But I understand Belgium is an expensive place so I understand. I would still stay there if I got to come back.,

I especially liked the staff! I would say they were the highlight of the stay.",positive

"Very nice host, apartment looks better than on pictures. Hosts provided all the necessary basic kitchen and bathroom stuff.",positive
"Bit noisy early morning,

Where it is",positive
"The apartment could be more clean. We observed several undefined stains on walls and bed linen. Bed linen were washed but some stains persisted.We found 2 cooking pots and 2 pans. The bigger cooking pot seemed inappropriate to cook and it would be convenient to have 2 correct cooking pots. Otherwise, the kitchen is sufficiently well equipped to cook for several days.Free wifi didn't work 3-4 first days, but host improved the situation afterwards. Guest who need good wifi for work (video call etc) should carefully consider their choice.2 chairs of table were unstable because screws were missing. And be careful if you like to open the window.In the morning, you hear easily in this apartment cars driving on the near high-traffic road Rue de la Loi.,

The location is very close to subway station Maelbeek and close to park Léopold and place Jourdan where several restaurants are located (Ramen, french fries/fritûre, ...). The host responds quickly by booking messages but he did not respond by phone (tried 1x). The access to the apartment was very easy and convenient.",negative
"Basic hotel.No refrig.No kettle.No aircon.I slept very well here because I stay in October and at high floor.If you stay here in summer and at lower floor,everything may be opposite to my stay!,

Best location.Just in front of the train station with so many resturant around.Metro station is also only150 meters walk.Good price.Comfort bed.",positive
It is great that they have the little shop on the ground floor where you can buy quick snacks and drinks!,positive

A very nice and charming Hotel - breakfast was fine, rooms were basic but fine. Overall, the atmosphere and building is very nice and charming as said",positive
"Rooms are a bit outdated, there are some stains on the carpet and some stains around the bathroom, to be expected from hotels this age. Not a big deal for me, especially at this price point. If the rooms are refurbished they can easily charge more money.,

I've booked a 3 person room and actually got a 4 person room. That was a nice surprise. I've stayed at this hotel before (in 2015) and my experience was the same. Spacious rooms and all the basic facilities you need.",positive

Nice apartment clean just the right size for a couple of days",negative
"I was paying a much larger amount compared to my friends, but I got equally if not smaller room. This is really disappointing considering I paid €135/night, excluding breakfast.,

The hotel is situated in the middle of field. There is one restaurant down stairs that seems to be very famous on its own.",positive
Excellent breakfast and dinner service in the room.,positive
"Cleaning charge for apartment when 1 person staying 1 night is expensive and makes price close to nearby 4 star hotels.,

Accommodation was good, but probably overkill for 1 person staying 1 night, as no time to use kitchen amenities. I went next door (hotel) for dinner which was good, inexpensive and convenient. Instructions for key collection on arrival were easy to follow. Location was perfect for my stay.",positive

"Great location, you can get to the centre and european quarter by foot, to get to more distant places you can take a subway which is 3 minutes from the hotel. Staff is very friendly and helpful, always does its best to answer your questions. The rooms were clean and were equipped with everything you need. 
I would recommend this place to everyone who intends to see Brussels.",positive

"Nothing to complain about... The breakfast was ok, rather than amazing. But really, you should stay here.,

The staff were outstanding, Warm and kind and everyone knew my name from when I checked in. Comfortable bed, great location, not much to complain about at all! Note, it was covid time, the hotel was quiet, which didn't bother me, and some of the facilities were reduced, but it was all in the interests of safety and I appreciated it. Also, the bar was a lovely spot for a pre-dinner cocktail :)",positive

Convenient location. Easy to access. Very clean and well equipped.",positive

Hospitality and breakfasts: super!",positive
"Two fairly minor annoyances... There was no mirror in the room - an inconvenient omission. The only mirror was in the bathroom, being fogged up by my partner showering! The exterior door to the garden annexe has no closer on it, so other guests frequently bang it - it was right by our bedroom and were woken at 0630. We had specifically asked for a quiet room - that wasn't it!,

The breakfast was excellent - plenty of choice. Do try the Sirop de Liege in little pots - a delicious alternative to jam.",negative

"The room was the smallest and most basic hotel room I've ever stayed in but since I just needed somewhere to put my head down for the couple nights I was okay with it. If I had intended to spend any length of time in the room I think I would have found it too claustrophobic. I didn't get the impression from the website that it would be as small as it was.,

Excellent location, friendly staff.",positive
"We actually don’t have any negative points to be honest. We just loved it!,

We loved our stay here. We travelled by car so it was very easy to reach the city of Maastricht and the outlet village in Maasmechelen as well. The hotel itself is just lovely, it’s a very unique building which we loved. The staff is just friendly and i‘d give 12 out of 10 points for them! The restaurant inside was lovely too. Our room was nice and clean, parkingspots provided.. just highly recommended, we’ll deffo come back here!",positive
Great location and great staff!,positive
"TV service doesn't work properly.I would need the original bill to cover the cost of the stay.",positive
"Everything was perfect!,

Loved our hosts, kind and caring couple who really made our stay exceptional. Our host didn't speak much English, and our French was terrible, but we got by with smiles and gestures. Breakfasts were fantastic and the hosts really care about their business. We were staying because it's so close to Spa circuit  where we were racing, and we couldn't have asked for a better place.",positive

It kept switching off itself after couple of hours and the remote control didn't work properly.There was one curtain that did not come down and there was a building on the opposite side so I had to climb on the chair to manually unroll/roll the curtain.Bathroom floor was not cleaned properly.It was a bit cold in the apartment - when I tried to turn up the heating the heaters made so much noise (which did not stop after waiting) so I had to turn it back down.,

Location was very good. The apartment was spacious and had everything I needed, including an iron and a hair dryer!",positive
"A nice country house in quite surroundings, with warm, kind and welcoming hosts. A nice continental breakfast is served at the time that you can agree in advance.  The location is perfect for the activities at the motor-racing Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, but equally for visiting the attractive little town of Spa or long walks in the nature.",positive
"This is a generale request. Please, suggest to hotel, restaurant, café abroad to add decaffeinated coffee and barley coffee for people not having the possibility to drink caffeinated beverages, and always include free-sugar foods for people having problem with sugars.,

Everything was nice.",positive

Everything",positive
"Perfect location in the middle of the historical center, the rooms are quiet and fantastic, furnished only with high end materials (the mattress is one of the best we've ever slept in): amongst all the great feature of this splendid hotel the staff stands out as its flagship, better than many famous 5 stars hotel we've been to.One of the best hotel of Belgium for a good reason: totally recommended.",positive

spacious, nice location, reasonable price.",positive

The included tea/coffee facilities along with beer and soft drinks was a welcome surprise.

Very good stiff bed.,positive
"I loved it all. ,

The property is built under a mill, why’s not to like?! 
It’s a new decor kinda place and the room layout is funky, stylish and very modern. 
I only got a glimpse of the restaurant (closed due to covid) but it looked great and would definitely be an place I would revisit if I was in the area. 
The Owner is awesome and stayed up till 22:00 awaiting our arrival LEGEND! 
All in all this place has everything and looks great for a couple nights stay and it’s very easy to find (just look for the massive mill and you’ll be fine 👍🏻)",positive

The location of the hotel is excellent.",positive
"Spacious apartment, clean, quiet, close to the European institutions.",positive
"There was no door to the bathroom. I imagine this is because the bathroom has no window or air extraction.The owners should address this by installing air extraction and a bathroom door.It's not good if you are sharing with a friend.,

Very nice breakfast with a wide selection and all very high quality.Great snacks and drinks in room.Very friendly and professional service.Good base for attending events at the Spa track.",positive

Comfortable bed, clean, quiet, great location",positive
"No possibility to have dinner in the garden because there was no staff available even it was promised before and the hotel was almost fully booked. Even for take-away dinner the garden could not be used. Take-away pizza was not baked very well and it was not cut into slices.Very little space for the bikes in the laundry room. Both days of our stay we needed to reinstall ourselves the laundry racks and trays to create place.,

The room was very well: spacious and clean. Breakfast was very good.",negative

"Very nice hotel, very nice owners! Restaurant with peefect food! Thank you so much for your hospitality!",positive
"-It is a bit of a stretch to call this an ""Aparthotel"" simply by virtue of putting a small sink and a two-ring hob at the end of what was otherwise an entirely ordinary hotel room. - The accommodation is very basic.  It was convenient for a few days; longer would have been difficult,

- The downstairs reception area was bright and cheerful. - The staff were all helpful and polite.  - The location was relatively convenient: perhaps only 10 - 15 minutes to walk to the city centre.  But the Aparthotel Adagio Access is towards the EU quarter and gusts should be prepared for a degree of traffic noise.",negative
"Excellent location for a first time traveler in Brugge.  Nice room, superb location, and friendly staff. Very comfy bed. Rooms well appointed. Enjoyable stay. Highly recommended for those looking for comfort. Quite far from Brugge train station. Unless you do not have big luggage, walking would be delightful.",positive

BREAKFAST WAS VERY NICE, I CANT COMPLAINING ANYTHING WITH BREAKFAST",negative
"The smell in the room was bad from the day 1. Because of that, I decided not to cook inside, as I did not want to make it worse. I also did not like that you need to pay for extra clean towels and to tidy up the room.,

Location is good as it is near EU buildings and the surroundings is quite in the evening and during the night. The personnel was extremely nice and helpful.",positive
"Amazing stay! Hotel is only a five minute walk from the main square and you just felt like you had the whole city to yourself. The peaceful area made for a fantastic nights sleep! Cedric at check-in was fantastic and couldn't have been more help. Fantastic staff all round!Rooms were beautifully designed, spacious and very cosy. The room was lovely and warm and the bed was divine to sleep in. On my next trip to Bruges, I will definitely return. Thanks Martin's Relais!",positive

Nice surprise. Good location and standard for that value of money.",positive
"Waiting for the check-in can take a while. I wonder if this cannot be prepared in advance so you do not need to spend 15 - 20 mins per room. But we were offered to have a seat. No drama but I guess this is still something that could improve overal satisfaction.,

The manager and his people weer very nice and helpful. Room was perfect and the food was delicious... we’ll be back!",positive
"Given the location next to busy Le Carré which we knew in advance, there are a large number of bar/clubs behind the building which all play extremely loud music until 5am. We knew this in advance and so brought ear plugs to sleep (recommended!) but apart from that all good! ,

We were very surprised with the apartment. It’s very big and very well decorated and taken care of. It was great to have 2 bedrooms each with a bathroom and a large terrace with excellent views. The location made it easy after spending the day in the city. Next to all good restaurants and stores and walking distance from all the major attractions. We parked in an indoor garage opposite for 24 hours for €20.
Great that the owner allows pets too! 
Very comfortable and nice beds.",positive
"I could not get the temperature in the shower right for the life of me! Being vegan, the breakfast options were a bit limited. I'm used to this, but it's a bit annoying when you pay so much for it.,

The interiors of this hotel are quite stunning. And it was a treat to have breakfast in a library room! Located a short walk from the Central train station and the Grand Place which was perfect for a short stay.",positive
"Overall, it was an amazing experience. The new owner of the place, Renzo, an Italian gentleman with a passion for cooking and hospitality turned our experience into a wonderful one. The dinner is a must have with mouthwatering Italian delicacies at Osteria Sapori (The Italian restaurant inside the hotel, owned by Renzo). They have a wide range of wine menu. The place is strategically located at Maasmechelen, only an hour drive away from Brussels, 20 mins drive away from Maastricht and 45mins drive away from the Three Country Border (NL, BG, GER) at Aachen. It is a great place for both romantic getaways and family vacations. We booked 3 rooms for the larger family visiting from Istanbul, Eindhoven, Dubai, and Vancouver. We'll definitely visit back in summer.",positive
"The fact that we were staying there four days, and the towels were never changed and the room was never cleaned. And when we asked it, the hotel say we had to pay for that service.,

The neighborhood",negative
"Lovely hotel, great location to explore Bruges and staff were friendly and helpful.",positive
"The only downsides were that a few of the reception staff were not so friendly as Suhail, and we would have appreciated a bathmat in the bathroom. Nevertheless we would highly recommend a stay in this hotel.,

We enjoyed our stay at the  Century Hotel from the 12th to 18th February.  On arrival we received a very friendly welcome from Suhail. He explained that since we were early, he would check if a room was ready and asked if we would mind waiting for 5 – 10 mins. After a very short time he was able to give us a key card and told us that we would staying at the 9th floor where they had just fitted new showers and mattresses. The room was clean and tidy and the beds were very comfortable.The breakfast was particularly  good for a budget hotel:  good choice of hot breakfast items, healthy options, and nice Flemish breakfast items and plenty of fresh fruit.A little research shows that the hotel was built in the 1920s for the Antwerp World Exhibition in 1930. On the first floor there’s a long nice breakfast room overlooking the iconic central station.The hotel’s position in very central to the tourist and shopping attractions that Antwerp has to offer. The staff at breakfast and room cleaning were very attentive and friendly.",positive

I tried to check in at 23:30 after a very long day of meetings and travel, and couldn't get in, nor reach someone by phone for the first 30 minutes. I nearly checked in at a hotel down the street. Eventually someone picked up the phone and explained the new mailbox number and code, so I finally checked in just after midnight.,

"It would be better if the windows were thicker glazed to reduce noise from the busy road that the property is located on. There was also noise from a party nearby on the first night we stopped and a window at the main entrance was broken.,

Apartment size offers excellent value for money - it has a spacious main bedroom with an en suite and a spacious lounge/dining area. Our host was welcoming and made sure everything was understood despite us speaking different languages. The property is located in an area close to shops, bars & restaurants as well as bus routes.",positive
Internet was horrible. I could not maintain a reliable internet access throughout our trip.,positive
"Restaurant not open at night.  No tea or coffee making facilities in room.This is supposed to be a 4* hotel.  It isn't.  Say 3+. The rooms are very nice, but when you've been working and driving all day, the last thing you need is to go hunting for somewhere to eat.  My dinner was a packet of biscuits.  And tap water.  Great.  4* ?  I stayed a Mercure last night and that was a 4*, great meal, good room etc.,

Well decorated rooms, good size.",negative
"The walls and carpets had stains/marks.  There is an additional charge to freshen the room (change towels). The room has a kettle but no tea sachets, filters or coffee.,

"We had a very pleasant stay. Great locatation, delicious breakfast and very professional, service-minded staff on all levels. No doubt we will return.",positive
"I arrived during a hot day and the appartment is really not suited for warm weather because if you open the windows there is a lot of noice from the street (on one side) and noice from the restaurant garden (on the other). Luckilly it rained so it gor cooler, otherwise I am not sure how I would have slept there. The water pressure is low, its OK if you want to take a shower, but washing dishes or filling a pot with water takes forever. WiFi badwidth is poor. I had to download the evening news overnight in order to watch them in the morning.,

The location is excellent, next to the EU complex. The appartment is wonderful with huge windows that bring sunlight into the rooms. The kitchen is fully equiped and there are even some food items in the fridge (for sale) if you don't want to go shopping.",positive

"No AC. No fridge in room. No tea\coffee making facilities. No view ,

Very clean. Good location. Classy hotel but lacks basics.",positive
"We went for the package room + dinner and we found that it was very pricey for what it was. The meal was very basic cantine-like food (smoked salmon and salad as first course, pasta and chicken for the main course and a chocolate dessert). The room was nothing close to premium... There was no boiler or tea/coffee facility. 
The parking space is also very limited. ,

The room was spacious, bathtub was good too. Breakfast has generous portions.",negative
"No kettle!  Very small toilet - strange that ensuite bathrooms did not include toilets.  Unfortunately very loud music playing all night - don't know if that happens every night!  No dedicated parking.,

"The shower head was broken, but in the end the manager himself came to fix it. The “art” on the walls was pretty seedy and outdated to be honest, please put some new paintings up!,

Charming hotel located in the middle of the lovely town Houffalize. Very nice Christmas decorations and lights. A lot of walks and ATB routes. Nice food, served in our room because of corona. We even had a jacuzzi in our spacious bathroom.",positive
"To make the appartment perfect, maybe the couch can be replaced. A long sit on this couch was a bit uncomfortable. But thats all we can think of.,

We were very surprised about the accomodation! We had the top floor with a nice living room and view over the streets of Liege.  The facillities in all the rooms were very good. Such as clean bathroom with towels and soap. Bedrooms including sheets and good quality beds, kitchen with available equipment and machinery (refridgerator, oven, Nespresso coffee machine etc) also Nespresso cups, salt , pepper and sugar present.The appartement is in the middle of the centre. Owner of the appartment is easy to contact. If we will visit Liege again, then we will definetly book this appartement again!",positive

"There was only one small criticism which we mentioned to the owners before our departure, and that was the lack of a door separating our toilet and bedroom. I understood that was only a feature of our room and not the other rooms.,

Breakfast was a good continental breakfast, different each day but fresh and lovely. The owners were very friendly and hospitable, the house and room exceptionally clean and crisp in terms of its level of decoration.

"It is not specified that the accommodation has rooms on semi-basement, the price being the same regardless of the floor. I get such a room with relatively high humidity for 5 days of accommodation. Carpet on the floor does not help against mold. The windows had only a simple opening system. Good luck we use the camera just for sleep; bad luck that after a day with the closed window, in the evening was a pretty unpleasant smell in the room.,

Close to the center of the city , the subway and the Central, Shuman and Luxembourg railway station. The staff was very friendly",positive

Location was absolutely perfect - that was why we'd selected the hotel . . . & it delivered.",positive

Nice hotel with clean rooms and very friendly staff.",negative
"There were only 2 sets of towels even though I specifically booked for 3 people.  The couch is very old and uncomfortable.  There were a few broken windows.  Being on the top floor, it got very hot and had to open the windows and doors, but it sits on  a busy street and it became too noisy to sleep with the windows open.  There are two bathrooms with showers but no toilets.  Only 1 toilet.  So the listing is a bit misleading.,

The apartment was very spacious.  Central location.   Two blocks to the parking garage.",negative
"Disappointed with our room compared to photographs we had seen. We had notified the hotel about my husband being Gluten Free due to health reasons, he asked for GF bread in the restaurant with his starter at dinner and was informed No bread from a very rude man who was waiting on. We asked for GF beer in the bar upstairs only to be told although the hotel have some it was in the restaurant downstairs and the barman could not fetch one upstairs for him!!We had other problems with the food in the restaurant and the attitude of who appeared to be the manager in charge that night. We left a message at Reception with regard to not being happy with our meals to no avail. We have heard nothing from the Manager whatsoever and this is supposed to be a 5* hotel. So very disappointed.,

Location, easy access with 24h reception.",positive
"Some areas are looking a little dated and could use a freshen up but nothing that detracts from its quality really. Can be noisy down the corridors. ,

"The staff was not kind as it should be at an hotel. It was more like they are forced to work there. Especially the staff in the kitchen ,

"need better couch more comfortable .one tower for every day, and little bigger bath towers.,

the bed comfortable, the couch average, very clean.location very good close to metroquiet area",positive
"Delicious breakfast was prepared by Owner the house  at chosen time, so we didn't have to be early birds on holidays.  Rooms and bathroom are spotless clean and cosy, furnished in nice style. Hosts were also happy to give us all the information about the activities, restaurants in the neighbourhood. And they went an extra mile being nice, by decorating the room with baloons because one of us had a birthday. Thank you! We had a wonderful stay in Les Lucioles!",positive
"Our room was spacious and comfortable with a modern feel to it. But as I said it looks like they are still doing improvements/renovations to the rooms and hotel itself. The hairdryer in our bathroom was outdated and the shower was a bit outdated as well - the shower was quite small (limited room to move, not good if you’re a curvy person) but the shower head was modern and water pressure was good! Our remote control for the tv didn’t work, perhaps battery was dead. We forgot to notify front desk but for us it was ok as we really didn’t watch tv; we were out most of the day and came back at night. Not a walking distance to central station but there are metros and buses walking distance from the hotel. By taxi it’s about less than 10mins from central station (cost about 12-13Euros). By metro it’s less than 20 minutes once you know the directions. We were fine with the location though.,

Overall the hotel and staff were wonderful! Staff were friendly and extremely helpful.Clean quiet boutique hotel with a modernness to it. Located in a quiet and nice area. But it looks like they are still doing more improvements/renovations to the hotel, which is good. Hotel is close to metros, busses, bistros/restaurants, supermarket, shops and major street. Our room was spacious and comfortable with big windows. The weather and temperature when we came was pleasant so opening the window was just fine for us, enough nice breeze to come in. We stayed for two nights so our beds were cleaned/made and towels changed on point.",positive
"the master piece was the very large bathroom with 2 rain shower, side by side.",positive
"We maybe just had bad luck...but there was obviously a party in the building the night we stayed. The smell of smoke and noise made sleeping nearly impossible until after 4AM. The apartment was well cared for, but the building was not well maintained in the common area.,

The apartment was very spacious, clean, and well-equipped. Central location--albeit a bit sketchy on a Saturday night--near bakeries and restaurants.",negative
"Staff very keen to sell extras and seemed to get a little upset when declined.Bathroom smelled of damp.,

Excellent spacious room, with comfy beds. Everything you need for breakfast. 2 mins drive to Spa circuit. Friendly staff. Recommend",positive
"The room was effectively in an annex which required additional key making it cumbersome. The stairway to the room was very narrow and it proved awkward to get luggage up the stairs.The shower room was small but functional.,

Breakfast was very good and unhurried. Room was clean and had an extra 'study' which was unexpected.",positive
"very friendly staff, good breakfast",positive
"Nonfriendly and nonhelpful host, 5th floor and small old-style elevator, 2 beds are quite small and moving at night, nearby parking is quite expensive and costs 20,5 eur/24 hours.,

Big apartment, great price (probably because of COVID), good location in the center with supermarkets and restaurants nearby",positive
"The bed was really uncomfortable ,

Location - absolutely spot on",positive
One towel was really really dirty and that ruined it for me.,negative
"The shower kept switching suddenly from cold to very hot, but that's nothing compared to the beauty of everything else.,

Everything about the hotel and the city were as I hoped they would be. Thankyou Martins Relais and Bruges.",positive
"I hated the twin beds.  Not the fact that they were separate, but the fact that the mattresses are so light, and with every turn it would move, which meant you spent mos of the night trying to keep the mattress on the base.  The mattress was  also stained and it just did not seem that clean to me.,

It is close to the Central station and we could walk to quite a lot of attractions and did not have to make use of public transport.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.",negative

it's close to centar and metro",negative

The hotel is charming, you can breath the past history just stepping inside the hall.The details are refined and everything is in line with the history of the building.Our room was the ancient kitchen, with the chimney, the oven and the atmosphere that reminds you the luxury of the rich families of the past.The courtesy of the staff complete the amazing experience we had there.The center was at 5 minutes by foot from the hotel.",positive
"The first room i stayed in, a standard single have poor quality furniture and mattress.  The Second room a standard double was a lot better.,

The Reception staff were very courteous and professional. The hotel was right next to Antwerp's beautiful central station. The shower and bathroom facilities were very good.",positive

"From the postcode it took us several 'sweeps' of Houffalize before we spotted the hotel. It's on the corner of a busy area so eyes were on the very busy road outside rather than peering for the hotel sign which was not immediately obvious. Having found the hotel, we then had the issue of finding a place to park, and by luck we found a car park across the road around 200m, away.Not sure if this is where hotel guests normally park, but I'm not exaggerating to say it was around 45 minutes after reaching the town, that we finally walked into the hotel. We found ourselves with our cases in the main bar/restaurant and someone eventually told us hotel reception is at the back of the hotel, which it was. Regulars at the hotel would probably use a side door, and when we walked out the following morning it looked as if there may have been parking in the street at the back. Meal in restaurant was good, though expensive, and service was slow. We sat waiting for our food for 45 minutes, and it wasn't busy. Served by a friendly man who also had checked us in and seemed to be doing everything, maybe with the exception of cooking the food ! Houffalize pretty town for a 1 night stop on the way back to ferry but don't think we'll revisit.,

The greeting at reception (when we found it !) was warm and friendly and the staff spoke very good English.The room, bed, bathroom and shower were reasonably spacious and adequate for a 1 night stop. We had our evening meal in the restaurant; there were others in the area but we were tired after a 300 mile drive.",negative
"room space was less than written,

breakfast was very good, location was in the middel of every thing",positive
"I didn't like that the cleaning service wasn't included in the whole payment of staying. We needed to pay extra if we needed to clean the room.,

I've really liked the hotel's location: it's very close to the city center and the old town. In 5 mins walk you can easily get to the Royal Palace and the park. Metro station Trone is in 100m distance from the hotel entrance.",positive

It was very dirty and small we booked for 2 nights and did not stay because there was a lot of staining on the mattress which we think was blood and urine the mirror was missing a large chunk and it was the same in my friends room also the carpets and walls were very dirty and the pillows were stained yellow .health and safety need to check this out",negative
"Single but large Duvet bedcover,

Breakfast",positive
"The rooms are small, Thank Goodness I was upgraded to a Jr. Suite. I booked this hotel because I really wanted a big room and a sauna after a hard Seminar. The women’s sauna is a closet with a heater and the men’s sauna is a Real sauna! I believe the pictures on your website misrepresent the property.,

Breakfast was a dream, and the room is very old and beautiful. Service was outstanding!You walk anywhere from the property.",positive

Good value for money, clean room and clean bathroom, lovely breakfast. Perfect location close to Central Station.",positive
"There seemed to be a lot of confusion in the dining room. The table in the restaurant they first gave us was not suitable for our dog (we did not want it in the middle of a high foot traffic area). When we relayed that, the staff said the dog was not allowed and we would have to sit in the bar. We explained that we had seen a dog earlier in the day sitting in the restaurant. We were seated in the bar and two other dogs showed up and they were seated in the bar area. The third dog showed up and they were seated in the dining room. The staff doesn't seem to know their own rules. We waited for a long period of time for our food and then told they were out of one item we ordered. So we ordered something else. A few minutes later, the original order arrived! Neither a big worry, but we would like to be treated like everyone else, whether our dog is with us or not. Many doors in the rooms needed to be fixed. You had to slam the doors shut which I am sure was annoying to other guests.,

the breakfast was very good- great selections. We ate in the restaurant one evening and the food was very good although there was much conconfusion.",positive
"Beds not so comfy (would prefer soft mattress)Very simply decorated room,

Perfect location next to central station and grand place Staff very nice and friendly",positive
"Unpolite staff, the room was smelling,

Convenient location",negative
The beds are very comfortable. Great breakfast selection. Reception were helpful with spare adapters when I brought the wrong one.,positive
"Doors closed very loudly, and there is barely any soundproofing, so if you are a light sleeper, you will have a hard time sleeping through it in the morning. The beds were very soft, so that might be uncomfortable for some.,

It's right across the central station and is close to the city center but is not within a lot of noise.",negative
Great room - quiet town - breakfast very good 😁,positive

"Excessive pricing of breakfast and in hotel bar.,

Didn't do breakfast as excessively priced @ 30€ per person",positive
"It all looks a bit old and used, they rennovated the breakfast room during the stay. I know its the European Quarter and everything, but 140 € per night is not justified in any way.,

Staff was friendly and helpful, breakfast is okay, everything I needed was there, but nothing special",negative
"I liked everything. I have no complaints.,

lovely heritage feel - just like the beautiful city that it is part of.the room was a delight, the staff friendly and breakfast a treat.",positive
"Table was detached from wall, no mini fridge or at least a bottle of water which is 1 EU.  Room could not be more basic. Free internet yes but the basic package so no speed, watching a movie on your laptop was out the question. My neighbor room had dogs, barking regular, surprised they let dogs in a hotel.,

Location is perfect which was the main reason of selection. Based on the price compared with other hotels in same location, you get what you paid for. Bed was very comfortable and toilet very clean which is an important factor for me.",negative
"No electric kettle in the room.,

Location was great. In the centre of town, near shops, restaurants and parks. Wish we had more time! Good breakfast too.",positive
"rather small rooms. Queen size of the bed is tiny. Rather slow internet. You can always pay for faster one, but in today's world it is ridiculous to pay for internet in a hotel, when it is free all over. Which is not the case in Brussels by the way, which is also very strange. No Internet in the trains - only on big stations! No Internet in the restaurants.,

Fantastically friendly, helpful and professional host at the reception. Don't remember her name, but she is Greek origin. Comfortable lobby. Location is just minute to walk to Grand Place and minute away from Central train station. The very heart of Brussels. Plenty of restaurants around, all major historical sites are all around within walking distance.",positive
Funny smell in the room,positive
"The room (99) stated a garden view but this was not quite correct as the view was floor level as the windows are level with the ground. I would have expected a better view as the description stated. Staff did their best to show us another room but that had no window so we stayed where we were.,

The location was great and the breakfast was the best thing.",positive
"Very slow wifi connection.i'm sorry but our room was not so clean or maybe it is because the hotel is old already,same age as the room carpet and the smell of our room is not that pleasant.good that we only stayed there for only a night.,

Location is near the station and shops,only a few meters away.",negative
"It was arranged but not as clean as expected ,

The location is great and the owners were nice and helpful!",positive
"The check-in and check-out times are really not convenient especially if you are travelling to Bruges just for the week-end which is enough to explore and discover this small yet beautiful city. I would have appreciate a later check-out (12 or 1 pm) as it was raining all-day long during our time (first week-end of July).  My sister whom I was travelling with was pregnant and she would have needed to rest a little bit. The host told me that we couldn't check-out later because of the cleaning lady hours. She had 5:30 hours to clean a bedroom and a bathroom ! I think that should be reviewed in order for guest to fully enjoy theirs bookings. A dirty towel was left in the bathroom and the bed lamps were not cleaned at all inside, full of dust !,

The rooms are very well decorated with taste. Bathroom is super nice and big with a window overlooking a quiet courtyard. The view from the room is really nice. The room is well located thos you need a little more than 5 minutes to reach the city centre. It is about 10 minutes to 15 if you discover Bruges for the first time and that you will probably stop at times :)",positive

Not a bad place but single room had no  coffee / tea making facilities",positive

The best place coming from the railway station; friendly welcome, at this time of the year even a choice of the floor (as I prefer to take the staircase); a good breakfast",positive
"When we arrived the apt was heated - but since it was not heated before it took more than a day to feel comfortable. But the heating was very good and we had extra blankets. The bathroom didn’t heat up well though and the hot water lasted for only one shower.,

The apt is very comfortable, seems newly renovated and is decorated very tastefully. It felt like home, very clean and well kept. The blankets were a thick duvet, very warm and comfy. The heating was on when we arrived, WLAN was fast, there were even coffee wine water and sweets and crisps for us. We felt very welcomed!",positive
"- A rather loud and continuous sound came from the bathroom (probably coming from a ventilation or the water heater), rather unpleasant at night.
- no door between the bathroom and the living room.
- the pictures on booking are much more clean than the actual place (wall painting and furniture in the bathroom were quite oldish).,

- The good location of the appartement 
- beautiful area, in front of the river 
- the bath
- the quality of the bed 
- the perfect reactivity and care of the landlord",negative
"My room was newly renovated and the paint was still smelling. When I arrived, 9 o'clock in the evening, in the room was very cold and it warmed very slowly after I opened the heating, During the night, it was a little bit noisy because the window was to the boulevard.,

Well located near metro station Madou, good breakfast, very clean.",positive
It is central located but loud if room to place Grasmarkt as people outside all night,positive
Excellent breakfast and good evening meal.,positive
"No coffee facilities in the room which was a real shame. The breakfast was a bit disappointing : the 1st coffee served was cold, the service a bit slow. We thought that it was slightly overpriced.,

The location is perfect ! 2 minutes walk to Grande Place, 5 minutes from the train station by foot. The hotel is very stylis. The room was very clean, quiet and comfortable. We used the concierge service to book a restaurant. He met our expectations 100%. We had a wonderful evening.",positive
"We visited in summer but we did wonder if the hotel would be warm enough on cold days. You do need to open the windows to let fresh air in as the hotel doesn`t smell very fresh. The stairs are really pretty steep and there`s no lift so you need to be fit on your feet.,

This hotel has character! I can imagine some travellers being shocked at the almost hidden entrance, the steep winding staircases and wind gusting into the rooms straight from the sea (if you leave them open, like we did) but we thought it was charming. Our dog was welcome and the guests chatted together at breakfast. Nobody used tablets or mobile phones - there weren`t signs up everywhere forbidding it - but the hotel doesn`t attract hich-tech workaholics or bored youngsters. The W-LAN worked perfectly but at breakfast we enjoyed our food. The restaurant was always packed with people eating fresh mussels and other local specialities. The town has beautiful houses in beautiful gardens and no two are the same. The beach is huge whatever the tide is doing. We watched kite surfers and walked for miles in both directions. We ran into the sea in September as did other swimmers because although the wind was strong, the water wasn`t cold at all. The beach was extremely clean. The waves brought in shells, not plastic. There are lovely paths to walk the dog, for example through the woods behind the dunes, and as long as you kept away from the beach directly in front of the promenade, nobody seemed to mind dogs playing on the sand or swimming in the sea like ours did. The picturesque tram stop is useful as well as pretty - we travelled all the way to de Panne on the one afternoon it rained. Dogs travel free. Dogs in fact are treated incredibly well in Belgium. Everyone assumes they are fun and is totally relaxed so naturally the dogs are relaxed too. In our experience everyone spoke English or German or both, or explained in Flemish so helpfully that we understood what they meant. Parking a car in de Haan couldn`t be easier and we never needed to pay. Our car broke down on the way to de Haan and we arrived very late but our host stayed up to let us in and greet us personally. She was always busy morning, day and night but like everyone in de Haan she was friendly and helpful.",positive

"The booking.com photos show a beautiful new facility, while I was gratly dissapointed to see a dirty carpet flooring with ugly wall platering and a very small “apartment” with the bed immediately next to the kitchen sink and microwave, all at 595€ for the five night stay! I have never been more “conned” into a high priced stay, and we had to pay immediately, even before we saw the rooms. To change your towels you had to add 2.5€ like this was not enough. And the location was not in the center or the EU district but three metro stations either way. Very dissapointed, would never recommend this as opposed to many other beautiful places in Brussels for the same price!,

The stafd vere nice and helpful, the bed was good, clean bathroom.",negative

The room, location, staff, breakfast, everything!",positive
"Staff and service! 
After 01 am they put the light of and they close the doer, you have to call via the bell and wait in that could till they open the doer!
There must be another way to get in without calling staff! 
And the next doer in the middle of the night they were making noises, I also enjoy the weekend, but I feel and respect around me!

"The problem was with reservation fee first charged to Visa, then removed, the day after departure reservation fee was once again charged for 48 hours (weekend) and finally removed on Monday afternoon. I do not know whom to blame: Visa card operator or hotel.,

We arrived pretty late at night, tired and hungry.  Our hostess went way above and beyond to ensure that we were fed; she drove 5km to show us the way to a local restaurant - which was magnificent!  Despite a horribly early start the next morning she was up and about to give us breakfast; outstanding!",positive

The location was spot on. We had a large furnished balcony that looked out over the central plaza.

The owner's were friendly and helpful. They spotted our car before we reached their home so guided us to the property. The facilities were really well thought out even to the finer detail. For example so often people provide microwaves but forget to provide microwave dishes to cook in but not so here. There was also a welcome bottle of wine and homemade preserve in the fridge. We liked the country location and enjoyed a walk into Redu from there.",positive
"Green neonlights from parking accross the street shine into room all night as only one window had a curtain. Other guests were really loud at 5 in the morning. TV only works with KODI, didn't work half the time and had to restart, no local tv channels.,

The property , consisting of the upper floor of a stone house with a separate garden entrance, is located in a beautiful rural hamlet not unlike the Cotswolds, with a stream and  surrounded by woods. It is very comfortable and has a particularly well equipped kitchen We arrived to find a bottle of champagne in the fridge and two champagne glasses on the kitchen table -very welcome after our long drive from England.

We couldn't watch TV at all 2) water in the bathtub was running yellowish for 15 mins , so scary , so we waited a while until it turns clear3) the noise of cars running at night was quite disturbing4) water kettle had some water left since last guests , house keeping should empty it out , also discover that one tea bag was missing a tea inside, it was empty packaging , again housekeeping should be very thorough when it comes to cleaning the room , should  pay more attention to this 5) bathroom door knob was broken the whole knob came off when I open it from outside , need to fix These are all the details that need prompt attention ,I wish I could get a partial refund for the stay !,

The floor of the lift was quite dirty. The variety of ham/cheese and egg dishes is quite poor, the lady is very nice though. The desk in the room is very small, for 3 Nights ok but for more?,

Room and barhroom larger than in Ibis, friendly staff, 24 hr reception, still withim walking distance to meeting",positive
"The noise from the street. Although not a main street there was still traffic/people noise. Room on 4th floor overlooking the street hotel entrance is on but windows do very poor job of blocking out or dampening the noise even that high up. ,

"The toilet was very close to the wall and low, not very comfortable... but that’s not where you want to spend much time... not such a big issue,

Nice room. We were there while restaurants and cafes were closed so we really enjoyed having the opportunity to order dinner at the hotel and the food was very good. Table + 2 chairs made a small dinning space. Minibar to keep cold drinks... Breakfast was brought in our room at requested time and was also very good.",positive

Location, overlooking a canal. Close proximity to the central square.",positive
"The single room was pretty basic: no kettle, no fridge, no storage box. Only two power sockets: you'll need to choose between charging your laptop or turning a desk lamp on. It's a bit cold in winter, but quite a right amount for me.,

Just a minute away from many various restaurants, a subway station and a tram stop. The room was pretty silent, everything worked. Nice selection of bread and grains at breakfast.",positive

"Cleaning staff was a bit rough in attitude. I have requested one additional towel (as there was no shower mat). She refused to give it to me with hard attitude. It was only after I told her that I don't need my room to be cleaned for the next 2 days., she decided to give me the 2nd day equivalent of additional towel. It wasn't upsetting, but, I was rather surprised of such attitude, which I am not so used to. Some reception staff were nice, but some weren't so dedicated, and gave me wrong info abt which bus/tram/metro to take where etc. They weren't there just as a security guard, so, I expect them to be more helpful and knowlegeable abt their own city!  Some guests on the same floor were very noisy and drunk from room partying. But, it wasn't as bad as hotels in Amsterdam!!!,

Excellent location, just right next to the main train station within the diamond district, and a few steps from the main avenue with shops and restaurants. The room I stayed wasn't huge, but, cozy, warm, bright enough, and I particularly appreciated the big sink area, with big mirror, where it was possible to spread out make ups and creams and hair arrangement items (good for girls!) One evening staff at the reception was very kind when I was facing some personal problems not related to the hotel.",positive
"The 3 first nights were not really comfortable as the room was not quiet and I smelled cigarette smoke (I am allergic and have breathing problems). Happily, thanks to the kind staff, I could change the room for the last 2 days.,

I really liked the second room when I changed (not on the street and larger)",positive

The bed was extra comfortable.,positive
Great location,positive
"Location is not great. It's a side street in the middle of town, so the view is either the aircon units of other buildings out the back, or the shops across the street in front. Car parking is in a public park maybe 400 metres away, and costs around 12 euro per day. Somehow we ended up with mosquitoes in our room.,

Nice breakfast, and the hotel bar was good.",positive

The beds are blissfully comfortable, the room has everything you need, the bathrooms are spacious, and both are spotless, air-conditioned and quiet. We ate in both the bar and restaurant and the food and service was excellent. But then the Forte family do exceedingly great hotels.",positive

"NOTHING,

GREAT !!
The Staff were more than great And Helpful we were there during ‘la Tour de France 2019’ and the roads leading to the hotel were closed the hotel sent us one of the employees ‘Alban’ to guide us through the crazy traffic he walked more than half an hour to reach us and another 1 hour in the car trying to figure out the quicker and less busier road to the hotel.
When we reach the hotel the Concierge Team welcomed us warmly with dozens of suggestions on how to spend the next 3 days in Brussels Specially Haluk et Jean in numerous instances they literally went out of the hotel with us to show how to reach a restaurant / Attraction - to my surprise the Concierge Team consist 6 personnel each specialized in a special area... and by the way they were extending the same service to all hotel Guests with the same unprecedented positive attitude at any time of the day.
With the hundreds of hotels that I have stayed with  during my travels I can easily say that I have never experienced a more professional concierge service like the one I have received from The Concierge Team at Amigo Rocco Forte.
In a nutshell. Great Location, Magnificent Concierge Team , Super clean Room and First Class Service from Doorman, Concierge , housekeeping till the Manager of the Hotel who was in the lobby most of the time.
Well Done Rocco Fort Team",positive

Excellent hotel located right across the train station and great value for money with excellent staff that always help when needed.",positive
"The hotel took an initial deposit of c€900 euro when we arrived. They then took a further full payment on departure. However, both these payments stayed on my bank account after my stay and I had to chase the hotel to take the full payment and cancel the initial payment as it was causing problems with my account.,

"The wi-fi access was sort of strange. Many websites were inaccessible. There was no shower handler in the bathroom.,

I absolutely loved the location when the central train station is across the street and the center of the city is in a walking distance. People were very friendly and helpful. We needed to sort out a quite complicated issue with the payment for the room (which was about to come from the university), and the manager assisted us with every detail. The wi-fi was actually much better than the last time a few years ago. And this time we also got two bonuses -- a fridge and a scenic view on the city roofs from our bathroom :)",positive

"Nothing. The entire stay was thoroughly pleasant.,

The bed in suite 14 was really comfortable. The staff were really friendly and provided us with all the information we required. The hotel parking is a seperate, secure area, but at 22 Euros a day, its quite expensive. We found a cheaper alternative was the Biekorf carpark. IT cost approx 16 euros for parking for 2.5 days. Its an underground carpark close the centre. It does get quite busy though.",positive
"The guy at the reception did not greet us and we had to wait a few minutes before he started to help us. Even then he did not even said hello. The space in the room was okay, the beds were fine and clean. The shower did not even had a holder for the shower, the shower curtain was dirty, all the buttons in the room were sticky and the heater did not work. There were only two electronical sockets.,

The only good things:- Beds- Location (ahead of Central Station and Parking nearby)",negative

"The rooms are facing a road used by trucks to pass to Germany, so in summer you have to keep the windows open (no Aircon) and it can make noisy nights. Also there are no blinds, just thick (not black out) curtains (but this seems to be the Belgian usage),

Staff is super nice, very welcoming and warm. The swimming pool has a very nice view to the garden and it’s covered, which is very important in Belgium as the weather change suddenly :) Their restaurant has very nice food, the meat dishes were exceptionally good!",positive

Smart position near the grand place and public parking near the entrance of the hotel nh",positive

A perfect place for transit passangers, only 3 minutes walking distance from the Bruxelles Midi station.The beds are comfortable, the room was extremly clean, the wife signo is  strong. I don't need more for a night.",positive
"The room was small but enough for a short stay and the bed was confortable as well. The location is good and ı could come from gran place to the hotel by walk. The breakfast is the typical one served in most european countries. As i came from Turkey, i found it too simple and with no many options.
Also, i had a special request and i had received the confirmation of my request by email. However, when i arrived they told me that it wont be possible to satisfy my request even after i showed the staff the e mail confirmation. Apperently it was booking confirmation. So, there is bad contact between the platform and the hotel which is a shame and leads to this kind of events. So not a very good 1st impression.
Also, when check out in the morning, before going to breakfast, i asked to the staff to book me a taxi 5 minutes after (time enough to have breakfast...) so i wont need to wait as i was in a hurry. And i dont understand why or how, he just told me im doing my best after i asked him if he had booked my taxi... Like, not so Hard task i guess. Anyway, i didnt understand the situation but he was to rude and stressful. So, i didnt get out happy neither. The rest of the staff was very helpful, specially the one who was there at night.",negative

"The closing of the wellness area is really early (7pm) and stated nowhere at Booking page. The reason why we choose this hotel is because of the wellness and usually at other wellness hotel, they close at 10 or 11pm. People are coming to this area to go to the park and spend the day there then come back to the hotel to chill at the wellness since there is nothing much around. Therefore it was pretty disappointing to know the wellness closed so early, if we knew this, we would have not choosen this hotel. ,

The staffs at the restaurant are super friendly specially the ones during dinner. Food is ok. Breakfast is actually ok too but the eggs and pastry usually finish if you come around 9am and they do not refill it so you end up just eating bread n cold cuts.",negative
"I arrived at 10:00 a.m. and I was let to wait till after the check-in time, while other new-arrived guests became their rooms immediately, before 14:00 o clock.At 14:10 I became my “reserved” room. It was on the 6th floor in the attic. Inside stunk of perspiration, the furniture was old and damaged, the TV small. As “relaxing area” was an office rotative scraped chair.I showed the receptionist my printed reservation (with picture and all the room specifications) and then I became the proper room.It is truth that I asked in my reservation for a room on an upper floor, but that means not that the room must be directly under the roof and in no case with inferior endowments.The second room was very nice, sunny, with view and very clean.,

The hotel is perfect situated, just few steps away from the Grand Place, Galleries St. Hubert, Central Station and St Michael Cathedral. In front of the hotel are lots of restaurants, chocolate shops and bars.",positive

The hotel is located near to the station and here it’s really comfortable to reach the city center. The staff is really nice and helpful!,positive
"I had a poorly presented room which was more like a hostel - over hot and no opportunity to regulate. 
No material about Brussels in the room
No water or option too make a tea,

Ground floor reception was all veryy satisfactory and a good standard of breakfast",negative
"It was filthy the shower hasn't been cleaned-there were multiple marks on the door from old water and had prints, the mattresses were soiled soft on a hard base- it was like sleeping on timber and there was only one sheet on the bed and the doona was half full. The pillows were like dolls pillows- lumpy and half stuffed. The staff were rude, obstinate and arrogant, it was like they didn't want you there at all. The exception to this rule was the female staff member who couldn't be anymore helpful. They were unable to print receipts because the printer wasn't working for two days- it could have been longer but we left. The carpet in the hallway and room made you want to keep your shoes on and the lift had marks all over it- no idea what it was. If you have options stay elsewhere. We wish we had!,

The location was great.",negative
"Internet was bad , slow and sometimes it cuts  and the fact that we had to pay euro. 50 per night for each room as a deposite which we were not aware of but thankfully we were able to manage it.,

Location is the most thing i liked. Everything you need is just awalking distance from the hotel. The staff were so freindly  and the rooms were very comfortable. Not to foeget to mention that we have been welcomed with Hot chocolate and Popcorn which was a warm gesture after 3 hours trip in such a cold and rainy day.",positive
It’s a beautiful hotel in a perfect location. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would absolutely stay here again.,positive
"Very nice hotel, very friendly staff and very clean and large rooms.",positive

All perfect from check in to check out. Rooms are very nice and spacious, with a quite comfortable bed.",positive

"Door man (dark hair Mediterranean appearance) was quite greedy, arrived with two light all rollers luggage he waited for 10 mins asking to take to room for us, same man when we leave with three heavy ones he couldn’t bothered to look or open the door, all he cares is tips not service. Wifi constantly drop out needs re signed in,

"A completely different hotel!,

This was  the nastiest hotel I have seen anywhere and for bookings.com to advertise it is pathetic.do you not ever research the properties you advertise on your site? We had four rooms booked for 8 total people and we everyone arrived, two of the rooms were so deplorable our friends went next door to the Hampton Inn, we kept two rooms but the hotel had the audacity to charge us for all rooms anyway, to which I will dispute with my card company. I plan on never using booking.com to book rooms as the standards are less than adequate, to say the least!",negative
"Shame no option for bar snacks,

Lovely staff, perfect location, comfortable rooms",positive
"The rooms we had in the old section of the hotel were a bit dated, but the ones in the newer area looked fine. The main issue with all the rooms were the beds, which were honestly not very good in our experience. Several of us had a poor night sleep due to this. In this price range, you usually get much better beds than this. Another issue we had, which is by no means a fault of the hotel, is the fact that it was a very long drive to the circuit of Spa-Francorchamps where we needed to be. Booking.com reported a 25KM distance, but due to a lack of main roads, this took about 45 minutes. So I would not recommend this hotel if you need to go to the circuit.,

The staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was decent. The spa facilities looked great, even though we didn't have time to use them. The hotel is located in a very nice quiet area.",negative
I could use a towel warmer in the bathroom,positive
Very good location,positive
The location is probably the best you can get in Brussels.  Staff were fantastic.  Only a short stay so didn't have much of an opportunity to appreciate what the hotel has to offer,positive
"Small room.Smell humidity.",negative
"The only small thing is that i personally could have benefited from having a way to heat water for tea in the room as i had a bit of a cold, but this is a small nit and moreover staff were very friendly and helped me with this late at night (providing tea) which was amazing. I don't think I can emphasize how great the hotel staff was.,

Amazing location, facilities were great, and the staff was super friendly (one of the best interactions so far with hotel staff), clean, great value for money.",positive
"The room is just good if need a room cheap, WiFi sucks when not close to door it not even a single bar, the room bad mattress is low and not good for people with back prob, the electrical sockets is weird with no adaptor available, reception service at night pretty rude.,

Location is next to the Central station literally can walk into through the left gate next to the Panos coffee shop",negative
"The bed was a bit too short for me (I am 1.73cm) so I guess for taller people it might be a real issue.,

Great location, spacious room, excellent view and fantastic food!",positive
"Nothing,

Huge room.   Comfortable bed.",positive
Ac set to 25 degrees far too hot. Windows did open a little but drunk youths partied all night in the plaza outside. Choice between heat and noise.  Either way little sleep.,positive
"It was a bit pity that one of the restaurant staff put away our plates for breakfast even though we were having meals.,

The location was great. We were able to get to the La Grand-Place and a famous waffle shop for a few minutes walk and the hotel staffs were quite friendly and professional. We are coming back there again when we visit Brussels.",positive

"Checkout time was 11AM, at 9AM we went to have breakfast, when we came back the touwels were taken by the cleaning lady already, we couldn’t shower before leaving. The bed was not comfortable, therefore a longer holiday same location is out of scope.,

Excellent location, clean room, very friendly staff, beautiful wellness facilities.",positive
"The biggest minus was that the room was very chilly. The only heating device is the aircon, and this was (A) not sufficient to heat the room and (B) it was extremely noisy so I had to put it off when going to bed. My need was to find an accommodation near Kontich. However the public transport is questionable, and the taxi took 40min to come from Antwerpen. Next day, taxi was pre-ordered which was then ok.,

Fast internet, very friendly and helpful staff, nice and big room, hot shower with good pressure. Waterboiler was broken, I got at the same evening a replacement.",negative

"Room at the third floor of a dependance across the road; incredibly no lift; 6 flights like the one in the picture for 130 euros. . Not even a warning of it. Small room. Extremely small shower. Do to a problem of the mixer, unusable (only extremely hot water coming out).Get to get out and across the road in order to have breakfast.,

The location. But is is full of hotels nearby, I'll never get there anymore. The fact that I had to stay only one night. They kept my luggage during the day (as every hotel do). The day manager was polite.",negative
Very close to central train station. Walk to restaurants and sightseeing. Good place to stay,positive

The location is impeccable, close to everything. Walking distance to the railway station and a number of major sightseeing spots. Very good buffet breakfast.",positive
"Service in bar is non existent,

Reception staff inside and at the door are extremely pleasant and helpful as well as the concierge",positive
"There were few restaurants in the area - several near the hotel but mainly only the small food outlets at the railway station.  A small refrigerator would be a useful addition in the rooms.,

The location was prefect for access to the train - we arrived by train and left by train.  The hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant.  Access to the old city area was easy by tram from the main station.  A supermarket was close by and were the food outlets in the main station.",positive
"The room they gave me was in a very bad part of the building, stains on the staircase that led to my room. The main issue that I have horrible was the amount of noice coming from the room above. The steps , the shower and the flush were as if they were in my own room. I could not sleep because of this. I asked for a new room that same morning and they said no, I asked in the evening and they said they only change rooms during the day. The morning after at 6 am the noise woke me up and I went to the reception where someone decided to make me pack my stuff  and that they would change my room. Which was one similar. Better looking but same noise coming from the floor above. I could not sleep until midnight and the morning after at 6.30 noise woke me. Having someone flushing the toilet on your head is disgusting. Worse hotel ever seen. I'd love to get a refund.,

Just that I arrived early inthe morning and even if i was supposed to have a room later they managed to find me one. I appreciated that.",negative

"Do not park anywhere near this place. Was advised by hotel staff to park in car opposite hotel and it cost me €224 to get back from the towing company( this was on a Sunday when they have a market) this was after asking 3 times if it was OK!

Was very central to town centre (about 15 minutes walk)",positive

"First room was a bit in disrepair (no lamp shade, part of the ceiling molding was gone) and the air system did not work.  Air system was necessary as the room looked over a busy square, so need for some airflow without opening the window. Moved me quickly and without fuss to another room  which was fully functional.  I have stayed here in the past, and it appears it is now in need of some refurbishment.,

If you are looking for a place to relax, with great walking and bicycle paths, this is the place.  The place is quiet and very close to the city.

The bathroom in general was clean, except the bathtub, which was  unusable. Most surfaces were dusty. A lot of dust in the room in general. The carpet had stains. In a room with 4 beds there were only 2 electric outputs - one of them next to the door.Only one of the four people at the reception actually was helpful. Cleaning lady did not come to clean the room when we put the sign, but everyday at about 4pm, while our baby was sleeping - so no one cleaned the room for four days, though she offered change of towels every time.",negative

There was no baking paper or other simple items to make cooking easier. 
No lock on the bathroom door. ,

The location was perfect. 
Spacious open kitchen/ dining area
Seperate toilet away from the bedrooms.",positive
"I would not recommend this place. On the pictures it looked really great but I did not feel comfortable inside the room. The room was large but not cosy. To reach the toilet I had to pass a hall and two doors. Somehow I was given a barrier-free room even though the hotel did not seem to be booked out. Right outside the hotel there was a cemetery and absolutely no light in the surrounding. It was very scary to come back to the hotel late evening. It was also very hard to find a place initially as Google Maps does not show the address correctly. Had the price been half of what it actually costed it would have been ok, but for this price one can find better places in Belgium in my experience.,

The owner was a very nice lady. The breakfast was amazing.",negative
"No refrigerator.  Otherwise, nothing at all. ,

"Very noisy street: cannot sleep with the window open and the smaller bedroom got very warm over night. No ventilation in the toilet. No shower curtain means the bathroom gets flooded. No pan in the kitchen. Wrong internet password was given before arrival.,

Relatively large. Even with 6 people it didn't feel too crowded. Excellent location close to central station and the main tourist sights.",negative
"The parking is on the small village square, and if you arrive late, all spots will be occupied by locals.Upon arrival we found the main entrance locked, and a sign requested us to call by phone, if you have one, for staff. We managed to locate a back door where we found an employee, who also spoke English. There was also some ""mixup"", so the bed wasn't made, this was eventually fixed.After leaving we realized that we had been charged EUR 20 more per night (3 nights) than agreed in the reservation. Unfortunately we didn't have the reservation papers available when paying, but that probably had changed nothing, as the person only spoke Dutch/Flemish and we don't.,

The room was pretty good, and the breakfast was ok.",negative
"The bed had a bad smell.
All other things were ok, but slepping at that bed was a bit gross.",negative
"The remote of the airconditioning was not working, but this was probably due to the Covid situation whereas the room was probably not used for a while.,

"Breakfast was limited both on seating and options. One day I didn’t get to sit for many minutes before getting on a table. The options are very limited as well.  No eggs at all. 
Heating in the room didn’t work. They provided me an electric heater which I had to carry to myself to the room on my own. I didn’t get this sort of service in my life. I have stayed in some bad hotels. 
Bed was not the greatest. Overall, highly disappointing stay. They charged me a lot as well due to busy times. I don’t mind paying more, but please improve your service. 
It’s unacceptable to tell the guest to take the heater to the room because there is no one there to do it. It’s not my fault your heating doesn’t work. It’s tour job to check and fix it before the guest arrives. ,

Cleanliness and that’s about it. The check-in and check-out staff in morning is also good. Rest it’s a complete disaster. I will avoid it in future.",negative
"Nothing ,

This was a lovely and warm place to stay",positive
"Very little. The lighting was not good - you couldn't see to put on make up or shave properly. It needs better lighting near mirrors.  There was coffee provided but no milks so we couldn't make a hot drink on arrival. We also thought it odd that there was an en suite in one room and a family bathroom opposite the other room, but no toilet in either. The toilet was located separately towards the living room. The curtains in one bedroom were far too small for the window and didn't fully cover the window. Just minor niggles, and yes we would stay again. ,

The flat was enormous and very well equipped. Comfortable rooms. Great location 2 minutes walk from the Christmas markets. Good communication from the owners and had no problem accessing with the key codes. Found parking literally opposite for 18 Euros for 24 hours.

"I booked a double room without breakfast but was offered a single room with breakfast as they said that the room I reserved had a technical problem, so accepted to stay in a single room, which was just a good size for myself. One problem to stay in this room was smell, which was a kind of sewage smell, so I had to keep the window open all day long.,

The hotel was very centrally located near to the Brussels central train station and provided a reasonablly good breakfast. I enjoyed staying in this hotel although I was offered a single room instead of what I booked as they offered a free breakfast.",positive
"The waitress, especially the receptionist, of the restaurant, can be more attentive as she made multiple mistakes in one order.  Ordered white toast and was provided wheat toast.  Ordered pancake and was provided waffle.  Also, I suggest the concierge to display the various tour pamphlets in the lobby.,

I arrived early in the morning and was able to have early check-in way before 3pm, which made the first day of visit a lot more enjoyable.  Actually, I have never experienced the same elsewhere.  The concierge team is excellent and very helpful.",positive

The room was spacious and tastefully decorated. There was a sofa in the room where we could sit in the evening to relax with the spectacularly good Belgian beers. We brought our bikes and kept them in the owner's garage for security. Just around the corner from the B&B is a the Kattenberg climb to warm you up. The countryside and river track are close by for cyclists and walkers. The restaurant Paulette (5 minutes walk) is outstanding and not to be missed. The host, Katrien, is friendly, welcoming and helpful. We stayed for five nights and could have stayed longer. This is an outstanding B&B and we'd love to come back.",positive

"Furnishings were inadequate because there was only 1 couch and no chairs. The only toilet was in the entrance hall and was very tiny and a person with girth could not use the facilities easily. 52 steps is way more than two flights of step. Pillows were not comfortable. There was no place in the smaller bedroom to put your luggage. It would have been nice to have more than one towel per person when staying for three days. It would be nice to have had paper towels and Kleenex.,

You can´t beat the location of this hotel in Brussels.   Its only 2-3 min walk from Grand Place and there are plenty of bars and restaurants around the hotel.   I´m quite often in Brussels and most of the time a stay in this hotel.   My room had a balcony which is a great extra and one of the main reason I choose this hotel.   The balcony is overlooking a small square next to Grand place.  This hotel has a mini-bar which actually contains drinks (beer, soft drinks, etc) which I like to have and is not the case in many hotels even though there is a mini-bar.",positive
"Suggest if one intends to get to the hotel by car to ask hotel concierge if there are any roadworks in the area as diversion signs are small and not very visibly displayed,

The hosts where super nice and the breakfast was abundant. The location is just perfect.

"A dream stay in AntwerpThis hotel is a beautiful nirvana in a fantastic location. We were very luck in that the hotel owner upgraded us to the their best suite. A genuinely wonderful room, with a beautiful bathroom and an arched roof. You could see the wonderful history of the building. The owner also gave a very good overview of the city and how best to explore it in our limited time - he was exceptionally friendly and helpful.We had an absolutely wonderful time in Antwerp and we'll definitely be visiting again. And there's no doubt - we will be choosing Hotel Matelote when we return. If you're looking to support a small hotel during this challenging time, while not compromising on quality or location, then this is an excellent choice.",positive

"Very nice hotel in a great location!  The family room we had (2 story room) was sparsely furnished and the beds were a bit hard. However, it was clean and suited our needs just fine. The bathroom was lovely. The room did seem a little overpriced for what we got. Also the stairs in the room were very steep and slippery and not the best for young children (normally I wouldn’t complain about this but since it was advertised as a “family room” I think they should have made these more child-friendly.",positive

We had an elegant room with direct access to the beautiful garden. The staff was extremely kind and professional. In addition, I feel the COVID measures were taken extremely serious. There were other guests in the premise however I feel very safe and distance was always maintained. In addition, we used the bar of the hotel to meet a couple of friends who came visiting us and I was very happy I could have them with us in such a cozy and reserved atmosphere instead of having to search for a crowded bar around in Bruges.",positive
The staff were beyond excellent,positive
"The beds were pretty firm as others have reviewed. The room was okay, but not up to 5* quality. One of the elevators got stuck while my wife and I were in it and the doors would not open, but after a couple of minutes it started working again. Strange but not big issue.,

"First of all, a couple of days before check in, the company changed us from this property to another property in Brussels, as we got little notice we had to accept the alternative booking.  This was inconvenient.  They told me by email it was an 'upgrade'  Well it wasn't.  When we arrived at the property the key box where I was to retrieve the front door key was located behind a locked gate.  In order to access the key box I had to force the gate open.  I got the keys from the key box, these only opened the front door and a post box where the apartment keys were supposed to be.  There were no apartment keys in the post box.  The email containing the instructions stated post box B12, there was no post box with that number, once we figured out which post box was correct there were still no keys there for the apartment.  I made 4 phone calls to Smartflats to gain help to access the property.  Eventually after nearly 1 hour at the property a lady arrived with the keys.  She was unable to explain why no keys had been in the post box (as per the bad instructions email).  Upon entry to the apartment we found that 1. the light in the toilet was not working, 2 there weren't 2 double beds as expected from our booking 3 the door to the bedroom with 2 single beds did not close properly and remained open as the bed blocked the door way 4 the hot water in the apartment lasted for approximately 6-7 minutes, meaning 2 of us had to have freezing cold showers on numerous occasions.  This ruined our weekend in Brussels.   I note that Smartflats never updated the fact that they moved our booking to another property on booking.com.  Smartflats personnel made no effort to apologize for the mess on Friday evening that wasted 1 hour of our weekend.  Totally unprofessional and unhelpful.",negative
"one morning we were woken up by a loud loud lorry that was parked in front of the hotel, but the hotel is not to blame for that slight disturbance,

Very well located boutique hotel for a city trip, excellent breakfast, we had a very spacious suite with an elegant and very comfortable decor, one of the best hotel mattresses I have slept on for a very long time, the hotel had a nice bar with a good selection of drinks and we rented bikes at the hotel which were perfect for a tour around and through the inner city, beautiful garden to relax in",positive

Good location near the train station within very easy walking distance and also only a 20 minute walk to the centre of Brussels ( which can also be reached by the underground from the closeby train station.

We had a short stay at the Warwick. Couldn’t complain about anything based on the price - €116. Staff were lovely. Well located. It was great. We received a complementary drink for sighing up to the loyalty program which was welcomed.",positive
"I have absolutely no complaints!,

Where to start! Nancy is incredibly friendly and attentive to details. The place is accessible by lift, which made it quite easy since I was carrying plenty of luggage. The accommodation seems to be oriented towards travellers who prefer a quiet and private stay with easy access to the shopping streets, beach, station and restaurants. The entire place is architecturally lovely and decorated with great taste and homely touches. The common areas feature design furniture (Eames and Le Corbuiser spring to mind), original artwork, plenty of natural light and lovely views of the cathedral across and the station five minutes away. The kitchen has a capsule coffee maker where you can make your own coffee at any time of day without disturbing the other guests.The room in itself is lovely, with a cozy bedroom with original parquet flooring (much like the common areas) and a relaxing bathroom with a full bathtub and vitraux. Plenty of thought went into the design and continued operation of the Windsor, I could not ask for anything more!",positive
"Carpet was stained and we were given the furthest room in the very back of the hotel, even though we booked way in advance.  We didn't call for service, but the room was very hot and were not able to adjust it successfully to get comfortable.  The price was very high.,

"It went well we were able to contact quickly but when we checked out they told us there is water on the mattress and what can happen if you have children and they make a mess. For that reason they have taken my deposit of 150 €, which I cannot find because water dries naturally. I also said this via whatsapp to them, they said ""It's 7 working days after your check-out, it's automatically so no worry you'll have it any days now."" But they lied and i did not receive it !!
So I wouldn't book this if you had to pay a deposit !!!! They will look for something small to take your deposit anyway !!!",negative

"This is a seven floor hotel made of wood, the stairs and the floor of the 7th floor are made of wood...
Dangerous in case of a fire.",positive
"The shower. You were either burning or freezing. It never kept the temperature. There are no chairs for outside use although the setting is suppose to be outside. No umbrellas for the extreme sun. We left the tent open which was a mistake and the rain left water marks on the lounge set. It cost me the deposit. So remember even in extreme heat you need to close the tent (it was 37) this means it gets boiling inside the tent for fruit and veg. Therefore the tents are not really ideal in warm summer weather since it is facing west.,

Will be good with kids. The farm setting is relaxing. The tent is well equipped apart from knifes to cut fruit and veg. The breakfast was good, just way to much.",negative
I requested a double bed and i had two single beds put together which is not a double bed!! So i paid for a double room for nothing!!,positive

The guest house has is very cosy, with nice design items and art inside. The place is very comfortable and located close to the train station, city centre and beach boardwalk.",positive
"The bed duvet was too hot and heavy; they couldn’t provide a lighter one but gave us two single duvets which were just as hot. We don’t like leaving the air-con on all night, blowing in our faces. But this is a problem in most hotels, like the lack of space for more than one suitcase!
Also we missed having tea- and coffee-making facilities in the room, but on checkout we were told we could have asked for a “kit” for this - wish they had told us on arrival.
The shower inevitably left a puddle on the bathroom floor; there was a drain in the floor for this but it is inadequate: the slope of the floor should be improved and/or the shower screen should be sealed.,

Liked the quiet good taste of the decor, the location close to the Grand’Place and metro, the extremely nice staff (especially the housekeeping ladies and bar staff), the spacious room and its noise-proof windows, the hooks for towels/bathrobes etc in the bathroom; the pleasant lounge bar.",positive
"Had a room with the view to the main street, just in front of the train station. It can be annoying in the morning, if you wish to sleep more, because it is quite noisy.,

Good value for money, good location, nice breakfast.",positive
